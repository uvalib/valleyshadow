<b>The Repository for the Campaign! Grant and Colfax! Humanity, Liberty, and
                    Freedom! No Treason! No Repudiation! No Copperheadism!</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Editors Cook and Hays announce that from July through November the
                    Repository will be published as a cheap campaign paper at reduced rates. "The
                    publishers are led to do this by the advice of prominent Republicans throughout
                    the county, who believe that the dissemination of political truth among the
                    voters of the county can be more thoroughly and cheaply effected through the
                    medium of their own journal than any other way." Single copies will cost $.90.
                    Citizens may also purchase 10 for $8.00, 20 for $15.00, and 35 for $22.75.<br>

<b>The Campaign Repository</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper announces special five-month subscription deals for clubs or
                    individuals to promote circulation of the paper during the campaign. "We can do
                    but little ourselves without the aid and cooperation of loyal men, but we hope
                    with them to give the Repository a circulation during the campaign that will
                    reach every voter in the county who does not now take a political newspaper, and
                    tell forcibly on the results in October next. We hope that Republican
                    organizations will be perfected in every township in the district, and that one
                    of the first and most important objects will be the diffusion of good, radical
                    reading among the people."<br>

<b>James Buchanan</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A. K. McClure eulogizes James Buchanan as a talented, able man, who
                    nevertheless did not have the qualities needed to be a great leader.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Organization</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article begins with an enthusiastic endorsement of Grant and Colfax,
                    nominees for the Republican party for President and Vice President, before
                    detailing the strengths and weaknesses of the Republican part's position in the
                    coming election. Among the weaknesses of the Republican position listed is the
                    strength of the "whisky ring," who campaign for the Democrats in the North and
                    have put several key states into play. Without strenuous efforts, the author
                    claims, the Republicans will lose the election. <br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The standard bearers of the Republican party have been chosen, and they are
                        everything that the people could ask for. Their eminent public services
                        appeal so powerfully to the inherent sense of right and justice in the
                        American people for their earnest support, that to address arguments to the
                        intellect of men, to convince their understandings that they should vote for
                        Grant and Colfax, seems like a superfluous undertaking. It is like arguing
                        that two and two make four; like reasoning that one should support his
                        family, or that honesty is the better policy, or like advocating any other
                        self-evident proposition. The platform of principles declared by the Chicago
                        Convention is wise and just. The resolutions firmly declare that the
                        principles enunciated at the birth of the Republic, and which sustained the
                        country through the trials of the late war, should constitute the civil and
                        political rights of the citizens of all the States. They pledge the faith of
                        the Republican party to the payment of the national debt in the spirit and
                        letter of the law. They urge conciliation, and harmony, and peace,
                        everywhere, economy in the affairs of government, a stable financial system
                        and the reduction of the rate of interest of the national debt.</p>

                    <p>Our candidates are nominated more than a month earlier than will be those of
                        the Democracy, and we have still until the 4th of July to perfect our
                        organization before they are able to begin. We have the advantage of former
                        triumphs, though a traitor to the principles upon which he was elected
                        controls the administration in the interests of the enemies of the country.
                        We have to-day a unanimity and an earnest determination on the part of the
                        loyal people everywhere, that has never been surpassed. The morale of the
                        party never was better than at this time.</p>

                    <p>On the other hand, the Democracy are divided and disorganized. They speak of
                        the "different branches" of the party. They have war Democrats in the East
                        and peace Democrats in the West. They have nullifiers in one section and
                        repudiators in another, and those who favor neither or all of these, as
                        circumstances demand, in another. Within a few weeks of their National
                        Convention, they have no candidate upon whom they can reconcile, and no
                        policy which they dare to adopt. Never having had any principles, their
                        possibilities are unlimited and reach from the unhealthy lowlands of visible
                        admixture bills and white men's governments, to the Delectable mountains of
                        universal suffrage and universal freedom. Somewhere in this long line they
                        will plant their flag, and sound the call, and the unwashed will gather
                        together, but just where this will be, their most astute politicians dare
                        not predict.</p>

                    <p>These are some of the advantages we hold, and if properly used we can make
                        them tell. Against them are some disadvantages which we must meet, and as we
                        meet them will be our success. We have an administration and a President
                        working in the cause of the Democracy. An organized army of corrupt office
                        holders numbering 40,000, armed and equipped with the unrestrained plunder
                        of the last two years, and backed by the whisky ring, are fighting for a
                        continued lease of plunder and power. Their license to rob the government
                        will last just as long as the administration is in the hands of the
                        Democracy. If Grant and Colfax are elected these harpies must bid a long
                        farewell to the fat flesh pots into which they have been inserting their
                        beaks and claws, and to defeat this they will pollute the whole land with
                        the fraudulent use of money. Pennsylvania and New York and Ohio make up the
                        disputed territory in this campaign, and in these the power of the office
                        holders and the whisky ring is strongest. They contain several of the
                        largest cities where money is always plentiful, and where the population
                        with whom money and whisky are potent, always abounds. Throughout the rural
                        districts, these agencies cannot make the headway they can in the cities,
                        still they will be used to an extent never known before, and unless
                        counteracted they may loose us these States. The Democracy must carry all
                        States to win. Unless we carry two of them, perhaps all three of them, we
                        lose. And let us not deceive ourselves, unless we organize thoroughly and
                        systematically in every county, township, ward, and precinct and work, each
                        man as he had the power and influence, we will
                        lose. Confidence that is not based on an intelligent and exhaustive
                        understanding of the work to be done, and the agencies to do it are illy
                        founded and should not be trusted. We deceive ourselves if we believe that
                        because we have great principles at stake they will take care of themselves.
                        They will not. The names of Grant and Colfax, the most inspiring in the
                        land, will not alone bring success. The efforts of politicians who are
                        striving for offices, however worthy and commendable they may be, cannot
                        bring us success. Torchlight processions, and stump speeches, and flaming
                        hand bills make up the show and display, and do good, but the real work is
                        deeper and quieter.</p>

                    <p>Now is the time when the work must be done, if at all. There are yet four
                        weeks until the Democratic Convention at New York. Until that time the
                        Democracy are powerless to do anything but abuse the Republican party and
                        candidates, for they know not who may be their leader or what their policy.
                        In these four weeks we should have a thorough canvass of the voters of every
                        district and county. We should have a Grant Club to meet in every school
                        house. We should have committees appointed to see that every voter's right
                        to vote was secured, and to procure and distribute good Republican documents
                        and newspapers. It will not do to wait until the meeting of the County
                        Committee before these things are done. Let the townships organize for
                        themselves, and by so doing forestall the enemies of the country when they
                        come, as they surely will, to disseminate error and falsehood among the
                        people.</p>

                    <p>Union men of Pennsylvania, victory is ours to accept or reject. By our energy
                        and perseverance we will succeed, or by our indifference and indolence we
                        will fail. By a long and bloody war we have rescued the Government from the
                        hands of traitors; by prompt attention to patriotic duty we will preserve
                        it. The triumph of Grant and Colfax will complete the restoration of the
                        South, in the spirit of right and freedom begun by Congress, and present to
                        the gaze of the world a sublime spectacle, a government which recognizes the
                        rights and liberties of all, be they white or black.</p>

<b>Gen. Grant's Letter of Acceptance</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article applauds in glowing terms Grant's acceptance letter concerning
                    his nomination for President.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>After all, Democratic journals will be constrained to admit that General
                        Grant wrote his own letter of acceptance of the nomination of the National
                        Republican Convention, and that he has written it exceedingly well. General
                        Grant seems to be as little given to rhetorical as to military dress parade;
                        and in this respect offers a striking contrast to one General M'Clellan
                        whose political and military shows enraptured the multitude, but who proved
                        totally unfit for active service.</p>

                    <p>This letter is eminently worthy of its distinguished author. He accepts the
                        nomination and its responsibilities with as much modesty, and as much
                        courage, as he accepted the command of our armies in the gloomiest period of
                        the war. Brevity could not be more brief, nor language more clear and direct
                        than his. He does not waste a single charge in feeling the position, nor
                        employ a single line in sickly self laudation, so common in our times, by
                        disingenuous asseverations of unworthiness for so great an honor. He
                        expresses his satisfaction with the unanimity which pervaded the convention,
                        and his belief that their action is endorsed by those who saved the country
                        through its recent trials. And in a few words which must carry confidence to
                        every loyal man, he adds that "if elected to the office of President of the
                        United States, it will be my endeavor to administer all the laws in good
                        faith, with economy and with review to giving peace, quiet and protection
                        every where.</p>

                    <p>If General Grant is elected there will be an end of pet policies in the
                        administration adverse to the declared will of the people and contrary to
                        the laws of the land. The President will be what the Constitution
                        contemplated he should be, executive of the laws, and not the judicial
                        journeyman who during three years has failed to execute the laws, but well
                        nigh succeeded in executing the Government.</p>

                    <p>It is said that no one so appreciates the sweet blessings of peace as he who
                        has participated most in the bloody horrors of war. Gen. Grant says "Let
                        their be Peace." He has seen all the glory and grandeur as well as all the
                        sadness and gloom of war, and he has seen how the treachery of Johnson and
                        the faithlessness of renegade Senators have made these years since the war
                        little better than the war itself. He is an original peace man. He was for
                        war that we might have peace which we could retain. He fought for a nation's
                        life, and he won. Who but he should preside over the destiny of that nation
                        now that he has saved its life?</p>

                    <p>The Republicans of Franklin county had a meeting in the Court House, on
                        Tuesday, the 2nd inst., for the purpose of ratifying the nomination of Grant
                        and Colfax. The building was well filled and everything passed off
                        pleasantly. Franklin County is working in earnest for the Union candidates,
                        and is opposed to the Repudiation policy of the Southern traitors and
                        Northern copperheads. Eloquent addresses were made by Messrs. Stewart,
                        McCauley, Stumbaugh, M'Clure, and Chambers - able lawyers of this bar.</p>

                    <p>On motion, Jacob Henninger was called to the chair as President, H. E. Wertz
                        and Daniel Skinner as Vice Presidents, and J. Jeffries and G. J. Balsley as

                    <p>On motion of I. H. McCauley, Esq., the following resolutions were adopted:</p>

                    <p>Resolved, That we adopt as the expression of our
                        political faith the principles promulgated by the National Union Republican
                        Convention which recently assembled in the City of Chicago.</p>

                    <p>Resolved, That we cordially endorse and ratify
                        the action of that convention in nominating the greatest Captain of the age
                        - U. S. Grant, and the model statesman of the nation - Schuyler Colfax, as
                        the Candidates of the Union Republican Party for the offices of President
                        and Vice President of these United and Reconstructed states.</p>

                    <p>Resolved, That in General Ulysses S. Grant we
                        present to the American people, for their support and suffrages - a soldier
                        without an equal among the brave and patriotic of the land - one who has led
                        our "Boys in Blue" to victory through blood and danger in many a hard fought
                        battle - one who has, in the past, proven himself competent for every
                        emergency - who by his prudence, skill, and indomitable perseverance has
                        again and again wrested victory from defeat and saved our beloved Union from dismemberment and anarchy. Patriotic,
                        prudent, and upright - ever careful of the people's rights - ever battling
                        for the cause of justice and free government - a Nation's gratitude is due him for a nation's safety and
                        prosperity - and the unprecedented unanimity with which he was nominated
                        gives assurance to the loyal millions of the land, and the friends of
                        Freedom and Liberty every where, that he is to be the next occupant of that
                        high post of power so worthily filled by a Washington and a Lincoln, but now
                        so terribly disgraced by a recreant Johnson.</p>

                    <p>Resolved, That in Schuyler Colfax, our candidate
                        for the Vice Presidency, we recognize the outworkings of our Democratic,
                        Republican Institutions. Born in humble life, without the aid of early
                        education, wealth or family connections or influences, he has risen by the
                        force of his native talents, energetic will, and sterling worth, to the
                        first rank among the great and honored of the nation. In him we have a
                        statesman of extended experience, unblemished character, undoubted
                        integrity, and acknowledged firmness and ability - one who, if the sceptre
                        of authority should ever pass into his hands, would wield its powers for the
                        best interests of the people, in all sections, without regard to
                        nationality, race, condition or color.</p>

                    <p>Resolved, That we cordially endorse and ratify
                        the action of our State Convention in placing again in nomination for the
                        offices of Auditor General and Surveyor General, Brigadier Generals John F.
                        Hartranft and Jacob M. Campbell. Having filled those offices acceptable for
                        the past three years, and having been renominated for the coming term, these
                        faithful public servants, and war worn veterans are entitled to and should
                        receive and support of all good citizens of the State.</p>

                    <p>Resolved, That we repudiate all schemes for repudiating our National indebtedness; or
                        violating our National engagements. Having had the benefit of the millions
                        invested by our own citizens and by Foreigners in our National Loans and
                        Bonds, we should rigidly, and unscrupulously maintain our National faith in
                        the spirit in which our contracts were made. If the interest upon our public
                        indebtedness be too great, or those kinds of investments be too much
                        favored, it is the duty of Congress to make all needful corrections as soon
                        as it can be done consistent with the public faith and public interests.</p>

                    <p>Resolved, That we hold both treason and traitors in abhorrence,
                        and we regard deception and treachery, whether in High places, or in Party
                        fealty, as sufficient to disgrace and damn politically all those who are
                        thus guilty, whether the case of their action be thirst for power, political
                        jealousies, or pecuniary gain.</p>

                    <p>Resolved, That we applaud the fidelity and
                        firmness of those thirty-five members of the United States Senate who
                        unswerved by the blandishments of power, unshaken by the influences of
                        corruption, and unmoved by the machinations of traitors and Catalines in
                        their midst, performed their whole duty to their country, and declared the
                        recreant occupant of the White House guilty of High Crimes and Misdemeanors
                        "meriting removal from office." They will ever receive the commendations of
                        a grateful people whilst those who joined hands with the betrayer, and the
                        friends of rebels will descend to the obscurity from whence they sprung.</p>

                    <p>"Unwept, unhonored, and unsung" except as traitors to their country's dearest
                        rights in the hour of extremity.</p>

                    <p>Resolved, That to the soldiers and sailors who
                        upheld their country's flag, vindicated their country's honor and secured
                        her integrity as a Nation, we owe the acknowledgments and rewards of a
                        grateful people. They served us bravely and well in the hour of danger, and
                        they should be remembered generously and freely in the hour of peace and
                        prosperity.</p>

                    <p>The meeting adjourned to meet on the 9th inst., for the purpose of forming a
                        Grant and Colfax campaign club.</p>
