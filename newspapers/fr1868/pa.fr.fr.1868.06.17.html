<b>Salmon P. Chase</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>After blaming Chief Justice Salmon Chase for Jackson's acquittal, the
                    article outlines Chase's history as one of ambition for the presidency leading
                    him to betray Lincoln and his country.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The master spirit of the late defection in the Republican Senators was Chief
                        Justice Chase, and to him more than to all the others, outside of the whisky
                        ring and its money, is Andrew Johnson indebted for his acquittal. In this
                        action of Mr. Chase the Republicans as a party, are grievously disappointed.
                        I am not. I did hope that regard for his own reputation might save the
                        nation from the betrayal it has suffered at his hands, but I am not
                        disappointed in the capabilities of the man. He never was honest as a
                        politician, however blameless in private character, and unfortunately his
                        political aspirations have been the guiding star of his whole life. While,
                        therefore, he has been generally regarded as one of the most earnest and
                        consistent of the anti-slavery leaders, those who know him well have not
                        trusted him. He first entered the Senate by a coalition with the Democracy,
                        and joined them to consummate a glaring fraud. Although not legally elected,
                        he held his seat by the aid of the Democratic Senators, including the
                        pro-slavery leaders of the South. This was twenty years ago, and from that
                        time until now he has had but one ambition, to which every action of his
                        life has been subordinated. He believed that destiny had marked him for the
                        Presidency, and he regarded all who opposed him as warring with fate. What
                        Presidency he should attain, was a secondary consideration. He probably
                        hoped to be the Executive of the whole Union, but failing in that, he was
                        willing to hold a limited sceptre and take a fragment of the Union as his
                        empire.</p>

                    <p>When Abraham Lincoln became President, over the pretensions of Mr. Chase, it
                        was a crushing blow to his ambition. He then despaired of ever becoming
                        President of the United States, and he avowed himself an earnest
                        disunionist. I do not deal in conjecture, nor do I exaggerate the position
                        of Mr. Chase. Soon after the inauguration of Mr. Lincoln, Washington was
                        thrown into consternation by the apparently authenticated rumor that Fort
                        Sumter was about to be surrendered without a struggle. I was in Washington
                        at the time, and hastened to Senator Wilson and Mr. Stevens to ascertain
                        whether such a suicidal act was seriously contemplated. Both had been aware
                        of it, and had traced it to its foundation. It was the policy of Secretary
                        Chase, and he had pressed it with earnestness upon the President and the
                        cabinet. Messrs. Seward and Blair, of the cabinet inclined to favor the
                        surrender policy of Mr. Chase, but the rest of the cabinet and the President
                        refused to sanction it. What Chase meant was then not apparent. His action
                        was imputed to moral cowardice or to some vain ambition to be the
                        pacificator of the troubles of 1861. But, after the battle of Bull Run, when
                        he supposed the opportunity favorable for his real purpose, he exposed the
                        cloven foot and declared for the peaceable dismemberment of the Republic.
                        After war been inaugurated by the rebels, Mr. Chase urged upon Mr. Stevens
                        and others the necessity of stopping the conflict and recognizing the
                        Southern Confederacy. I need hardly say with what scorn the Old Commoner
                        repelled the proposition of Mr. Chase, and warned him that such treason in
                        the cabinet would not be tolerated by the nation. His ambition, and his plea
                        for disunion, was a Free Empire where he could rule - preferring a fragment
                        of the Union that would gratify his pretensions to a united government that
                        might select others to fill its places of honor.</p>

                    <p>Again in 1863-4 his restless ambition made him war with Mr. Lincoln. With
                        that charity he ever exercised toward all, Mr. Lincoln bore patiently with
                        the schemes of his Secretary to supplant him. On but one occasion I saw Mr.
                        Lincoln's forbearance taxed beyond its endurance, and that was when he found
                        his own power and patronage employed by Mr. Chase, one of his own
                        subordinates, to defeat himself, as he then foreshadowed the coming removal
                        of the faithless Secretary. With Mr. Lincoln words of unkindness were very
                        rare. No man ever judged others more charitably, and when he complained of
                        Mr. Chase's treachery, it was in very different tones than was manifested in
                        the correspondence attending Mr. Chase's withdrawal from the cabinet.
                        Subsequently, when Mr. Lincoln was called upon to nominate a Chief Justice,
                        he hesitated long before he reconciled his own mind to take Mr. Chase. He
                        knew that ambition was the stumbling block of the man, and he feared that
                        the place might be prostituted to attain political ends, or that
                        disappointment might cloud the judgment and endanger the integrity of the
                        first judicial officer of the government, so cautious was the President on
                        the subject and so long did he hesitate, that Mr. Chase's friends finally
                        assured Mr. Lincoln that if appointed Chief Justice, the measure of his
                        ambition would be filled, and he would no longer aspire to the Presidency.
                        This assurance was, I know, solemnly given - and certainly with Mr. Chase's
                        approval unless Mr. Lincoln was deceived, - before the nomination was made,
                        and but for that assurance the appointment would have been conferred upon
                        another. How that faith was observed, the public well know. As soon as he
                        was clothed with the judicial robes, he started out on a political tour
                        through the south, and degraded his high office by political harangues
                        advocating a policy that had no sanction in law, and, in his judicial
                        capacity, swearing in municipal officers chosen in utter disregard of State
                        or national authority. Since then to attain the Presidency has continued to
                        be the one purpose of his life, and while he hoped to be accepted by the
                        Republicans, he was faithful to the policy of the party. But as popular
                        sentiment gradually concentrated on Gen. Grant, he became the prey of his
                        disappointment until it made him the foe of every conviction he had
                        professed to cherish for twenty years. As he was willing to be President of
                        a fragment of the Union in 1861, if he could not be President of the Union,
                        so in 1868 he would be President under the Democratic ticket. If Republicans
                        and Democrats both pass him by, he is willing to be the candidate of the
                        Bread and Butter fragments left as a legacy of Johnson's political failure.
                        He gives audience to two ambitious office hunters of Philadelphia, who speak
                        for the people of the United States as did the two tailors of Tooley street,
                        London, for the people of England, and formally commits to them his
                        Presidential expectations. Beyond making the infamy of Johnson in some
                        measure respectable by comparison, Mr. Chase has accomplished nothing by his
                        apostacy to himself, and the Republic will move on, under the guidance of
                        the faithful millions who have saved it from every assault, until it attains
                        the full fruition of the logical consequences of the war. It has survived
                        the perjury and rebellion of the Davises, the Lees and the Breckenridges; it
                        has maintained the fruits of its triumphs in defiance of the apostacy of the
                        Johnsons, the Dixons, the Cowans, and the Doolittles, and it will not be
                        turned from its high mission in behalf of Freedom and Justice by the
                        corruption of the Rosses and Fowlers, or the vexed ambition and pitiable
                        madness of Salmon P. Chase.</p>

<b>Penna. Reserve Association</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article describes the Pennsylvania Reserve Association, a purely
                    social veterans' group for the only unit in the Northern forces composed
                    entirely of men from one state. The author describes the Reserve force's history
                    and applauds the association, encouraging similar groups among other veterans.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The surviving members of the Pennsylvania Reserve Corps, anxious to
                        perpetuate the friendships formed and consecrated during their memorable
                        service "at the front," have organized an association, which meets annually,
                        on the 30th of May, the anniversary of the battle of Bethsada church, the
                        last engagement in which the corps participated.</p>

                    <p>At the annual meetings, an oration is delivered, after which a banquet is
                        served, when toasts and speeches enliven the festive board. The toasts are
                        emphatically "dry," as the only "ardent spirits" present at the re-union are
                        the gallant fellows who carried their canteens where "the expanse" was most
                        deeply and unbeautifully gray.</p>

                    <p>Politics are entirely banished from the association, which has no other
                        purpose in view than social enjoyment among comrades.</p>

                    <p>The Reserves are well circumstanced for such an organization. They stand in
                        the history of the rebellion as the only Division furnished by any of the
                        loyal States, and as such they preserved their individuality throughout the
                        war. Other regiments from our Commonwealth have records in every respect as
                        bright, have performed service every bit as valuable, and have done duty
                        every whit as valiant and trying; and were composed of men just as nice as
                        their sentiments and as fond of fraternization; but, with few exceptions,
                        and for short periods, they were mixed among brigades made up of troops from
                        various States, and their Pennsylvania distinction was lost in the title of
                        the command. The Reserves were separated by the character of their
                        organization, by their peculiar designation, by their numbers, constituting
                        them an army in themselves, nearly, if not quite, as large as Scott's army
                        of invasion in Mexico; and they formed comparatively few companships outside
                        of their own body. In their ranks were all arms of the service - artillery,
                        cavalry, infantry - an army within an army, a compact organism, fully and
                        formidably equipped, from the ringing sabres of the knightly Bayard, the
                        unerring repeating rifles of the romanceful Bucktails, to the quick flashing
                        guns whose hot trunnions were baptized with the blood of our own Easton and
                        Kerns. This peculiarity of the corps gave it great mobility, and hence we
                        find it transferred from army to army, and from point to point, as
                        emergencies arose; and, we are proud to say, that while it made our State
                        marked among the warring hosts, it never sullied our good name. Nay, ever
                        brightened it!</p>

                    <p>The object of the Reserve Association, we repeat, is entirely social - no
                        ulterior design lurks among its purposes. It has no political significance
                        whatever. Men prominent in all parties meet without a clash - their partisan
                        attachments are lost in the deep affection which swells in bosoms that
                        throbbed together in the long years of peril and "of high emprise," - None
                        of that miserable and unmilitary spirit, which can meanly soil the laurels
                        of a comrade, - and which reveals unmistakably that the breast which can
                        harbor it, may have possessed the courage but never had the generosity or
                        the espirit de corps of a true soldier - finds
                        indulgence among the brave associates. Here we find such men as Curtin, and
                        Todd, and Roberts fraternizing with M'Candless and Ent, oblivious of the
                        fact that outside this charmed circle they are representatives of hostile
                        interests and affinities. Another pleasing feature of the association is
                        that it is not mainly in the hands of the shoulder strapped: its directors
                        are chiefly privates and non-commissioned officers.</p>

                    <p>The second annual meeting of the society was held at the Academy of Music in
                        Pittsburg, on the 30th ult. The attendance was larger than was anticipated,
                        all the regiments of the corps being represented but two. The ordinary
                        business having been transacted, and directors and officers for the current
                        year elected, the annual Oration was delivered by Gen. Lemuel Todd, of
                        Carlisle. The General acquitted himself with great honor, delivering one of
                        the most elegant and masterly discourses it has ever been out good fortune
                        to peruse, and, with a grace and power that stamp our neighbor as one of the
                        most accomplished orators of the State. We of this valley know the General's
                        force at the bar and before the public, but we confess, that our estimate of
                        his literary ability is greatly enhanced by his finished effort on this
                        occasion. At the banquet, speeches in reply to toasts were made by several
                        distinguished gentlemen, the most noted of which was the feeling and
                        eloquent response of Gov. Curtin. He gave an interesting history of the
                        Reserve Corps, and paid a glowing tribute to the Pennsylvania troops in
                        general; and declared with emphasis that he knew no favoritism, and that he
                        utterly disregarded a brave man's politics or preferences when he gave
                        commissions. With the deepest emotion he referred to the pledges made by
                        State, when appealing to her sons to enter into the service, that she would
                        support the disabled, and provide for the families of deceased soldiers; and
                        with bitter indignation he declared that these pledges were but
                        half-redeemed, and called upon his hearers to support no man for office who
                        would not commit himself to their full redemption. In words of heartstirring
                        pathos, he pictured the maimed and sickly veteran, earning a precarious and
                        pitiful subsistence, in menial and itinerant employment, in organ-grinding
                        at street corners in our cities and the like; and he asserted that such

                    <p>We heartily approve of such societies among our late soldiers. To them they
                        are full of the purest enjoyment, and they have a tendency to keep alive a
                        martial spirit, and, nobler far, to promote a love of country which is above
                        partisan attachments, or orders of empty distinction, however ancient or
                        honorable. A rescued and grateful people will never forget their Saviors,
                        but will hand their names onward for the homage of the future. We are
                        pleased to see that our benefactors are not ready to forget themselves, and
                        are anxious to preserve under more pleasant auspices the ties of affection
                        that bound them together in the days of privation and slaughter, which yet
                        were days of glory and renown.</p>

                    <p>The all pervading disposition that manifests itself among the American people
                        to gather together in conventions for the expression and dissemination of
                        their views, is one of the peculiarities of the present age. It is the
                        unanimous acknowledgment of the increased force and power of association,
                        and in that view is an argument to prove the progress of the people in power
                        and intelligence. That it does not also establish the fact of advancement in
                        the integrity of the masses is apparent from an observation of the
                        individuals who compose some of these associations, and the ends which they
                        advocate. For example, while the brave soldiers who fought the battles of
                        the country in the late war are meeting throughout, the whole land to renew
                        their faith and re-affirm their vows of loyalty and love to their
                        Government, the highly virtuous Democracy propose a convention of those who
                        were Fort Lafayette prisoners during the war. The reader will recollect that
                        during the period Fort Lafayette was filled with traitors of every hue and
                        degree of crime. Many of its inmates had labored through the agency of the
                        Knights of the Golden Circle in the interests of the Rebellion. Some had
                        offered organized resistance to the draft. Some had burned the property of
                        Union men, and some had murdered Union citizens. But none had ever been
                        known to join the Rebel Army and fight for the South. They were too cowardly
                        for this. Their deeds were all done in darkness and in secret. Such men of
                        course necessarily belong to the Democratic party, and they but obey
                        Democratic instincts who urge upon them to assemble in convention for the
                        success of the Democratic ticket. A few weeks ago the names of several
                        thousand prisoners whom Johnson had pardoned were published. They were
                        composed of treasury thieves, counterfeiters, revenue defrauders and
                        scalewags generally, but every man of them a good Democrat. Their crimes as
                        well as their political views must necessarily endear them to the convicts
                        of Fort Lafayette. Why not join with them and swell the ranks and the power
                        of the moral Democracy? The resolutions, too, of the convention should not
                        be lost to the Democracy. With what burning words they might resolve
                        themselves into the innocent victims of an arbitrary and unconstitutional
                        despotism. How irresistibly convincing would be their declaration of the
                        superiority of the white race? How eloquently they might call upon the
                        Democracy to rescue the last flickering spark of human freedom and human
                        liberty from utter extinction, and save the world from total chaos and
                        "bustin up" of things generally. We were going to hold that the Democrats
                        south who commend Jef Davis' "incorruptible patriotism" properly belong to
                        these men, but we beg their pardon. They possess the merit of having backed
                        Jef Davis' views with their lives, and it puts them so infinitely above
                        these cowardly jail-birds that they never can reach the elevated place on
                        which they stand.</p>

                        the Democratic Convention in Alabama. The Alabama Democrats elected

                        who did this are conservative Democratic soldiers, and represent the
                        National Democracy. They will meet the delegates from Pennsylvania to

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Thursday evening last, a meeting of the Conservative soldiers of
                        Chambersburg was held in the Court House, for the purpose, as the call
                        stated, of forming a Soldiers' Club, and for the
                            further purpose of putting men in power who would honestly carry out the
                            object for which the signers of the call had taken the field. The
                        call was subscribed by 26 names, most of whom had been in the service in
                        some capacity or other, but not being able to determine from it the object
                        for which they had taken, the field, or even whose field they had taken we
                        concluded to attend the meeting and if possible ascertain. We give the
                        public the benefit of our observations. Our first impression on entering the
                        Court room was that if this exceedingly small squad of conservative
                        gentlemen had taken the field, either the field had made an indifferent
                        defense or that three years of the piping times of peace had so toned down
                        their grim war visages that it was impossible to conjecture what deeds of
                        daring they had accomplished. But the meeting was already organized, and one
                        of the immortals, the Lame Lemnian, was haranguing the really warlike but
                        apparently peaceful squad as we took our seat. For a moment, as the loud
                        tones of his powerful voice echoed through the hall, we were inclined to the
                        theory that these men took fields as Gideon and his host took the city of
                        Jericho, by blowing their horns; and involuntarily we started from out seat
                        to escape the impending doom of falling walls. But reassuring ourselves with
                        the belief that the days of miracles were over, we sat down, though with
                        blanched cheeks, and took a survey. The largest portion of the aforesaid 26
                        were in attendance, beside a score or two of little boys and about as many
                        staunch Republicans. For their encouraging presence, we thus publicly thank
                        the little boys and Republicans in the name of the 26, whose leaders, either
                        through excessive modesty or excessive fatigue from blowing, failed to do
                        so. Should they - the 26 - give another entertainment, we advise them not to
                        be offended at the apparent neglect with which they were received, but to
                        attend and take with them all their friends; only it would be well not to
                        stamp so vociferously when the name of General Grant is mentioned, for
                        though very kindly intended, this is not that kind of a meeting.</p>

                    <p>The speaker, whose infirmity ante-dates Antietam and Bull Run, made the
                        original statement that the Constitution was the Magna
                            Charta of our liberty, that Democrats and Republicans have alike
                        fought to maintain it, and that the graves of both were found scattered
                        peacefully on every hillock and in every valley throughout our whole land.
                        As if he expected some one to deny these startling propositions, he repeated
                        them several times triumphantly, but no one gain-saying them, he at length
                        seemed appeased, and proceeded to remark that the time had come when the
                        Democracy would teach the Radicals that they were as loyal to the country as
                        themselves. The small boys and the Republicans cheered this sentiment until
                        the speaker's voice was drowned, but the field-takers sat "silent as a
                        stone." It was evidently a faux pas of the
                        speaker's. He hadn't intended to say anything of the kind, and the rejoicing
                        of the Republicans that hereafter the Copperheads would be loyal, was highly
                        commendable but premature. Evidently discouraged that his tongue should take
                        such liberties with his sentiments, and somewhat confused, the orator closed
                        by informing the audience that the other eminent speakers were anxious to
                        address them.</p>

                    <p>The next and last speaker was Capt. G. W. Skinner, the youthful Paris of the
                        Democracy. After considerable hesitation, owing to the modesty so becoming
                        to youth, the Captain stated in substance that he had come to the meeting to
                        speak a piece, but that he was very badly discouraged. He expected a large
                        crowd to hear his profound views on the state of the country, while on the
                        contrary there were but few in attendance, and even among them there seemed
                        to be no disposition to listen to him. He would therefore refrain from
                        saying any thing further, and take his seat. Silence is said to give
                        consent. The silence, as the Captain took his seat, was perfectly awful.</p>

                    <p>The captain was young and inexperienced. He was unaccustomed to public
                        speaking, and had never been taught the terrible sincerity of a public
                        audience, however small. He had not counted on such hearty concurrence in
                        his idle threat to take his seat and deprive the world of his valuable
                        lucubrations. But the deed was done, and he had only himself to blame. How
                        could he mend it? He did mend it, and the skilfulness with which he did it
                        was remarkable. He arose and moved that the persons present be invited to go
                        to the speaker's desk and subscribe their names to a list for the purpose of
                        organizing a Conservative Soldiers' Club, and while urging the momentous
                        importance of the occasion, that forgetful of himself, his hearers and the
                        fact that he had sat down, he spoke his piece.</p>

                    <p>For his own sake we are constrained to say he acted neither wisely nor well
                        in talking that kind of ridiculous stuff, and his first impression not to
                        speak at all was the sound one. When a youth of twenty-two or three summers,
                        however amiable, undertakes to sit in judgment on and condemn the public
                        acts of men whose extraordinary services to the country have rendered their
                        names immortal, it is at least a folly from which his friends should have
                        saved him. If, in addition to this, he perverts history, undertakes to
                        philosophise upon governments and laws, which the wisest statesmen have
                        approached with becoming modesty, and asks foolish conundrums, he can only
                        expect to be laughed at for his pains.</p>

                    <p>Before General Grant is elected President of these United States, he should
                        at least be informed that he had better withdraw, because Capt. Skinner, of
                        Path Valley, the redoubtable Captain Skinner, twenty-three years, old has
                        pronounced him totally unqualified, and that as for him, he would never
                        allow him to assume the Presidential Chair. Why, we humbly ask, most
                            puessant Captain, have you allowed the American people to
                        honor themselves and General Grant by this unanimous nomination, only to
                        blast their cherished hopes and blight their fondest intention at this late
                        hour? But these valiant field takers, who herald their own doughy deeds with
                        their own trumpets, are gravely informed that the country will be destroyed
                        by the election of a military man to the Presidency. To prove this, it was
                        enough to recall the names of Cromwell, Napoleon the First and Napoleon the
                        Third. Just how they established this fact, the gallant Captain didn't go,
                        into the trifling particulars to show, but that they had convinced his own
                        mind we are satisfied, for the next moment he urged them to elect
                        conservative soldiers delegates to the Democratic National Convention at New
                        York, whose first and last and only duty would be to nominate a military
                        officer as the Copperhead candidate for the Presidency. But we have neither
                        time nor disposition to follow the ridiculous show further. The modesty of a
                        true soldier did not prevent the Captain's wilful and unmerited abuse of his
                        fellow soldiers, and we are sure that the man who is guilty of this is not a
                        true soldier, and that while he did fight on the side of Right and Humanity,
                        he now finds that his sympathies were with the friends of Slavery and
                        Secession.</p>

                    <p>The success of the Grant ratification meeting, of the 2d inst., had the
                        desired effect on the Spirit of last week. It is
                        very much troubled at the large attendance of Democrats, who are always
                        welcome at Radical meetings, and who enjoyed with the Republicans, the
                        truthful and eloquent remarks of the orators of the evening. By its
                        admission one-sixth were of its own party, and the remainder were Union men.
                        No wonder it becomes excited when it sees so many deserting the prejudices
                        of Copperheadism and becoming converted to the principles of the party that
                        saved the nation. It is discouraging, we admit, but that should not have
                        induced them to have indulged in the gross misrepresentations that appear in
                        certain portions of their report. Mr. Stewart, who is known as one of the
                        ablest and fairest stump speakers in this county; Mr. M'Cauley, whose unkind
                        catechism annoyed the Copperheads so much last fall, and which by request
                        will be given revised and enlargened in the coming campaign, and Col. F. S.
                        Stumbaugh, who raised two regiments in defence of the Union made telling and
                        effective speeches. They in no way alluded to the fight between the "Nigger and Dimmocrisy," for political power, for
                        the reasons that the question of negro equality, which causes many a
                        sleepless night to friends of treason and rebellion, is in no shape nor form
                        before the people. When the time comes to discuss the issue of negro
                        suffrage, when the Republican party come out openly in convention and say
                        that the African should receive the political rights he won fighting for his
                        country, then will our orators earnestly advocate and heartily support all
                        measures tending to that end. Men of ordinary capacity and intelligence
                        readily see that these appeal to the prejudices of the ignorant have no
                        longer any effect, and that they will not save the dying Copperheads from
                        their final doom at the coming elections.</p>

                    <p>But this is not what was the matter. It was the reference to the damnable
                        anti-war and treason-loving record of the Cops. They don't like it at all,
                        at all. It won't win any friends for them among the soldiers nor war
                        Democrats, they are ashamed of it, and would like to have buried it with
                        poor old ex-President Buchanan; but they couldn't, nor didn't. It is written
                        in the reports of Congress, it was made known by their orators, it was
                        advocated by their press. The people of Chambersburg and elsewhere will
                        never forget it, although they may forgive, the long faces of some of the
                        Copperhead leaders when union victories were announced, or the smiling
                        countenances of these same men when the Rebels were successful. They stand
                        as the friends of those who endeavored to force upon the country another
                        flag than that of the Stars and Stripes, and in the prophetic words of
                        Jackson in his proclamation in 1832, will be stigmatized when dead, and
                        dishonored and scorned while they live, as the authors of the first attack
                        on the Constitution of our Country. "And still adding to their infamy and
                        shame, they are now meditating the propriety of repudiating the National
                        debt," said one of our speakers. That truth was not very palatable, for some
                        of those Democrats had government bonds, and we know of three men who, upon
                        inquiry finding this to be as was stated and who patriotically invested in
                        government funds during the war, decided the next morning to vote for
                        honesty and Grant, in preference to corruption and fraud and Pendleton. It
                        is unnecessary to add that the meeting was a success, and every thing passed
                        off creditably and harmoniously.</p>
