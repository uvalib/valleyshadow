<b>Grant</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor praises General Grant and supports his nomination for President.
                    He lists Grant's achievements in the Civil War and defends his actions since the
                    war ended. He also claims that any charges of disloyalty on the part of Grant,
                    especially when compared to Democrats and President Johnson, are preposterous.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We have learned by sad experience that although the Presidential term
                        continues only four years by the calendar, it may seem to the nation from
                        the numberless evils produced by a recreant administration as many decades.
                        In other words, that the faults of our "Moses" and and not
                        ourselves, may consign us to a journeying of apparently forty years duration
                        in a wilderness of Presidential sins. We never call to mind the old
                        watchwords.<br> "Tippecanoe and Tyler too"<br> without a stinging
                        remembrance of the perfidy of the renegade successor of the honest Harrison,
                        and we no longer think of Andrew Johnson and Abraham Lincoln as standing
                        hand in hand before the people than we imagine Lucifer and Grant as friends
                        after the rebellion above the skies. We would be fools beyond hope of
                        improvement if we were not rendered more cautious in the future by the sad
                        lessons of experience of the past. We know we must place in command of our
                        forces a leader whose "trumpet gives forth no uncertain sound."</p>
                    <p>Foremost among the prominent and patriotic men proposed for the next
                        Presidency, stands Gen. Grant. A larger number of loyal voters desire to see
                        him placed at the head of the government at the next election, than wish to
                        elevate any other favorite to the position. When he and his gallant forces
                        had compelled the rebel army in the stronghold of Vicksburg to submit
                        without conditions--when throughout the land every loyal tongue re-echoed
                        the grateful praises of Gen. Grant, and the popular voice of the loyal
                        masses of the North changed the hero's name from Ulysses S. to
                        "Unconditional Surrender," in honor of his achievements along the
                        Mississippi--no true Republican questioned the patriotism of the man. When
                        Lee surrendered his shattered armies at Appomattox Court House, and every
                        loyal heart in the country was aglow in the rejoicing for the preservation
                        of the government, and with enthusiastic love for the chieftain leading the
                        armies who had humbled the traitor host; when the union soldier on the well
                        won battle-field, who had witnessed the struggle, and the wife and children
                        around the fireside at home, to whom the hurried telegrams had quickly
                        conveyed the glad tidings, each thanked God for Gen. Grant--no loyal man or
                        woman doubted the patriotism of the commander whose every laurel was
                        entwined with and inseparable from the folds of the American flag he had
                        carried to victory. Then surrounded by his brave and loyal companions in
                        arms, the patriotism of Gen. Grant was unimpeached and unimpeachable.</p>
                    <p>The scene soon changes. The assassin's bullet has done its work, and the wild
                        joy of the nation is succeeded by the unutterable sorrow and the foreboding
                        gloom which fell upon our souls when Abraham Lincoln was sacrificed. Andrew
                        Johnson apparently fills his place; fills it as the treacherous fire-damp
                        fills the place of the expelled air where the miner earns his bread or as in
                        organic changes the merciless quick-sand succeeds the solid rock. Gen. Grant
                        by virtue of his official position is thrown, per force, in in
                        constant contact with Andrew Johnson, his commander-in-chief. Influenced, no
                        doubt, by his superior officer's request, which military men generally
                        consider almost equal to a command, Gen. Grant accompanies the President to
                        the tomb of Douglas, and thus is dragged into the political stumping
                        expedition from Washington to the far West, and so was thought by some
                        persons to approve that disgraceful partizan tour, the mention of which will
                        tingle with shame the cheek of every true American for a hundred years to
                        come. The unspotted name of Grant has been blackened with even compulsive
                        contact with the detested name of Andrew Johnson.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Grant has been thought too reticent in regard to political principles
                        since the war closed, and many of us have been inclined to censure him
                        because we would have him be more outspoken for the good cause than he has
                        been. We would have him denounce the Johnson Administration in no carefully
                        measured terms. We would have him continually reiterate his implacable
                        hostility to treason and treason's friends. But are we therefore more loyal
                        than he? We must not forget the natural reticence of the man--we must
                        remember his profession, we must bear in mind the trying and difficult
                        position in which the apostasy of his commander has placed him. When Grant
                        was driving the rebel lines back further and further into the interior of
                        Virginia, when his blows fell thick and fast upon the strong defences of the
                        rebel capital; he was not always giving public vent in words to his intense
                        hatred of the enemies of the republic. Actions speak louder than words, and
                        no one then asked that Grant should be more outspoken in his sentiments with
                        reference to traitors. A soldier is taught to act more than to speak. We
                        must not forget that Grant might be able to guard the nation more
                        successfully, and to oppose the evil plans of the enemies of the country
                        since Lee's surrender more effectually, by preserving for a long time a
                        silence as to politics, than if he had come to an open rupture with the
                        Executive. There are a hundred reasons which might be given to explain why
                        Grant's course since the rebellion is consistent with loyalty. Among others
                        mark his letters to the President remonstrating against the removal of
                        Secretary Stanton and General Sheridan.--Would a traitor in deed or in heart
                        have penned those earnest appeals to Johnson's sense of right?</p>
                    <p>Grant has spoken seldom and briefly upon the civil political questions of
                        reconstruction; but when he has spoken, traitors have never been encouraged.
                        We have had proof of the weight and value of words in the vehement, blatant
                        reiteration of devotion to the union and enmity to traitors with which
                        Andrew Johnson used to regale our ears before he changed his shell. Fate
                        forbid we should measure a leader's loyalty by the
                            number of his words.</p>
                    <p>But even for the sake of argument, take the absurd position that Gen. Grant
                        has no love of country in his breast, that the stars and stripes are no more
                        than any other flag to him, that if it suited his purpose, he would as soon
                        fight with traitors, as against them. Suppose Grant is at heart as selfish
                        as the first Napoleon and as treacherous as Benedict Arnold. What motive
                        would he have for turning against the men he has led to successful conflict,
                        the flag he has carried to victory and the people who have enabled him to
                        attain a fame, peerless throughout the living world. We can well understand
                        how Andrew Johnson--disgraced by his shameful inaugural day might estimate
                        lightly his chances for becoming the Republican candidate for the
                        Presidential chair in '68, and naturally desiring to be placed in that
                        position by a larger vote than the single ballot of J. Wilkes Booth, might
                        cast about him for a party who would nominate him for the coveted place. We
                        can understand how he might hope to captivate the rebels of the South and
                        their Democratic allies of the North, and unite them in a well drilled
                        party, who might make him President next fall. His conduct is far from
                        inexplicable. How different with Gen. Grant! His laurels sit as fresh upon
                        his brow, in the eyes of a vast majority of the loyal men of the country, as
                        they did when the cannon were booming from the Atlantic to the Pacific in
                        honor of his victories. He has led a million soldiers to battle for a
                        principle, which must be a right or a wrong principle, and if a wrong
                        principle, his name is forever coupled with oppression and crime. Is it to
                        his interest to proclaim that principle false? He has fought on many a
                        bloody field where thousands of men fell that a government should be
                        preserved. Shall he rock that government to its foundations by joining its
                        enemies at home? He has carried the American flag victoriously on scenes of
                        carnage, until, while he lives, his own honor is inseparably united with the
                        honor of that banner; shall he join the ranks of those who have trailed it
                        in the dust? Imagine, for the sake of dispute--he is all ambition, all
                        selfishness--his very ambition, his very selfishness would fasten him
                        loyally to the United States government as the love of life ties the
                        shipwrecked sailor to the floating mast.</p>
                    <p>No theory leading us to doubt his loyalty, his devotion to the government
                        could stand a strict analysis or even a gleam of common sense, more than the
                        sensitive plant can bear, unchanged, the touch of the human hand. Gen. Grant
                        is the loyal people's favorite man, their strongest man and a surely true
                        and loyal man for our next Presidential term. Around him we will rally with
                        unfaltering confidence, and when the votes are counted next November, the
                        wail of traitor disappointment and dismay, and the shouts of loyal
                        exultation and gratitude welling up to Heaven will call to mind the day when
                        Lee surrendered.</p>

<b>"The M'Cardle Case"</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article comments on a Supreme Court case designed to question the
                    constitutionality of the reconstruction acts.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Peculiar interest attaches to what is generally known as the M'Cardle case,
                        now regularly docketed and ready for trial in the Supreme Court of the
                        United States. It involves the question of the constitutionality of the
                        reconstruction measures of Congress, and of the power of Congress in general
                        over the States lately in rebellion. The facts in the case are simply
                        these:--M'Cardle is a citizen of Mississippi, who was arrested and
                        imprisoned by order of Gen. Ord, late commander of the Fourth Military
                        District. The Judge sitting in that State refused an application for a writ
                        of habeas corpus in his behalf on the ground
                        that, under the reconstruction acts, he had no power to interfere.
                        M'Cardle's friends, or perhaps we should say the opponents of
                        reconstruction, are therefore determined to bring the matter before the
                        Supreme Court. They have two purposes in view in doing so, viz: to secure
                        M'Cardle's release, and to get a decision upon the constitutionality of the
                        reconstruction acts. The case came up at so late a period that its place on
                        the docket is No. 320. It cannot be reached in the ordinary course of
                        business under a couple of years.</p>
                    <p>Several weeks ago Judge Black, who is counsel for McCardle, nominally, but
                        for the entire body of anti-reconstructionists, in reality, filed a motion
                        to advance the case on the docket so that it might be argued at an early
                        day. The Court heard the arguments of counsel on this motion but have not as
                        yet decided it.--Should the motion to advance the case on the docket fail,
                        it is not likely that the case will ever again be heard of, for it is more
                        than probable that before the case can be regularly reached the question of
                        reconstruction will have determined itself. Should the motion succeed,
                        however, and the case be argued any time soon, it will have an importance
                        that cannot well be over estimated.</p>

<b>Congress</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>

                    that Congress has the nation's true interests at heart. He then lists the latest
                    laws considered by Congress to limit Johnson's power.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Congress is addressing itself right nobly to the work before it. Its
                        earnestness since the holiday vacation is refreshing, and promises
                        beneficent results. It is simply doing its duty. In some particulars it is a
                        tardy performance of that duty, but in others it is prompt, bold and decided
                        action; just what is needed, and what the country will thank it for. The
                        restoration of Secretary Stanton, was a simple act of justice, and demanded
                        not only by considerations of justice, but necessary as a denial of the
                        Executive's right to displace him; a rebuke to the former usurpation and a
                        vindication of the law. The bill requiring more than a simple majority of
                        the Supreme Court Judges to decide an Act of Congress unconstitutional, is
                        not yet a law, but surely will be after the President has had an opportunity
                        to exercise his veto prerogative. Its passage is required by the highest
                        interests of the country, and made particularly important at this time by
                        the muttered threats of those prominent in the ranks of the rebel
                        sympathizers that a majority of the Court are of the opinion that the
                        reconstruction Acts of Congress are unconstitutional. The new Reconstruction
                        Act is intended to cure the defects that experience has shown to exist in
                        the original and supplemental acts. It declares that neither the Executive
                        nor the Courts shall recognize the pretended State governments created under
                        Mr. Johnson's military proclamations as valid. The only need or aim of this
                        enactment is to deprive Mr. Johnson of a pretext for involving the country
                        in strife and bloodshed. Congress had already enacted that his pseudo State concerns were void. But he has
                        constantly manifested a desire to override, in some way, this determination
                        of Congress. To prevent any future efforts to do so, Congress makes further
                        opposition to its laws on his part so distinctly and palpably criminal that,
                        should he attempt it, impeachment would become the inevitable remedy.</p>
                    <p>The second section places the five military districts under the command of
                        Gen. Grant, but in no way disturbs the previous and necessary subordination
                        of Gen. Grant to the President, or interferes with his supremacy as
                        Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy.</p>
                    <p>The third section repeals those clauses of the Reconstruction act which
                        authorizes the President to appoint civil officers at the South, and
                        authorizes the General of the Army to appoint them.</p>
                    <p>The fourth section forbids the President to sue the Army and Navy in defense
                        of the abolished provisional governments.</p>
                    <p>The fifth section renders any person who interferes with the orders of the
                        General-in-Chief liable to punishment as for a high misdemeanor.</p>
                    <p>All this has an air of earnestness about it that inspires the loyal people of
                        the country with confidence in an early and satisfactory settlement of our
                        difficulties. This legislation has been made necessary by the factious and
                        unreasonable course of Mr. Johnson. That he will forego any opportunity he
                        may have to defeat it in its free and legal operation, we cannot doubt, but
                        let Congress continue on the alert, and persevere in its determined purpose
                        to restore the government on principles of justice and liberty, and Mr.
                        Johnson will be impotent to avert the glorious consummation of our
                    hopes.</p>

<b>The Senate</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper reports on the return of Secretary Stanton to his office by the
                    Republican Congress despite the efforts of President Johnson to remove him.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Senate, in executive, session on Monday of last week, by a vote of
                        thirty-five yeas to six nays, adopted the report of the Military Committee,
                        refusing to concur in the suspension of Secretary Stanton by the President,
                        and that gentleman on Tuesday re-entered upon the duties of his office.
                        Official notice of the action of the Senate was given to Gen. Grant, and
                        that officer immediately surrendered the War Department to Mr. Stanton, and
                        notified the President of his action. Meanwhile the President refuses to
                        recognize officially the old Secretary, whom he removed in a spirit of
                        vindictiveness, and has notified Gen. Grant, that in future all orders in
                        reference to the army, given by the Executive, will be sent to him for
                        execution. Everything relating to the War Department is in a muddle at
                        Washington, and all kinds of rumors are rife as to the future action of Mr.
                        Johnson, who is evidently in a dilemma as to the course events have taken
                        within the last few days. Even the best friends of the President acknowledge
                        that he has been checkmated. What the next move will be is not known.
                        Secretary Stanton holds undisputed possession of the office, which is said
                        he will occupy until legally removed.</p>
