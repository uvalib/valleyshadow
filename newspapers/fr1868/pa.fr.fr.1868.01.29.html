<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper severely criticizes President Johnson for vetoing the
                    Reconstruction Acts recently passed by Congress. The editors assert that his
                    actions gave power back to unreconstructed rebels, which allowed anarchy to
                    prevail in the South. The veto also forced the North to waste time coming up
                    with new Reconstruction plans instead of turning their attention to northern
                    interests.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>WE believe it is recorded in the book of Ecclesiastes, as the saying of the
                        wisest of men, "woe to thee oh land when thy king is a child." What might
                        have been the proverb of the illustrious son of David had he lived in the
                        "living present" and contemplated the ruler of our land, we know not. The
                        first minds of the nation, after much thought upon the subject, enunciated a
                        plan for the reconstruction of the Southern States; it was meet that that
                        plan should be fairly tried before setting it aside. But Andrew Johnson,
                        with the self-confidence which comes of ignorance, forgetting that "in the
                        multitude of counsellors there is safety," joined hands with the enemies of
                        the Republic to defeat the plan of Congress, by substituting a plan of his
                        own, which, although it would have the effect to restore unrepentent rebels
                        to power--he supported with all the strength of his position. It is
                        unnecessary to rehearse the despicable means he resorted to to accomplish
                        his ends. They are well known to the people, who will, when his term of
                        office is ended, consign him to a state of obscurity only equalled by that
                        which surrounds the "Sage of Wheatland." But what has been the result of
                        this opposition to Congress? If the President, instead of assuming to
                        legislate for the nation, had kept within the bounds of his office, and duly
                        executed the laws which the proper legislative bodies had devised, then the
                        disaffected people of the South would have known how to conduct themselves,
                        and instead of indulging the false hope, of attaining by means of a false
                        Executive, what they had failed to attain by the appeal to arms, they would
                        have accepted the terms offered by the conquerors, and peace and prosperity
                        would now dwell with them instead of anarchy and want. Then Congress and the
                        people of the North, instead of exciting themselves over the question "how
                        to reconstruct the South," could give their attention to the devising of
                        means to pay off the national debt and to other measures pro bono publico. Andrew Johnson is responsible for the
                        unsettled condition of things, North and South, and we would paraphrase the
                        saying of Solomon, "Woe to thee oh land when a fool is thy ruler."</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper endorses Ulysses S. Grant for the Republican nomination for
                    president. The editor admit that Salmon P. Chase would also make a good
                    candidate, but believe that Grant represents the best man in the present
                    circumstances and gives several reasons why.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>EVERY day it approaches nearer certainty that Gen. Ulysses S. Grant will be
                        the next Chief Magistrate of the Republic. For a time the great party of
                        progress was pretty nearly equally divided between two candidates. Those who
                        would provide, to a perfect certainty, against a repetition of the fatal
                        error committed in the choice of a Vice President in '64, expressed
                        themselves in favor of one who during all his life has been identified with
                        every progressive movement and who now fills with honor the most honorable
                        office in the gift of the people. Without a shadow of a doubt Salmon P.
                        Chase would represent the principles of the Radical party. Yet eminently
                        fitted as he is for the Presidency, he would not at this time have been
                        spoken of as a candidate, had we not been so utterly deceived in the present
                        incumbent. All chivalric ideas have not yet vanquished. As of old, mankind
                        delight to honor the successful warrior. And had Grant been so entirely
                        committed to Radical principles as the Chief Justice, he would have been
                        named by the unanimous voice of the Radical party. Yet, had Andrew Johnson
                        never been called to scourge the nation, no Republican would ever have
                        thought of questioning the fitness of Grant. To be sure he has not, like
                        Chase, been all his life in the vanguard of the party of progress, still it
                        was under his leadership that the greatest forward movement was made. Like
                        his competitor, he has a record which he cannot ignore. Knowing well the
                        cost of that step forward, he will not easily be persuaded to make a
                        retrograde movement. With Grant for our standard bearer, we can enter the
                        coming campaign confident of success, not only in electing him, but also in
                        restoring harmony and prosperity permanently to our country. That this may
                        speedily be accomplished is the wish of every true patriot.</p>
