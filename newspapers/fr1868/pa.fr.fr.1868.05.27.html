<b>The National Ticket</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article recounts the nomination of Grant and Colfax as the Republican
               candidates for President and Vice President then explains each of their
               qualifications, urging readers to support the pair.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
               <p>The Union National Convention met at Chicago on the 20th inst., and on the 21st
                  unanimously nominated Gen. U. S. Grant for the Presidency, and with entire harmony
                  presented Hon. Schuyler Colfax, of Indiana, and Speaker of the House of
                  Representatives, for the Vice Presidency. As was expected, Gen. Grant received the
                  unanimous vote of the Convention on the first ballot. For Vice President there
                  were five ballots cast, the last resulting in the nomination of Senator Colfax.
                  His nomination was then made unanimous.</p>

               <p>In nominating Gen. Grant, the Convention but gave formal expression to that which
                  the whole people had already decreed months ago. As he came forth at their extreme
                  need, when the imperiled country was struggling with a monster rebellion at her
                  throat, and rescued them from national murder, they now demand that he shall again
                  lead them in the approaching conflict. Never before in the history of our American
                  politics, was such undivided confidence, such unmistaken preference for any one
                  man. The soldiers were unanimous, and the politicians were of like mind.
                  California joined hands with Maine; and the Southern States, which had felt his
                  power in war, declared their faith in his ability to maintain peace. The judgment
                  of the people is right. The wild enthusiasm with which his nomination is received
                  everywhere, even when it was a foregone conclusion, proves it. Let the country
                  rejoice at the auspicious dawn of a better day.</p>

               <p>The trust of the people is well founded. Gen. Grant was ever true to his country,
                  true to his flag, and a terrible but honorable foeman to their enemies. He fought
                  that there might be lasting peace, and good will, and fraternity; not to degrade,
                  not to impoverish the people, but to restore and make happy. The reconstructed
                  South feels and knows this, and will go into the campaign with an earnestness and
                  enthusiasm that perhaps no other candidate could arouse. This nomination itself
                  will prove to be the most efficient agent to re-unite and knit together in lasting
                  peace the North and the South.</p>

               <p>Hon. Schuyler Colfax, the nominee for the Vice Presidency, has been the popular
                  and efficient Speaker of the House of Representatives since 1863, and it is
                  commonly remarked that no one has been so efficient in that difficult position
                  since it was filled by Henry Clay. He has represented his district in Congress
                  since 1854 with marked ability and fidelity, and has been in public life ever
                  since he arrived at man's estate. He, too, like so many of our best men, has
                  raised himself by his own unaided exertions from a poor and unknown boy, to be the
                  unanimous choice of the Republican party for the second gift of the American
                  people. His popularity is universal; his character for integrity and uprightness
                  is unimpeachable, and his public life, during the most bitter and tumultuous times
                  in which he has always took a bold and decided part, has never been assailed. He
                  is the type and the acknowledged leader of the young men of the Republican party.
                  His presence is sympathetic and the enthusiasm he creates is unbounded.</p>

               <p>With such standard-bearers - the first Captain of the United States, if not of the
                  world, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives - the Republican party need
                  fear no defeat. A triumphant victory in November is in their hands, and naught but
                  their folly can wrest it from them. A permanent peace, a tranquil prosperous
                  people, a bond of union wrought out of the harmonious interests of the whole
                  people, the practical and assured freedom of all classes of men, as well as the
                  abstract right to be free, and a higher type of prosperity and civilization than
                  the nation has ever yet seen, are some of the blessings guaranteed by the success
                  of this ticket.</p>

<b>Our Duty--Plain Talk</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article encourages Franklin county residents to take an active and
               committed role in the coming presidential election. The author acknowledges that

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
               <p>Now that the nominations for President and Vice President have been made, and a
                  call issued for a meeting of the Republican County Committee, it becomes the duty
                  of each individual member of the party of labor to secure its election. To labor
                  effectively to that end, every member of the party should be thoroughly in
                  earnest, and an organized system of work should be perfected by means of which the
                  efforts of each can be made most effective. Work is the great condition of success
                  in anything, and concentrated, simultaneous work is as much better than individual
                  effort, as thoroughly educated labor is better than uneducated. Enthusiasm is
                  good, but enthusiasm alone never achieved a victory. Grant pounded the Confederacy
                  to pieces by steady, long-continued, hard knocks. His declared intention "to fight
                  it out on that line, if it took all summer," is the key to unlock the secret of
                  his success in war, and the same means if intelligently and honestly employed by
                  the Republican party during the approaching campaign, will secure his election to
                  the Presidency.</p>

               <p>Franklin county is but a small portion of the great State of Pennsylvania, and the
                  merest trifle in its relation to the United States, but it is as essentially a
                  part of the great battle-field as is the city of Philadelphia and if our line be
                  broken here, it will weaken it throughout its entire length. To bring success to
                  our cause everywhere is the bounden duty of every Republican in the land, to
                  succeed here is the bounden duty of every Republican in Franklin county. How is it
                  to be done? First of all, a majority of all the votes of the county is in favor of
                  the principles of the Republican party.</p>

               <p>This is not a disputed question. Whenever a full vote of both parties is polled
                  our ticket is sure to be elected. Whenever an election fails to call out all the
                  votes our majority is greatly reduced if indeed the ticket be not defeated. We
                  must bring every Republican voter to the polls. The first step to accomplish this
                  is to make such nominations for County and Districts officers as every
                  right-minded citizen can cordially endorse. Selfish preferences and partisan
                  dictation must be discountenanced. "Rings" must be broken up and "Slates" and
                  Cliques must be abandoned. The great Republican party cannot afford to be fettered
                  and trammeled by these selfish, unpatriotic little combination in such an
                  emergency. The public good demands that the best citizens, of irreproachable
                  characters and tried Republicanism be put in nomination. Let there be a return to
                  the good old times when offices sought the men and not men the offices, and there
                  will be no reason to doubt that our whole party will unite in a common effort for
                  the success of the principles which we hold so dear.</p>

               <p>Next, let every Republican voter go to work in his own township, in this own
                  immediate neighborhood; let him counsel with his fellow Republicans and work for
                  his ticket until the interest of every loyal voter therein is thoroughly aroused
                  in its success. The voters of Franklin county are men of intelligence and sense,
                  and can be moved to act by rational causes. There is no occasion for claptrap, for
                  the exercise of cunning tricks and chicanery. The use of these will only react
                  upon the heads of those who employ them. If our principles are what we represent
                  them to be they cannot be too openly discussed nor too widely disseminated. If
                  they are not we deserve to be defeated. The mere success of the party is nothing.
                  If our success is not the triumph of Right over Wrong, of Loyalty over Treason, of
                  Truth over Error, it is not worth fighting for. That certain men should fill
                  certain offices interests no one, and rational men soon cease to concern
                  themselves in public officers if it be not for the public good.</p>

               <p>But it is not enough to strip up the flagging interest of lukewarm Republicans.
                  The warfare of truth is never a defensive one from its nature, it must always be
                  aggressive. Error and prejudice and bigotry resist. They stand on the defensive
                  and cry out "what have we to do with thee," "Let us alone."</p>

               <p>The most powerful weapons to overcome these is the Republican Press. A noble army
                  of Republican editors are spread all over the land. They are regularly enlisted
                  for the war, and fight under true colors. There are no guerrillas or bushwhackers
                  among them, who plunder or defame the dead, and outrage the living by their
                  blasphemy and obscenity. There are no Brick Pomeroy's, no New York Day Book's, no Pittsburg Post's, scavengers cowardly and merciless, who hand on the flanks of an
                  army, more to be feared than an open enemy, more to be dreaded than the Prince of
                  Darkness.</p>

               <p>In 1866 there were over eight thousand votes polled in Franklin county. It is safe
                  to predict that there will not be less than nine thousand next October. More than
                  half of these are Republicans, and should subscribe for a good Republican
                  newspaper, but the truth is scarcely more than one-fourth of them do. Here is a
                  field of energetic Republicans. Every man of any influence whatever, can procure
                  at least one neighbor, who does not now, to take his county paper, and whoever
                  does this is far more likely to make a vote for the loyal ticket of the county,
                  than he who goes about making stump speeches. Now is the time to go to work to
                  equip, and marshal, and organize our forces for the October election. If that be
                  done, and we go into battle under true and tried leaders, the honest, unbiased
                  choice of the people, success will be assured and the county will be rescued from
                  the hands of the Democracy.</p>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
               <p>The Staunton, Va., Spectator speaking for the South,
                  discourses thus on its choice of candidates to the Presidency:</p>

               <p>"So far as the South is concerned, we wish it to be distinctly understood, that we
                  have no preferences and no prejudices, in regard to men - we will sustain any
                  sound Conservative man, whether he comes from the North, the East or the West. All
                  we ask is give us the man who is strong enough to win. We go for success. What we
                  desire about all things, is a release from radical domination. The man who can
                  most certainly accomplish that end, is the man of our choice. We go for results -
                  we care not for the means, or the men who are to achieve them. We will go for
                  Pendleton, Hancock, Seymour, Hendricks, or any other good man. We indulge in no
                  narrow sectional or personal jealousies. We seek to gratify no personal
                  partialities. Victory in the coming contest is our first object. * * * We care not
                  what our candidate may think on this or that question - the great inquiry is, can
                  he win the battle? Has he the capacity to beat the radicals? In other words, does
                  he profess what John Randolph called 'the turning out faculty?'"</p>

               <p>This is truly liberal. The "Mother of Presidents" modestly waives her privilege
                  and is willing "to sustain any sound Conservative man, whether he comes from the
                  North, the East or West," only so that he can defeat the radicals. "Narrow
                  sectional or personal jealousies" are ignored. "Personal partialities" are set
                  aside, and victory alone is asked. We can't approve a policy that has no end but
                  the success of a political organization, and "cares not what a candidate may think
                  on this or that question." Still the statement is evidence of a transition state
                  in the Old Dominion which must lead to anything worse than the old "sectional
                  jealousies," and "personal partialities" which brought war and all its countless
                  woes upon the South. The list of candidates enumerated, however, is neither
                  complete nor unexceptionable, from the Spectator's own
                  stand point of "success." Pendleton is a defeated hack besides being a repudiator,
                  and all Democrats have not yet reached that exalted pinnacle where absolute
                  freedom from prejudice reigns. Hancock was once a "Lincoln hireling" and squelched
                  numerous Confederate brigades and divisions. Doolittle, unfortunately, once wore a
                  becoming Republican garment, though we confess it would illy become him now.
                  Seymour and Hendricks always opposed the war, and never were betrayed into any
                  sentimental Republican nonsense, and never were defeated candidates for the
                  Presidency. Neither have they any foolish scruples about principles. Either would
                  do well enough, if better could not be had. But better can be had. Why is not
                  Johnson's name among the list of candidates? He answers the description exactly.
                  He "goes for results," and "don't care for the means," and can adopt his thinking
                  on "this or that question" to suit any kind of circumstances. Besides, if
                  Democracy had any gratitude the party should nominate him. He has done more for
                  them than any other living man, and came nearer defeating the Radicals. He had
                  never done anything but what is mean, and therefore Democratically his character
                  is above reproach. It is true he had the misfortune to be born a "low down white,"
                  which is against him, but then he never discovered where his father was buried
                  until last summer, which should be put to his credit.</p>

               <p>Many of the journals in Virginia under the management and control of traitors, are
                  crowding their columns with denunciation of the new Constitution. They make no
                  argument against its adoption, but continually appeal to the prejudices of those
                  who have lost their fortunes and "their cause." The Richmond Enquirer of the 19th inst. goes still further, and says:</p>

               <p>"Peaceably, if possible, it shall be broken to pieces - but failing in that, let
                  us register a sacred pledge to one another that by the God of our fathers we will
                  fight it out as long as a brave arm can strike for our homes and our firesides."</p>

               <p>There were appeals of the same kind made in April, 1861, and none know better than
                  themselves the result. It creates no fear in the North to see such threats. The
                  power of the South is completely conquered, its pride has been taught a fearful
                  lesson, and its aristocracy has been destroyed. Maledictions on the work of the
                  loyal men of the Old Dominion are to be expected, and should they succeed in
                  defeating the Radical ticket, and thereby prevent the restoration of their State
                  to its place in the Union, it will be but consistent with their suicidal policy of
                  the past. Northern men, unless in large numbers, find it unsafe and unprofitable
                  to locate in the South, so long as traitors hold the reins of power, and no
                  promises from those who have so often broken their word, can induce them to think
                  otherwise. But let the Congressional plan of reconstruction be sustained by those
                  who have the true interests of their Commonwealth in view, and a new day of peace,
                  prosperity and plenty will dawn on the unrepentant followers of Lee and Davis.</p>

               </p>

               <p>During a visit of a few days to this thriving town, I find the most popular topic
                  of conversation among the people, is the projected railroad to some point where
                  they may connect with the Cumberland Valley Railroad. That it is not "all talk"
                  with them, is shown by the liberal subscriptions already made of our sixty
                  thousand dollars, and which they say will be increased to one
                     hundred thousand, for the township and borough. Committees are now out,
                  and they expect to be able to report in a few days this additional sum subscribed.
                  They have information that liberal sums have been subscribed in the other
                  townships through which the road is expected to pass, so that the question of the
                  road being made is no longer one of doubt, but a "fact" that will be realized in
                  less than two years.</p>

               <p>Under the Free railroad law, we shall soon see new lines of railways connecting
                  extreme points of our State, as well as many shorter ones coming from our rich
                  agricultural and mineral regions to form connections with these main stems, by
                  which their products may be carried to the best markets, and in return bring back
                  the many articles needed for agricultural and manufacturing purposes. The history
                  of these short roads show that they pay on the capital stock invested, develop the
                  resources of the country through which they pass, and create business at the point
                  where they connect with the main stems.</p>

               <p>Waynesboro in projecting this road, does it for her own advantage. She wishes to
                  secure an outlet for her products and facility for getting back coal and material
                  for her manufacturing establishments, which have grown up so rapidly within the
                  last few years. One of the establishments Geiser, Price &amp; Co.,
                  manufacturers of Grain Separators, employs over one hundred hands, and turn out
                  twenty five machines per week, worth from two hundred and fifty to four hundred
                  dollars a piece. Seven-eighths of all the material used in the manufacture of
                  their machines, have to be hauled from the railroad to their works by wagons, and
                  the machines when completed taken from their works to the railroad by the same
                  means of transportation, thus adding greatly to the cost of manufacture. What is
                  true of this establishment with reference to transportation is true of other
                  branches of industry carried on in the town, and on the line of the projected
                  road, not to mention the large tonnage of the Mt. Alto works, every pound of which
                  has to be transported by wagons. The road, prospectively, has been located with
                  direct reference to touching at the most important points for trade; to secure the
                  best ground plan and gradients, and the shortest distance between this borough and
                  the point most eligible to connect with the Cumberland Valley railroad. Scotland
                  has been selected thus far as that point, because it is believed the road can be
                  made at a much less cost there than to Chambersburg; and as they have made a close
                  calculation as to the amount that can be raised on the line of the road, they wish
                  to expend it to the best advantage to secure their object. So the matter becomes a
                  very plain one, so far as we are concerned. If we want the road to connect at our
                  place, it can only be secured by the active and substantial co-operation of the citizens of Chambersburg.
                  The advantages of this connection to the interests of our place were so fully and
                  forcibly set forth in the REPOSITORY of last week, that it is useless to repeat
                  them at this time. Chambersburg should be the entry port for all the principal
                  towns of Franklin county, and be connected with them by railroads. We should also
                  have a railway connection with Mercersburg, and I hope it is only a question of
                  time when all these roads will be made.</p>

               <p>It is believed by those who have estimated the probable amount of tonnage that
                  would pass over this Waynesboro branch, by the amount that is now transported by
                  wagons to and from this productive region of country, that the road would pay a
                  percent upon an expenditure of three hundred thousand dollars, the estimated cost
                  of the road to Scotland.</p>

               <p>In this and Quincy townships there are fifteen flouring mills in operation, one of
                  these mills last year shipping nine thousand, five
                  hundred barrels flour. It is estimated that the fifteen mills sent to
                  market over sixty thousand barrels of flour during the year 1867. This alone would
                  give six thousand tons of freight.</p>

               <p>Your correspondent has taken some pains to secure authentic notes upon which to
                  base the following table showing the amount of freight estimated in tons, that has
                  to be carried by the ordinary means of transportation to and from the railroad
                  from different points of the county through which it is proposed to run this road.
                  There is but one item in the table which is estimated upon the prospective demand,
                  when the road is made - and that is iron ore - any one who is familiar with the
                  character and quantity of the ore found on this route will say that seventy
                  thousand tons is a very low estimate.</p>

               <p>If we add one-third increase of freight when the road is made, then we have an
                  amount of tonnage as large as several roads of about the same length that are
                  paying six percent on over three hundred thousand dollars capital stock. I believe
                  there is not a doubt that this road, as a paying investment, will be good stock,
                  and that it will be made within two years, I am equally sure. It is for the
                  citizens of Chambersburg to determine by their action, within the next six weeks,
                  whether they will have the point of connection at their place.</p>
