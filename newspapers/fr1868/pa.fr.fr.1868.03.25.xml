                    <p>The bill proposed by Mr. Winger to appropriate $500,000 <emph rend="italic"
                            >pro rata</emph> to the losses sustained by the people of the border
                        counties during the war (excluding Chambersburg) was the special order in
                        the House on Wednesday evening last. It was discussed with much earnestness,
                        Mr. Winger speaking elaborately in support of it, and was defeated by the
                        decisive vote of 17 to 59.</p>
                    <p>Thus ends another effort to secure a recognition of these war claims, and
                        from the positive vote given, we fear that there is little hope that they
                        will ever be paid. We have ever regarded all attempts to procure partial
                        appropriations as unwise. The true policy was to present the broad issue of
                        the responsibility of the Commonwealth to its citizens for failure to
                        protect them, and we doubt not that in time the great State of Pennsylvania
                        would be just. The treasury will not warrant drafts for half a million from
                        year to year, and the public mind will grow restive under repeated and
                        unmanly applications. The appropriation to Chambersburg was a gratuity, not
                        a payment on <sic>a account</sic>. It was so urged and so given, because of
                        the immense losses that fell upon a few individuals; but the proposition to
                        pay one-fourth or one-tenth of other losses, could not but be regarded as an
                        entering wedge for the recognition and payment of the whole sum. This
                        apprehension of indefinite applications and for indefinite sums, with such
                        invitation to speculation and fraud, naturally enough startles a legislature
                        much more than would a proposition to pay the whole sum--say three
                        millions--in such time and manner as the State could afford to pay it
                        without oppressing the people.</p>
                    <p>We have for these reasons regarded Mr. Winger's bill as a grave mistake, and
                        the effort to pass it certainly leaves the claimants in a much worse
                        position than if it had not been attempted. Mr. Nicholson demonstrated
                        beyond the possibility of dispute that the treasury could not meet the
                        provisions of the bill. He showed that with the reduction of taxes already
                        made, the passage of the relief bill would leave a deficit in the treasury
                        of $384,000. It was therefore madness to insist upon the State paying the
                        money when it has not the money to pay. Had a special tax or loan been
                        authorized, the bill would have had the merit of consistency; but to propose
                        such a bill asking the treasury to do impossible things, was a folly that no
                        one should have attempted.</p>
                    <p>The people of the border who have suffered by the war, should ask the State
                        to recognize their claims in full, in such manner as may best suit the
                        commonwealth. We spend millions for defence, and no one complains. Some were
                        defended by the common expenditure.--Others were despoiled while bearing
                        arms or paying taxes to defend their fellow citizens. All, therefore, who
                        have suffered should be paid, but it must be done, if at all, in such manner
                        as not to impair the credit of the State or add seriously to the already
                        heavy burdens of the people.--The State will never pay speculators, and
                        never should; but it should, and we doubt not that it sometime will, pay the
                        honest claims of the border citizens.</p>

                <summary>The paper announces the latest defeat of a border claims bill in the
                    legislature. The editor expresses disappointment but also said the bill wouldn't
                    work because it left open the possibility of fraud and unending payments. Still,
                    he feels confident that at some point the State would take care of the damages
                    suffered by border county residents.</summary>

                    <p>
                        <emph rend="italic">To the Editors of the Franklin Repository:</emph>
                    </p>
                    <p>When the officers of a government contemplate the inauguration of a new
                        measure, of importance to the country, not the least vital consideration
                        demanding their attention, is the future good or evil example set by the
                        proposed action. To-day the first impeachment of a President of the United
                        States of America is steadily in progress, and it behooves us to consider
                        whether the influence of the precedent, which will undoubtedly be sensibly
                        felt throughout all the coming years of our republic, will be beneficial or
                        baneful.</p>
                    <p>Some of the wisest and most patriotic of our American journalists, as well as
                        some of the worst and most traitorous editors of the land, regret the
                        example of the present impeachment. More than one able editorial has
                        recently appeared, in loyal newspapers of the North, urging the necessity of
                        the impeachment, arguing that hesitancy on the part of Congress to remove
                        from office Andrew Johnson, after his last bold and defiant usurpations,
                        would stain our Congressmen with the guilt of our President, and yet
                        lamenting the necessity of the example of impeaching our Chief Magistrate.
                        Why is the example so pernicious? Why a source of regret? We are well aware
                        of the force of precedent, and we know that the doctrine, <emph
                            rend="italic">stare decisis</emph>, has too often, in all departments of
                        government been misused for oppression and wrong. Yet we are utterly unable
                        to see any danger in the example set, for subsequent years, by the
                        impeachment of Andrew Johnson.</p>
                    <p>Is it essential to the prosperity of the country, to the preservation of
                        liberty, to the vindication of law, that the impeachment clause shall, at
                        least, so far as the President is involved, remain a dead letter in our
                        Constitution? The framers of that masterpiece of political wisdom were of a
                        different opinion, or they never would have inserted those plain words in
                        the charter. Does any man conversant with the history of the times suppose,
                        the constitution ever would have accepted by the national convention, much
                        less ratified by the States, if that important check on the most trusted
                        public servant had been omitted? Is the opinion of Alexander Hamilton, as to
                        the various parts of the Constitution worth examining to-day? We do not
                        suppose it can receive much consideration either at the White House or among
                        Democratic politicians generally. Still, as the Constitution was in great
                        measure, the production of the brain of Hamilton, we may be permitted to
                        refer to his views on the subject. In comparing the powers of the King of
                        England with those of the president of the United States, that distinguished
                        Statesman dwelt upon the importance and effects of the power of impeachment
                        as follows: "The President of the United States would be liable to be
                        impeached, tried and upon conviction of treason, bribery or other high
                        crimes or misdemeanors, removed from office; and would afterwards be liable
                        to prosecution and punishment in the ordinary course of law.--The person of
                        the King of Great Britain is sacred and inviolable; there is no
                        constitutional tribunal to which he is amenable, no punishment to which he
                        can be subjected without involving the crisis of a national revolution. In
                        this delicate and important circumstance of personal responsibility, the
                        President of confederated America would stand upon no better ground than a
                        Governor of New York, and upon worse ground than the governors of Virginia
                        and Delaware." Did the man who penned those sentences consider that the
                        impeachment clause meant nothing, and was not intended to be a power in the
                        government, to be used when occasion required? Did he suppose it became
                            <emph rend="italic">functus officio</emph>, as soon as it was once
                        published throughout the land? The supposition is too absurd for argument.</p>
                    <p>But his friends tell us Andrew Johnson is being tried for <emph rend="italic"
                            >political</emph> offences, and they intimate the word <emph
                            rend="italic">political</emph> conveys all the terrible danger of the
                        precedent. We believe that Andrew Johnson is guilty of more than merely
                        political offences--but why waste time in words upon the distinction? Has
                        not the impeachment clause always been understood to include offences of a
                        purely political nature? Turn only to the opinion of the distinguished
                        lawyer, William Rawle, as printed in 1829, and we will find in a
                        justification of "the necessity or utility of impeachments" the following
                        pertinent sentences: "The delegation of important trusts, affecting the
                        higher interests of society, is always from various causes liable to abuse.
                        The fondness frequently felt for the inordinate extension of power, the
                        influence of party and of prejudice, the seductions of foreign States or the
                        baser appetite for illegitimate emolument, are sometimes productive of what
                        are not unaptly termed political offences, which it would be difficult to
                        take cognizance of in the ordinary course of judicial proceedings." Would
                        the man who held those opinions at that day have shrunk back intimidated
                        from the example of an impeachment, because the offence upon which it was
                        grounded savored of a <emph rend="italic">political</emph> nature? There is
                        not one feature in the present impeachment which is not clearly marked out
                        and provided for, in the constitution of the land, as that constitution is
                        construed and understood by its founders, and almost without an exception by
                        all the most distinguished loyal jurists of the country, from the time of
                        the constitutional Convention down to the day of Andrew Johnson's offences.
                        We have never been alarmed at the example of that clause in our American
                        magna charta. Shall we now be fearful of the example if the execution of the
                        law? Is our constitution so dangerous that we are afraid to see its
                        provisions enforced?</p>
                    <p>If the impeachment clause is a source of ruin to the government, if it lies,
                        a latent spark in our political magazine, ready when exposed to open air to
                        tear our political fabric to atoms, and rend society with civil discord and
                        lawless anarchy--let it be stricken by the legal mode from our Constitution.
                        If we dare not enforce it for fear of the example, let it not remain an
                        anomaly on the statute books of a free government, a law which we dare not
                        execute. There is no brighter gem among all the bright jewels of liberty,
                        gracing the matchless constitution of our young republic, than this same
                        impeachment proviso. It proclaims in clear and certain language, that we,
                        the people mean, no man in the United States of America however high, can
                        rise above the law. It enunciates with no ambiguous emphasis, that we are
                        governed by law alone. While one sentence of our Constitution girds the
                        sword of the nation, upon the thigh of the Chief Magistrate, the impeachment
                        salvo reminds him, that he can wield that sword only with "the strong arm of
                        the law."</p>
                    <p>No other man in the United States is clothed with so much power as the
                        President, and therefore from no other man, should we apprehend so great
                        danger of usurpation and violence, and finally despotism. The vast
                        accumulation of power in the President is certainly the weakest point we
                        have permitted in the bulwarks we have thrown around our liberties. It is
                        essential that we have a check to counteract that power, when it is turned
                        against our law. Does a false ambition lure a Chief Magistrate to
                        lawlessness and usurpation--when all ordinary tribunals are forgotten, he
                        sees, like a death's head, in his future pictures of grandeur, the stern
                        impeachment clause staring him in the face. What will be the result of the
                        example of the present impeachment? Simply to set that saving check before
                        the eyes of future Presidents, in a clearer light and a nearer position, and
                        to convince them that it is no mere mirage. Can the result be dangerous to
                        liberty?</p>
                    <p>If Andrew Johnson's last bad acts had never been perpetrated--if he had
                        stopped short of appointing Thomas to the war office, and the terrors of
                        impeachment had never been visited upon his deserving head, we might well
                        have quaked because of the precedent. If he had been permitted to crawl
                        through the remaining months of his term, a tenant by sufferance through the
                        mistaken leniency of Congress--then no future President no matter how black
                        his crimes, could ever have been impeached in our republic. The precedent of
                        Andrew Johnson with all his offences defying and escaping impeachment, would
                        have practically erased the clause from our constitution as effectually as
                        an amendment could have done. Danger from the example would have lain in
                            <emph rend="italic">not</emph> impeaching Andrew Johnson.

                <summary>"Justificus" writes the Repository with arguments for going through with
                    the impeachment of Johnson. He Insists that Congress should not shy away from
                    their duty for fear of setting a dangerous precedent. In fact, Congress would
                    leave the impeachment power of the Constitution powerless if they backed out
                    now.</summary>

                    <p>Below we give the names of the officers elected in the various townships at
                        the election on Friday last, as far as they have been received at the
                        Clerk's up to the time of going to press. The Legislature having, on
                        Thursday last, repealed the act of March, 1866, the election of borough
                        officers in Chambersburg is rendered null and void, and we go back to the
                        law in force previous to that time, requiring our municipal elections to be
                        held in May, and reducing the number of Councilmen to five and their term of
                        service to one year--all to be elected annually.</p>

                    <p>The Young Men's Christian Association of this place has been fully organized,
                        we understand, with encouraging hopes of success. At the adjourned meeting
                        held on Friday evening last, the following officers were elected for one
                        year:</p>

                    <p>We are glad to see this movement entered into so readily by the ministers and
                        members of our different churches. There is room for a good work to be
                        accomplished in our town, which the peculiar nature of a Young Men's
                        Christian Association fits it well to do, and from the earnestness with
                        which those who have organized the movement enter into the work, we believe
                        it will be done. The Association does not aim to do the work of the church,
                        for that is a work the church alone can do, but is an organized Union of
                        Christian philanthropists aiming at the religious, intellectual, and social

                    <p>To live for God and humanity should be the highest ambition of human effort.
                        To better the condition of our race, to lift fallen humanity from their sins
                        and their woes, and point them to Christ and to Heaven, is superlatively the
                        grandest and most glorious work that can engage the talents of men. To wear
                        the star of one rescued soul in the crown of the righteous, will be
                        infinitely of more value in the Great Day than to have conquered a world.</p>
                    <p>Let all who feel an interest in the welfare of the young men of our town come
                        forward in this work. The next meeting will be held in the Presbyterian
                        Lecture Room, on Friday evening, March 27th, at 7 1/2 o'clock.</p>
