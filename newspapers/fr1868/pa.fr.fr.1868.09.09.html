<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article consists entirely of attacks on the Democratic party,

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                         <p>The Democratic party is fast verging upon desperation. It aims to
                              achieve in the coming contest, what it has found, these eight years,
                              duplicity and sophistry are powerless to attain. They will, say their
                              orators, "defend nothing," but, by the impetuosity of attack will
                              essay to scale the bulwarks of opposition and gain the coveted
                              citadels of power and place. If they fulfill their promise, the change
                              of tactics will agreeably diversify our campaigns; but we fear the
                              vaunt is but an idle one. To say nothing of the difficulty a commander
                              always experiences who attempts to organize his followers, long
                              accustomed to fight under cover, taught by experience that exposure
                              invites the deadly shaft or missile, whose sorties have ever been
                              failures and irruptions disgrace, into a charging column which shall
                              sweep across the plain and mount upon ramparts lined with defenders or
                              meet in shock of conflict with close-set line, steel to steel, this
                              plan of the Democracy will be found, on trial, to be open to another
                              and more serious objection. Their arsenal is well nigh bare of weapons
                              for use in offensive as well as in defensive warfare. For years they
                              have wielded, with some effect, those which they had in their hands
                              when the war of '61 began, and have measurably recruited their stock
                              from our partial losses since, but the old ones are worn out and their
                              places cannot be supplied. In '61, the Democrats, certainly, had in
                              their hands two patent engines for mischief to Republicanism - namely
                              the presumption in favor of slavery as an existing institution
                              sanctioned by the constitution, and the inertia of eleven States
                              practically out of their relations to the Union. The alleged
                              wickedness of attacking slavery, so sanctioned, and the folly of
                              attempting to swing round again, by any human force, so huge a mass as
                              the area comprised in eleven provinces covered with unwilling people,
                              were powerful agencies for our hurt. History, it is possible, will
                              write that the Democrats made the most of them while it was time. They
                              were active, both North and South. Below Mason and Dixon, they took
                              the field with muskets and sabres and fought vindictively in aid of
                              slavery. They fought, also, to prevent the reversal, by the
                              government, of their action in separation from the Union. Above the
                              line, the Democracy, by their leaders, shrinking from the field,
                              confined their efforts to argumentation and to covert aid and comfort.
                              These leaders, essaying to diminish the effective force of the nation,
                              were zealous in their defence of slavery and unceasing in their
                              denunciations of the madness of attempting to restore the insurgent
                              territories. As subordinate to these leading aims, they discouraged
                              enlistments, they refused supplies, they magnified the debt, they
                              impugned motive and assailed character in public men, they lauded the
                              enemy by indirection when timidity forbade open praise, they covertly,
                              by counsel and material aid, crossed the line of division into the
                              realm of treason, they mourned over the successes of patriotism and
                              laughed at its defeats. These were acts of defensive warfare in truth.
                              They did much harm by them on occasions of great peril, for they,
                              measurably, succeeded in delaying the final triumph. But, in the
                              fullness of time, the triumph came, and in spite of their armed
                              attacks in one section, and their malignant, stubborn resistance in
                              the other slavery was abolished and the marvel of restoration
                              achieved.</p>

                         <p>To day, accordingly, Northern Democrats find themselves without a theme
                              for effective appeal to conservatism or despair. On the other hand,
                              our progress in the grand approach, which we are leading the world in
                              towards ultimate freedom from all bondage, both of body and mind,
                              inspires a satisfaction which incites the wish for further and greater
                              advances. Our success in accomplishing the greatest task any people
                              ever attempted encourages us to believe that, for the right, all
                              efforts will result in triumph. So it is that the Democracy, who
                              behold Slavery overthrown and rebellion defeated, find themselves
                              without arms. They are not likely therefore we think, to come out,
                              emptyhanded, and attack an enemy flushed with victory and doubly
                              armed, but if they do, the contest will be short and decisive. They
                              will defend nothing, because they will seek to leave behind what they
                              see is defenceless, and they will dash out what little of brains they
                              yet may have on the impenetrable walls of our truth-bound fortresses.</p>

                         <p>Let them come - a greater defeat than Gettysburg and a greater
                              capitulation than Appomattox await them!</p>

                         <p>Saith the Spirit, in unfolding the plan of
                              the campaign, "we will ignore the dead issues of the past." Most
                              prudent and sapient Spirit! Why dead issues? Why ignore them? Is it so very
                              long since the nation was involved in a death-struggle with slavery
                              and Democracy that the tale, more than thricetold, has become
                              wearisome, flat, stale, and unprofitable? Have the actors therein lost
                              interest in its remembrance, as well they who rose from the grapple
                              with the flush of victory on their cheeks and the light of triumph in
                              their eyes, as they, who craving mercy, were lifted up to await with
                              solicitude the victor's word which should speak their punishment or
                              their pardon? Was the strife so aimless in its conduct and so
                              fruitless in its results that it is unworthy of citation in
                              illustration either of the tendencies of policies or of the influences
                              of institutions upon the minds and consciences of men?</p>

                         <p>Were neither the characters nor the purposes of parties, in any good
                              degree, indicated by their acts and declarations during the
                              continuance of the war just closed? Is it true that, with the
                              surrender of Lee and his traitors a Appomattox, not only was the
                              strife ended but the causes of difference were so wholly buried that
                              reference to them is indiscreet and unprofitable? Above all, is it out
                              of modest shame at trumpeting forth their own good deeds in times of
                              trial, that the Democrats are unwilling to revert to the years which
                              are past, and, reviewing their annals, contemplate the scenes there
                              sketched? Charity prompts these questions. The dead past, it is
                              conceded, ought to bury its dead and the living look forward to the
                              consummation of the work which their hands find, in plenty, to do. But
                              is has never yet been taught that the past is wholly dead. The records
                              which recount the labors of the past, which hold up, as in a mirror,
                              the lives of them who struggled for and against right and truth, which
                              trace the growth of truth in the hearts of men and its approach to
                              dominance over their minds in spite of attempts to repress and to
                              extinguish it, these become lessons fit to be studied by the living.
                              They are heedless and work to certain failure who decline to read
                              them. They who do read them labor in the light of example and
                              comparison. They would do this even if it were true that the
                              generations are not co-laborers but are working independently; how
                              much more when the work of mankind is one, when father and son but
                              continue the task which the ancestor left unfinished and which their
                              posterity must in turn take up! The past is not dead nor its issues -
                              but lives in us and for us, with a vitality which alone enlivens us
                              and fits, as it enables, us to go on with the task.</p>

                         <p>They, only, ignore the past who dare not, and will not read its lessons.
                              The Spirit turns from it because it
                              convicts the party of hostility to truth, to freedom, to the lasting
                              interests of mankind. That will be a glad day to Democratic leaders -
                              if a sad one for the country - when patriots will consent to deem the
                              glory of their lifetime a thing of the past, and the aims of their
                              struggles and sacrifices only dead issues of a forgotten strife, for
                              then, we take it, and not until then, will these charlatans who seek
                              only to bewilder, to dazzle and blind, be able to gain that leadership
                              of the whole people to which they aspire.</p>

                         <p>Commander-In-Chief Wallace asks the Democracy some funny conundrums
                              which they seem very slow to answer. The fact is they have given them
                              up. He wants to know first - "Why is the National debt greater now
                              than when Lee surrendered and why does it still increase?"</p>

                         <p>The assertion that it is greater than when the war closed is false and
                              Wallace knows it, and of course the conundrum lacks point.</p>

                         <p>He asks in the second place - "What has become of the fifteen hundred
                              millions of dollars they have wrung from the comforts and necessities
                              of the people since June, 1861?"</p>

                         <p>We answer, much of it has gone to pay the debt created by a Democratic
                              war, much more to pay the interest on that debt, and the balance to
                              preserve order and protect the lives of the colored and white
                              unionists of the South against whom the Democratic party has ever
                              incited Southern rebels.</p>

                         <p>Third. "Why are more than one hundred million of dollars annually wasted
                              on the reconstructed South, and why is it not made to yield as much to
                              relieve us from taxation and aid in paying our debt?"</p>

                         <p>This is a double barrelled conundrum and we answer it as follows: So
                              much treasure has been wasted annually on the unreconstructed States
                              because the Democratic party has continually resisted the
                              reconstruction, and made its expenditure necessary to preserve peace
                              and order and provide a government for three States; and therefore it
                              could not be appropriated to paying our debt and relieving us from
                              taxation.</p>

                         <p>Fourth. "Why is the white man made the inferior of the negro in every
                              Southern State?"</p>

                         <p>Really Mr. Wallace, this is a little too hard for us. If the humiliating
                              fact be true, they can best answer for themselves. We never knew of a
                              white Union man in the South who was inferior to the negro, and it is
                              only Democrats who concede their own degradation. We know that
                              Democracy is awfully demoralizing and would not be astonished if it
                              did make its devotees really inferior to the negro.</p>

                         <p>But we would rather that Mr. Wallace answered this himself. We feel that
                              we might do injustice to the colored race.</p>

                         <p>Fifth. "Why is one class of men totally exempt from taxation whilst all
                              others groan beneath the load they should aid in bearing?"</p>

                         <p>This is also a false statement. No class of MEN is exempt. One class of
                                   property is exempt from taxation.
                              Government Bonds are exempt, so also is real estate and so also are
                              some others.</p>

                         <p>Sixth. "Why shall the 5.20 bonds be paid in gold, when by the express
                              terms of the contract they were made payable in legal tender notes?"</p>

                         <p>They were made payable in gold by the express terms of the contract, and
                              not in legal tender notes. And the best evidence of this is, that,
                              when they were created, legal tender notes were not yet in existence.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                         <p>On Saturday evening there was an immense mass meeting held at
                              Greencastle. Considering that this was the first one held there, and
                              that it was only intended to be a prelude to what is to follow, it far
                              exceeded the expectations of the most sanguine. The first exercise on
                              the programme was the presentation of a beautiful flag to the "Boys in
                              Blue" by the patriotic ladies of Greencastle. Col. Wiestling was to
                              have made the presentation, but owing to the unfortunate accident that
                              happened him he was unable to be present. Lieut. John Stewart was
                              asked to do the honors of the occasion on the part of the fair
                              presenters. Although this gentleman had no time for preparation, he
                              made an elegant little speech. W. U. Brewer then replied in behalf of
                              the Boys in Blue. After the presentation and acceptation speech, the
                              ladies sung the "Star Spangled Banner," to which the Boys in Blue
                              responded with "Rally Round the Flag." The vast crowd then swung round
                              to Zeigler's corner to listen to the orators appointed for the
                              occasion.</p>

                         <p>Mr. G. W. Zeigler was appointed chairman of the meeting. Hon. John
                              Cessna was introduced by the chairman and received with applause. He
                              spoke eloquently and pointedly for about half an hour, when owing to a
                              severe hoarseness, he was compelled to bring his remarks to a close.
                              Lieut. John Stewart was next introduced and spoke at length upon the
                              great questions before the people. He, in a very able manner, called
                              the so-called Democratic party's attention to their war record, and
                              closed by exhorting all loyal men to vindicate their loyalty by
                              supporting the Republican platform. I. H. M'Cauley, Esq., then
                              appeared and entered upon the discussion of the issues of the hour in
                              a most spirited and happy manner, and the audience showed their
                              appreciation of his remarks by their close attention.</p>

                         <p>The exercises were interspersed with music by the Chambersburg and
                              Greencastle Bands. The citizens of Greencastle are under many
                              obligations to the Chambersburg Band for the very happy manner in
                              which it entertained them, and they trust during the campaign they may
                              often have the pleasure of hearing them.</p>

                         <p>This meeting was a decided success, and showed that the Republicans are
                              fully roused up. The original intention of the meeting was that it
                              should be a sort of a commencement - an introduction only to what is
                              to follow. If this, the signal gun of the campaign, produced such a
                              decided effect, what will be the result when the heavy batteries are
                              opened all along the line?</p>
