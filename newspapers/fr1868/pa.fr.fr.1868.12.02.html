<b>Meeting of Congress</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor praises the Fortieth Congress for its efforts in bringing the
                    country back together. He outlines some of the problems Congress will face in
                    the next session, specifically providing proper governments for Virginia,

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The second session of the Fortieth Congress will meet on Monday next.--Its
                        term will be brief, expiring by constitutional limitation on the 4th of
                        March. At its close dissolves a body which sat and legislated during the
                        most complicated and critical period of our country's history, and who were
                        required to solve the greatest problems which can arise for the
                        determination of a Republican government. It was required to adjust our
                        National affairs to the new order of things evolved out of a fierce and
                        protracted civil war, wherein the vital principle of our Government was put
                        on trial, and to heal the wounds and remove the scars made by the strife.
                        Acting as the trusted servant of the people and guardian of their sacred
                        rights, its members come back fresh from their constituents with their work
                        fully endorsed and vindicated. The verdict of the people unmistakably
                        rendered at the ballot box is, well done good and faithful servants. In the
                        meter of Reconstrustion, then we take it that Congress cannot
                        fairly be expected to take a step backward, and it only remains to perfect
                        that which is not yet completed.</p>
                    <p>The assembling of Congress will be a proud occasion for the noble men who
                        return to the capital carrying with them the approval of their constituents
                        in the election of General Grant. But there are those who will not return.
                        The noblest Roman of them all sleeps in the grave. Thaddeus Stevens, mighty
                        in intellect, fearless in statesmanship, incorruptible in his life, closed
                        his eyes in death when he had beheld the principles for which he battled
                        from youth to old age made sure and irrevocable. It is no idle figure of
                        speech to say that for years the eyes of the whole country were upon him.
                        Year after year he returned to Washington and to his great work with purpose
                        unshaken and hope undimmed for the safety of the Republic. Each returning
                        session found him more and more enfeebled by age, but his heart beat with
                        all the enthusiasm of youth responsive to the call of universal Freedom and
                        universal Justice, and his mighty intellect disdained the destroying hand of
                        time. With perception almost as clear as inspiration he saw far into the
                        future, compassed the ends of treason, and more than all others thwarted its
                        efforts for civil victories when overthrown in the field. He was a ruler
                        among men by force of the mastery of his intellect; and he alone could
                        marshall the forces of Freedom and hold them in his hand to hurl them alike
                        against the spirits of treason, of ambition, of prostituted power or of weak
                        and time-serving demagogueism. He towered so high over all others
                        that none disputed his right to lead and command, as none doubted his
                        patriotism, his honesty or his philanthrophy. But he is gone and
                        we see him only through his works. He belongs to history whose unerring hand
                        will mould from these an image whose features will bear all the linaments of
                        his noble life, and place it so high that they can be seen and read by all
                        the lowly and despised of the earth for whom he lived and labored. When
                        posterity shall review the struggle of civilization and barbarism for the
                        mastery, which rocked the country to its centre, his name will be first
                        lisped by youth and linger last on the tongue of old age. Others have
                        reached higher official position than he, but their names will pass from
                        recollection while that of the friendless, unknown New England boy will grow
                        brighter so long as intelligence is a virtue and higher civilization and
                        purer laws are esteemed by the people.</p>
                    <p>But though the contemplation of Stevens' life warms the heart, it is not of
                        him we meant to write. We do not assume to predict what Congress will do,
                        and may err in our view as to what it should do for the country. Of course
                        among the first things to engage its attention will be to form a more
                        perfect Union. There are still three States, Virginia, Mississippi and
                        Texas, without representation in Congress, and without State governments,
                        having thus far refused to accept the liberal measures of the Reconstruction
                        Act provided by Congress for such States as had been in rebellion. Congress
                        will likewise, doubtless, inquire whether the State of Georgia has ever
                        ratified the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution so as to make her
                        present government a legal one, and entitle her Representatives to a seat in
                        Congress.</p>
                    <p>The Amendment was passed by a body composed largely of members who were
                        disqualified by the terms of the Amendment itself from a seat in any
                        legislature. The same body excluded thirty members of the legislature on the
                        ground that they were disqualified by the laws of the State from holding
                        office, but only after the Amendment had been passed by the votes of those
                        whom they excluded. Whether then they hold their places in the legislature
                        contrary to the Amendment or whether the colored members who gave to the
                        Amendment the requisite votes to pass it are disqualified by the State of
                        Georgia, in either event she is not in the Union, and her Government is only
                        provisional.</p>
                    <p>It becomes the duty of Congress to interfere, then, and secure to the people
                        of Georgia as to the reconstructed States a constitution which will confer
                        equal political rights on both races. Having never accepted the Amendment,
                        Georgia has neither members of the House of Representatives nor Senators.</p>
                    <p>We believe that what is yet to be done for the Southern States will be done
                        without further resistance on the part of those who are reaping the bitter
                        fruits of their own folly and madness. It is possible that those States not
                        yet admitted may give earnest assistance in restoring them to their places
                        in the Union. We trust they may; but if they still obstinately refuse, let
                        them not fail to understand that the work of Reconstruction is not finished
                        until every one of the States is restored to the Union, and that the
                        execution of the work is in the hands of Congress, who will begin the job at
                        once, and do it thoroughly. The popular verdict has so decreed it and it
                        will be done.</p>
                    <p>The financial condition of the country is such as to demand the immediate
                        attention of Congress, and all the ability of that body will be needed to
                        lessen the stringency of the money market, and enliven the stagnancy of
                        trade and industry.</p>
                    <p>The financial policy of the Secretary of the Treasury has certainly not been
                        a success, and this, together with the lack of unanimity on the part of the
                        Congress as to any given policy, and the repudiation theories of some, has
                        brought alarm and distrust and financial ruin all over the country. The
                        people look to Congress for relief. Anything which will restore confidence
                        in our finances will bring relief. Let there be honesty on the part of the
                        Government towards its creditors, and it will do more good to the country
                        than months of doubtful integrity such as has been witnessed in the
                    past.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We would call the attention of our readers to the careful perusal of the
                        supplement to this week's REPOSITORY, asking aid for the Franklin County
                        Monumental Association. There is not a man or woman in Franklin county who
                        cannot do something to encourage and assist this worthy object. To work for
                        this noble enterprise should be a pleasure; it is a duty we owe to our
                        hundreds of widows and orphans, to our heart-broken sisters and mothers, to
                        our fathers and brothers, to the patriotic comrades of those who died, to
                        the dead themselves. Let us tell posterity that those who die for their
                        country and their country's flag shall ever be remembered by a grateful
                        people. From every hamlet, township and borough brave men went forth never
                        more to return. These heroes stood as a wall of fire between our homes and
                        our foes.--We were proud of their bravery, their patriotism, their devotion
                        to liberty. Let us now erect a monument on which shall be inscribed the name
                        of every hero and soldier from Franklin county, who died that the nation
                        might live. We can do it. Let each township select men and women who will
                        work, work unceasingly until the monument is a fixed fact.--That we will
                        have one there is no doubt, but let it be such a one as will be a credit to
                        our generosity, and reflect honor on this portion of our State. We more
                        particularly appeal to our ladies throughout the county to take an interest
                        in this matter. We know what they have done in Chambersburg, and with the
                        same energy, the same determination to succeed in our towns and townships,
                        it will be but a short time ere the funds will be raised.</p>

                    <p>One of the most pleasing features of Thanksgiving Day, was the presentation
                        of a flag by Hon. C.M. Duncan to the Housum Zouaves of this borough. The
                        company was drawn up in line under command of Capt. Skinner. On presenting

                    <br>

                    <p>
                        Officers and members of this company:
                    </p>
                    <p>Some time since at our last Agricultural Fair, ballots were cast by our
                        citizens to chose a name for your company. Among the names upon the list
                        appeared my own, and the result of the election showed that my name received
                        the highest number of votes. For this unexpected and distinguished honor, I
                        am much indebted to my friends in the town and country, and embrace this
                        opportunity of returning to them my heartfelt and sincere thanks for their
                        kind partiality.</p>
                    <p>This honor, though flattering as it was and is, and grateful as I assure you
                        all I feel towards those who generously conferred it upon me; still, I now,
                        with the consent of this company, transfer it to one more deserving and
                        meritorious.</p>
                    <p>Twelve years ago when I came a stranger to this town, among the first of my
                        friends and acquaintances made here, was Col. P.B. Housum. He was then a man
                        busy in the active duties of life, with a reputation unblemished, a high
                        toned and honorable gentleman.--He was, for years, my intimate personal
                        friend.</p>
                    <p>When the civil war broke out, and our Government called for volunteers to
                        defend the integrity of the Union, among the first to leave home, with its
                        ten thousand endearments and to go forth to face a deadly foe; and alas!
                        that we have it to say, among the first to fall in the strife, was Col.
                        Housum.</p>
                    <p>For thirteen months, in active service, he escaped unharmed; but at the
                        battle of Stone River, while at the head of his column, repelling an assault
                        of Gen. Hardie's corps, he fell mortally wounded; he was borne by his
                        comrades from the field, and that night, the 31st of December, as the
                        Southern winds chanted a solemn requiem for the dying Housum. He died
                        covered with glory and his remains now fill an honored soldier's grave.
                        Though his ears are deaf to our praise, and his eyes closed to this scene,
                        and his tongue is silent still there are many who will heartily sanction the
                        tribute of respect we this pay to his memory. And it is fitting that this
                        company, composed of young men of this borough, here, where Col. Housum
                        lived and moved amongst us, and where his widow and fatherless children now
                        live, should bear his name. And I know of no one more worthy, Captain, than
                        yourself, you who shared the dangers of that day with Col. Housum, and was
                        among the first to raise him from the ground where he fell, to receive this
                        banner with his name inscribed upon it.</p>
                    <p>Let me have the honor of presenting this flag to the "Housum Zouaves."</p>
                    <p>The Star Spangled Banner needs no comments of mine. It is "known and honored
                        throughout the whole world." Its bright stars guided our forefathers through
                        the long, dark nights of the American Revolution. It cheered the hearts,
                        nerved the arms and strengthened the hands of Washington and his compatriots
                        during seven years of holy war, fighting for the independence of this
                        people, and in laboring to lay the foundations of this Republic.</p>
                    <p>It is the same Flag beneath which, in the war of 1812, the vaunted Lion of
                        old England was made to crouch the second time.</p>
                    <p>It is the same banner under which, on the unequal battlefield of Buena Vista,
                        Gen. Taylor rallied his thinned regiments, and won immortal fame; and it was
                        afterwards triumphantly unfurled in the Regal Halls of the Montezumas.</p>
                    <p>Before it paled the rebellious banner of stars and bars; and it now spreads
                        triumphantly its ample folds over the entire American people.</p>
                    <p>It is seen floating in triumph amid the ice-bound rivers and snow-clad hills
                        of Alaska, as well as in the flower-decked fields of the distant South; it
                        is found swinging gaily from the mast-heads of ten thousand vessels on the
                        Atlantic coast, and on the Pacific shores; it unfurls its Stars and Stripes,
                        above the earthquakes of the Californias. It is honored in every land, on
                        every sea, by every nation under the whole heavens.</p>
                    <p> "And long may it wave,</p>
                    <p> O'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave."</p>
                    <br>

                    <p>Capt. Skinner replied eloquently, and said:</p>
                    <br>

                    <p>MR. DUNCAN--Sir: In behalf of the members of this
                        organization, allow me to return you, the generous donor of this flag, their
                        most heartfelt thanks. Appreciating, as we do, the motives which led you to
                        lay aside an honor conferred upon yourself, and to ask that it be
                        transferred to the memory of one fallen in his country's service, we cannot,
                        nevertheless, forget on whom that honor was first bestowed. We accept, sir,
                        the flag, and the name which you have suggested, instead of your own. I
                        speak for myself, and I believe for every man in these ranks when I say that
                        no act of ours shall ever be so construed as to reflect dishonor upon the
                        name of that gallant officer which is inscribed there upon its field, or
                        upon the name of him, our honored fellow-townsman, from whose hands we have
                        just received it. It is not at all probable we will ever be called upon to
                        carry it over fields sultry with the hot breath of flying missiles, or into
                        breaches where death lurks in a thousand rifles. But I am assured were duty
                        to call us under its lead into the midst of such scenes, these men here
                        would only consent to its being trailed in the dust and dishonored when the
                        hearts that beat beneath their uniforms were still in death. We are not
                        unmindful of the fact, sir, that a national ensign can be disgraced
                        elsewhere than on the field of battle, and by other means than its cowardly
                        desertion. Men have disgraced the uniforms they wore and the flag they
                        enlisted under by ungentlemanly and dishonorable conduct at home. I trust,
                        sir, you may never have to record such conduct on the part of any member of
                        the Housum Zouaves. In listening to your eloquent and deserved tribute to
                        the memory of that gallant officer, I was reminded of the part he played in
                        the morning of that day on which he yielded up his life. How courageously he
                        bore up under the severe reverse we were then experiencing; how he urged his
                        men to stand firm in their places, and how, when the fatal bullet had laid
                        him low, with remarkable presence of mind, he called to the next officer in
                        rank to take the command which he was now relinquishing at the bidding of
                        death. In addition to what you have said, allow me, as one who served under
                        him, to bear my testimony to his personal worth. Emphatically a soldier,
                        Col. Housum was also a christian, and many of his regiment will well
                        remember his gentle reproofs when he had caught them in some sinful
                        amusement. No officer died more universally beloved by his men. The monument
                        which stands in yonder cemetery was reared by their hands, as a slight
                        manifestation of the affection they cherished toward him. Your words but
                        re-echo the feelings of our own breasts, when you express the hope that the
                        occasion will never arise for a recurrence of such scenes as many here
                        present were called on to witness a few years ago, when men in the forefront
                        were dying beneath the drooping folds of their country's flag, and loving
                        hearts around the home fireside were bursting with pain and dread. While it
                        is our hope and belief that the war will not come again upon the land, we
                        nevertheless conceive it to be the duty of every patriotic citizen to hold
                        himself in readiness to support and defend the institutions of his country
                        when endangered from any source whatever. This is the object of our
                        organization as avowed in the preamble to its constitution. Again, sir, we
                        thank you. And to you, the officers and soldiers of the Housum Zouaves, I
                        charge you to see well to the fact that the pledges I have just made, in
                        your behalf, be fulfilled, and that the proud name of Peter B. Housum be in
                        no way tarnished by its new association.</p>
                    <br>

                    <p>The company spent the day in Greencastle, where they were hospitably
                        entertained.</p>
