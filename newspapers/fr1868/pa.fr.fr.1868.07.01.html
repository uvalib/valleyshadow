               poem.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
               <p>The following eloquent extract is from the oration declared by Gen. Lemuel Todd,
                  before the Pennsylvania Reserve Association, which met recently in Pittsburg. It
                  is well worth a perusal:</p>
               <p>If one were to inquire what good results the country has gathered from three years
                  of war and expenditure of treasure and life, the answer is easy and satisfactory.
                  Questions, vital to the existence and stability of the Government, have been
                  definitely and permanently settled, and principles and institutions have been
                  eliminated from our system, which were constant sources of irritation and discord,
                  hindrance to national homogeneity, and a humiliating reproach to our professed
                  Republicanism. The problem of the durability and self-sustaining power of free,
                  popular government has been solved, and the truth demonstrated that they are
                  stronger, more flexible, and vital than any other, and better adapted to meet and
                  overcome internal troubles and convulsions. At the same time our national strength
                  and resources have been so wonderously developed as to amaze the world
                  by their magnitude, and create in the nations a profound respect for our power and
                  genius, and a wholesome dread of our hostility. Serious and economical barriers,
                  which, before separated and alienated one section of the country from the other,
                  and engendered rival animosities, fierce and turbulent in their manifestations,
                  have been swept away by the flood of progress, and no longer hinder free and
                  unrestrained intercommunication. Sectional pride and local prejudices are
                  irretrievably broken and displaced by a national, cosmopolitan spirit, that
                  joyfully secures and carries, throughout the entire area of our country, whatever
                  tends to consolidate national unity, diversify and distribute industrial pursuits,
                  promote harmony, and blend into happy and fraternal life the citizens of our now
                  regenerated land. There is no longer a North and a South in the old bitter
                  signification of the words. Emigration and capital are pouring vitalizing currents
                  of trade and activity into long neglected channels of enterprise, fusing and
                  regenerating populations, whose voices will soon blend in harmony with other
                  voices, all over our expanded territory, as they shout aloud a glad recognition of
                  the sublime axiom, "All men are created equal, and are endowed by their Creator
                  with certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." The people, having but one object
                  of national effection, will irresistably consolidate into harmonious
                  thought and action and find under the gorgeous ensigns of the Republic,' whatever
                  is 'of vital and most essential importance to public happiness.' Then man will
                  find perfect freedom and full opportunity for self development, and unlimited
                  exercise for the employment, of his noblest powers and faculties, in the pursuit
                  and acquisition of knowledge, virtue and happiness. Here, the principle of freedom
                  will permanently abide and continue to grow in strength and beauty, until the
                  whole earth is ravished with the sight of its loveliness, until all people are
                  imbued with its spirit, and indoctrinated with its teachings, and wooed into the
                  adoption of Republican institutions.</p>
               <p>Under its new and more vigorous life, our country will start on a renewed career
                  of usefulness and greatness, and furnish a boundless field for the expansion and
                  regeneration of all true social economical and governmental problems.</p>
               <p>Here all labor will be honored, softened and ameliorated. Inventive genius will
                  conquer matter and harness its lines to the chariot of industry and enterprise,
                  and by subtle and sagacious contrivances exercise the spirit of the primeval
                  curse. Agriculture will revel in the richest and most varied products.
                  Manufactures will make all our hills and valleys musical with the voices of happy
                  and contented work, and commerce will crowd in our ports and inland rivers and
                  lakes with richer cargoes than the far famed argosies of Venice ever brought home
                  to its merchant princes. Here all arts, all sciences, all literature, and all
                  culture will combine their manifold agencies in their widest scope and power to
                  make this, our country, the Canaan of the human race, and to introduce into it the
                  reign of millennial perfection. Land of our birth and love, who is able to
                  conceive of the vastness of thy future greatness and glory, or even faintly to
                  picture the boundless results that must flow from thy example and influence!</p>
               <p> Oh, fair young mother,<br> There's freedom at thy gates, and rest<br> For
                  earth's down-trodden and oppressed;<br> Power at thy bounds<br> Stops, and calls
                  back his baffled hounds.<br> On thy brow<br> Shall sit a nobler grace than
                  now,<br> Thine eye with every coming hour<br> Shall brighten, and thy form shall
                  tower<br> Deepen the brightness of thy skies,<br> The thronging years of glory
                  rise,<br> And as they fleet<br> Drop strength and riches at thy feet.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
               <p>On Saturday next, a day both memorable and sacred throughout the United States,
                  there will be gathered together in the City of New York, an immense concourse,
                  whose lives, characters, acts, and declarations, and whose time of meeting will
                  present the most contradictory episode in the history of the country. It will be
                  made up of representatives from the North and the South, the East and the West,
                  who will assemble together to nominate a candidate to represent the disloyal party
                  in the coming election. Representing as many diverse interests as there are points
                  of the compass, they have yet one and but one bond of union, the success of the
                  Democratic party, and through success secure the spoils after which they have for
                  years yearned more than ever did the Israelites after the fleshpots of Egypt.</p>
               <p>If all their diverse interests and wishes are malleable enough to be wrought into
                  an engine that can be wielded for this end alone, they may succeed in nominating
                  some one as the candidate of this mongrel party for the Presidency. But if they
                  break in pieces in the process of manipulating, they may, as in 1860, find
                  themselves with several parties and several candidates on their hands. If the
                  white man's government of one section, and the negro-voting interest of another,
                  the repudiators of one, and the bondholders of another; the original war party of
                  one, and the peace party of another, can be melted together and moulded into a
                  non-descript beast which they would entitle Availability, they may present
                  something and ask the people to vote for it against Gen. Grant; but whether it be
                  fish, flesh or fowl, a greater than Agassiz could not tell.</p>
               <p>There is a fitness in the selection of New York as the place for the cooking up of
                  this little job that should not be overlooked. Though the most populous city in
                  the United States, it is the least American in its population and sentiments, and
                  has a larger proportion of its residents made up of foreigners than any other. It
                  has a larger relative disloyal vote today, not even excluding the cities of the
                  South, than any other city in the Union, and did more to aid and encourage the
                  Rebellion. Beside this, on the 4th of July, 1863, there was a convention in New
                  York similar to that which will meet there on Saturday next. It took possession of
                  streets and rum holes just as this one will do, and in every respect was as purely
                  Democratic and as thoroughly loyal. If a nomination had been made on that occasion
                  by that murdering mob, they would with one accord have pronounced Jef Davis the
                  "purest and most incorruptable patriot," and the fitting representative of the
                  Democratic party for the Presidency, as we have no doubt that the coming one would
                  if there was the slightest hope of his election.</p>
               <p>As the first National Democratic Convention since the "recent unpleasantness," it
                  has the distinguished honor of receiving and entertaining delegates from the Sunny
                  South. Some of the refined and intelligent gentlemen--we remember them well--who
                  started to go to New York by way of the Cumberland Valley in 1863, to attend the
                  meeting of their friends on that occasion, and to replenish their wardrobes, which
                  had got a little low, will be of the number. They met with a trifling obstacle at
                  Gettysburg then, which impeded their progress so much that they concluded to
                  return without accomplishing the object of their visit. That has since been
                  removed, and as Chatham street is well stocked with cheap clothing, which
                  doubtless suit their meagre purses better than costly ones, they will certainly
                  attend. They will of course ask that the Democratic party re-affirm the doctrine
                  for which they fought and failed to win, namely: that this is a white man's
                  government, and that negroes have no rights which white men are bound to respect.
                  But if this plank is to be shifted from the platform, and one inserted upon which
                  Chase can be mounted, perhaps the seductive eloquence of Fernando Wood and Gov.
                  Seymour can prevail on them to allow the negro to vote, with this trifling
                  modification of his views, that he vote with the party who enslaved him and
                  inaugurated a rebellion to retain him in a state of slavery. Some of them, we
                  fear, may be unwilling even under the circumstances, to yield the point. For
                  example, it would be asking very much of the rebel General Forrest, one of the
                  honorable delegates, whose early education consisted chiefly in shooting at
                  "niggers," to forgo his favorite amusement, as he must do if it should so happen
                  that every time he "pulls" on a son of Ham he wipes out a Democratic voter.
                  Forrest made the crack shots of his life at Port Hudson, and will represent his
                  division of the Confederate army in the Convention, and will it be so cruel as to
                  interfere with his and their harmless sport? Put a Democratic ballot in the hands
                  of a "nigger," and it makes him altogether too valuable to be used as a mark for
                  Southern shooting-matches, and thereby discourages one of the most manly and
                  chivalrous games of the "Sunny South."</p>
               <p>Doubtless the most melting scene will be the meeting of conservative soldiers with
                  their Southern brethren, those unhappy commissioned officers who during the whole
                  war never failed to draw their pay and rations with the most commendable
                  punctuality, and only after there were no more greenbacks and rations to draw,
                  awoke to the troublesome consciousness that they had been oppressing their
                  brothers. They are "not," as the World says, "the
                  prosperous sutlers and schemers of the National army, but the battle scarred, war
                  worn veterans of the East and West." Not the men of doubtful military fame like
                  Sherman, Thomas, Sheridan, Schofield, Howard, Meade, Canby, Hooker, Burnside,
                  Logan, Palmer, Cox, Geary, Terry, Ord, Rawlings, Wilson, Fairchild, and Sickles;
                  these are friends of Grant; but such well known officers whose fame fills the
                  whole land, as Donahue, M'Quade, Maulsby, Packhurst, Gorman, Bragg, Lawrence,
                  Zatick, Allback, Dickey and M'Farland. These war-scarred veterans will join hands
                  with those of the South, and, with melting hearts and weeping eyes, again deluge
                  the Constitution, so often soaked with Democratic briny, while they confess their
                  sins and entreat the forgiveness of the Democratic Church. And well they might;
                  for if they fought at all in the Union Armies, which in case of some is very
                  doubtful, they fought against those who were striving for the supremacy of
                  Democratic doctrines.</p>

               <p>The beginning of the end has come. Arkansas is a State in full fellowship, and ere
                  our readers view these lines, the "omnibus bill," passed over Johnson's head,
                  contemptuously, will have reinstated both Carolinas, Georgia, Florida, Alabama and
                  Louisiana. Virginia, Mississippi and Texas, alone, will remain to be dealt with.
                  The absurdity of Locofoco blather about the suspension of these States from right
                  and privilege is strikingly made manifest by the recent course taken by the
                  factious minority in Congress who call themselves Democrats, and by the miserable
                  partisan who occupies, without filling, the presidential chair. For two years they
                  have been alleging in every paper they control, and have been bellowing with
                  leathern lungs on the hustings, that the Radical party was bent on subjecting the
                  late rebel Slave States to tyranny. The falsity of such assertions is now plain.
                  Against Democratic votes these States have been admitted. By admission, the
                  Congress ends this chapter of our history, and given to its own labors the unity
                  of completion. It is now apparent that not out of hate or malice--in no party
                  spirit--have these States been compelled to purge themselves of treason and
                  injustice. The interests of mankind are too high and sacred, as they depend upon
                  the well being of this republic, to permit even the risk of jeopardy by a willing
                  alliance for the second time with the slave code and secession. Who that has
                  marked the influence of institutions upon thought in this world of ruts and
                  grooves--of teaching upon a people more at the mercy of self-constituted leaders
                  than any other under the sun--can doubt, for a moment, that if the rebel States
                  had been restored, as Johnson desired, in 1865, with their iniquitous
                  constitutions and with their old-time party leaders, that the era of dissension
                  would now be only fairly beginning instead of closing? The latter state of the
                  republic would to-day be worse than the first, for more than seven devils would
                  tear and vex us. This danger the Democratic party was, as it is still, willing to
                  incur--these evils they would hail with cheerfulness, if they were only
                  accompanied by their return to power. Tis true they would promise peace, but it
                  must be the peace of re-action, of stagnation, of civil death; for, the evils, as
                  we deem them, they call good; the dangers, they esteem safety; and for equality
                  substituting caste; for uniformity of productions and identity of interests,
                  conserving diversity; for the aggressive spirit of freedom, enforcing the quietude
                  of unreasoning, unmurmuring obedience to dictation they would attain, at last,
                  through the medium of their supremacy to the dead level of changeless, unending
                  conformity to an idea. And what an idea! Remembering Democratic love for slavery,
                  these forty years and more; the countenance, for its sake, which the party gave to
                  traitors when plotting their treason; the diligence they showed, in laboring to
                  prevent the nation from offering resistance at the outset; the insane eagerness
                  with which the party hoped for the success of treason and the overthrow of the
                  Union, by means of, and during the time of, the war; the infatuation with which
                  they clung to the remains of what the war had left to survive the frame work of
                  slave institutions, and their mad appeals to the people to preserve and restore
                  them after the old model; it would be folly to doubt that their cherished design,
                  fostered into morbidity by disappointment, was, as it still is, to reconstruct as
                  the Chinese copy, with literal exactness, and to make the new a counterfeit of the
                  old.</p>
               <p>From Democratic rule and its senseless rhapsodies, the necks and the minds of the
                  people are wholly freed. The war was a rude, but an effectual emancipation; the
                  discipline of the years since the war has printed the lessons of the time
                  indelibly on the popular mind. As for success in the field, the people may thank
                  themselves because they fought the battles and won them, so for the mastery of the
                  war's lessons, they may thank themselves in the persons of their Congress, whose
                  firmness has outlasted the stubbornness of Johnson and borne down the phrensy of
                  Democratic zeal and despair. The Congress has saved us from the impracticable
                  attempt to go back to ten years ago, has delivered us from the conflict which the
                  restiveness of free ideas would have brought about had we gone back, or from the
                  peace, which, under such rule, could be derived alone from the repression of every
                  attempt at progress, aye, more, it has made possible by immediate approach, the
                  attaining of a higher plane of national greatness.--The chief drawback to our
                  progress, hitherto, has been divided counsels, and consequent paralysis of energy.
                  Free and slave labor never could and never did desire the same things or at the
                  same times. These purified states of the South are now ready and more than willing
                  to unite with the Nation in its efforts for intellectual and industrial
                  achievements. Common Schools and Pacific railroads find advocates and patrons in
                  communities which once banished the spelling book and shuddered at the sound of
                  the steam-whistle. Congress has altered these things, and, as the servant of the
                  American people, eminently deserves the thanks of all good men for doing it. Let
                  them be paid in common justice, if but as an offset to their receipt of courses
                  from the journals and the mouths of the disappointed and embittered Democracy.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
               <p>
                  To the Editors of the Franklin Repository
               </p>
               <p>The Republicans of this county must soon address themselves to the selection of a
                  candidate for Congress. In all probability the determination of the nominee of the
                  party in the district, rests with the members of the party here. It is said that
                  Somerset and Adams will vote for Mr. Koontz, and Bedford and Fulton for Mr.
                  Cessna, and that neither of the four will concede the nomination to Franklin. The
                  probable nomination of a citizen of this county for the office of additional Law
                  Judge, and the fact that the Republican candidate for Senator is claimed and seems
                  to be due here, are mentioned as reasons why the Congressional nomination should
                  go elsewhere.</p>
               <p>Some admirers here have named Col. Wiestling for the latter distinction. This
                  gentleman has certainly qualifications for the place. He was a gallant soldier in
                  the war for the Union. He is a consistent Republican and a good worker in the
                  cause. It will not be gainsayed, however, that the Colonel is a comparative
                  stranger in the county and district, and whilst there is a strong disposition to
                  concede to him everything that is his due, it is earnestly urged that the barren
                  compliment that is intended, ought rather to be given by Adjutant Stewart, Col.
                  Dixon, Major Richey, Capt. Walker, Lieut. Burgess or some other gallant soldier
                  from our midst. The writer hereof does not know that Col. Wiestling, nor either of
                  the other worthy military gentlemen named, is solicitous of the compliment
                  suggested. This fall's campaign means work, and in this close district,
                  Republicans have no time for minor matters. Compliments have their uses and do
                  well enough sometimes; but just now, when the rebel Democracy are about to make
                  one last hurculean effort to recover possession of the government, the only
                  question to be asked and answered is where and who is our best and most available
                  man?</p>
               <p>Mr. Koontz is presented by his county for renomination, upon the ground, as
                  alleged by a writer in the Somerset Herald, of special
                  availability in that section, and for the further reason that the nomination seems
                  to have gone a beging. This writer, it is presumed, was unaware of the
                  fact that Bedford county had already indicated a choice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Koontz has certainly made a creditable representative and will go into
                  retirement with the respect and good wishes of the thousands who twice voted for
                  him, and many of his political opponents. The usage of the Republican party in the
                  district is against what Mr. Koontz's friends claim for him. A third nomination to
                  an office of so great dignity and profit, has not been known for a generation,
                  except in 1862, in the case of Mr. M'Pherson, and his success was due to the
                  irreconcilable differences between the friends of Mr. King and Mr. M'Lellan. The
                  intimation in the Somerset paper that Mr. Koontz must be again a candidate to
                  bring out a full vote in that heavy Republican locality, is a libel (thoughtlessly
                  perpetrated no doubt) upon the sturdy yeomanry of that mountain region. The candid
                  editor of the Herald would surely have required his
                  correspondent to modify his communication, had that portion of it not escaped his
                  notice. The star of Republican ascendency in Somerset county has known no wane.
                  With each recurring frost, her voice is heard, audibly as the thunder among her
                  own mountains, in favor of Republican principles. Thus was it before the present
                  generation participated in politics; thus will it be in the future, so long as the
                  Almighty to accomplish his own purposes needs a Republican party. It is modestly
                  suggested that the name of General Grant ought and will accomplish as much in
                  Somerset county as that of General Koontz. In this no disparagement or disrespect
                  to the latter is intended.</p>
               <p>As has been intimated, Bedford county has presented one of her citizens for
                  Congress. His name is John Cessna. At the opening of the war a Democrat, like
                  thousands of honest and true men in that party, he turned his back on it so soon
                  as it became apparent that the organization was thoroughly committed to the cause
                  of the rebellion. In 1865, when the Republican party was dispirited, and neither
                  its friends nor its foes believed its success possible, Mr. Cessna, as Chairman of
                  the Republican State Committee, by his untiring energy, admirable management and
                  unfaltering courage, achieved a signal triumph for the cause of loyalty and truth,
                  snatching victory from the very jaws of defeat. Soon after he surprised the
                  Supreme Court by his cogent argument in favor of the act of Congress
                  disfranchising deserters. About the same time, we find him in the halls of
                  Congress at the side of Mr. Koontz in his contest with Mr. Coffroth for the seat
                  from this district. Here, aided by Mr. Koontz, he again achieved success, and
                  vindicated the rights of the loyal voters of his own and the other counties
                  concerned. During the late winter he was busily employed before the Senate at
                  Harrisburg, unearthing the fearful frauds of the Democracy, by which they caused
                  to vote, in certain localities of the State, over three thousand unnaturalized
                  foreigners, upon forged, coffee-dyed naturalization papers. Here he again
                  succeeded, and had the satisfaction of placing the rightful Senator in his seat.</p>
               <p>Will any man say that services such as these do not deserve recognition? Will any
                  man deny that John Cessna is the ablest member of the Republican party in the
                  district? Will any man allege that he will not make a splendid campaign, meeting
                  any champion or all the champions of our opponents and worsting them in public
                  discussions of the questions involved in the canvass?</p>
               <p>It is not yet known whom the Democrats will nominate. They will doubtless present
                  their best men, and do their best to win.</p>
               <p>It is the belief of hundreds of Republicans in Franklin county that their
                  nomination to Congress this fall is not only due to the Hon. John Cessna, of
                  Bedford, but that whilst with another standard-bearer, success is possible, with
                  Mr. Cessna, success is certain. FRANKLIN.</p>
