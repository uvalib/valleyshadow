<b>Democratic Lies</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper issues a long "bloody shirt" speech that blames the Democrats for
                    starting the Civil War burdened the people with heavy taxation and debt. The
                    article asserts to loyal voters that the Democrats falsely placed the blame on
                    Republicans because they had no other record to run on.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A favorite mode of the Democracy to deceive the people is to hold up before
                        them some great outrage that has been done or some onerous burden that has
                        been brought upon them, and falsely and wilfully charge the responsibility
                        of it upon the Republican party. War, always brings in its train increased
                        burdens and unsettled finances. Experience and history teach us that these
                        are its logical results. The rebellion has made our National debt enormous,
                        has given us a debased currency, and has rendered our taxes burdensome and
                        onerous. No one denies that these are the results of the war. That being
                        granted, the responsibility of the enormous debt, the debased currency and
                        the burdensome taxes rests with the party that caused the war. Our
                        proposition is now clear, and if the undisputed facts as we trace them fix
                        upon the corrupt Democracy the responsibility of the war, we shall not
                        hesitate to say that in charging these things upon the Republican party they
                        have lied, wilfully and maliciously.</p>
                    <p>When Abraham Lincoln was elected in 1860 by the Republican party, long before
                        he was inaugurated, the Southern States, one after an other, seceded from
                        the Union and began war upon the government, by seizing government forts,
                        arsenals, navy yards, mints, custom houses, &amp;c.. and stealing the
                        public money and arms within the limits of these States. They then organized
                        an independent government and prosecuted the war by besieging the garrison
                        at Fort Sumpter.</p>
                    <p>This was done by the Democratic party South. The preparation for it was made
                        by Democrats under a Democratic administration and with the aid and
                        assistance of the leaders of the Democratic party North. There was not a
                        single Republican in the entire Union who voluntarily went with the
                        rebellion, all were Democrats, every one, and they commenced a war whose end
                        was to overthrow the government and establish in its stead a government
                        "whose corner stone was to be slavery."</p>
                    <p>Because of this rebellion, the President was forced to call into the field
                        immense armies, to raise large sums of money and to sacrifice hundreds of
                        thousands of lives, and at every step of the progress of the war the efforts
                        of the loyal administration were opposed and resisted by the Democratic
                        party.</p>
                    <p>After a war of four years' duration, unparalleled for wicked cruelty and
                        bloodshed on the part of the secessionists, aided and encouraged by the
                        Democratic party, the South laid down its arms and submitted to the general
                        government.</p>
                    <p>Without stopping to count the noble lives that this Democratic war
                        sacrificed, the hundred of thousands of cripples it made, who are pensioners
                        upon the government, the helpless widows and orphans who fill the land with
                        sorrow and mourning, it imposed upon the people a debt of three thousand millions of dollars, all of which
                        was spent in saving the nation and overthrowing this gigantic Democratic
                        rebellion.</p>
                    <p>Nor must it be forgotten that in this war every man who fought against the
                        flag was a Democrat, and every man who encouraged the rebellion was a
                        Democrat, and that every Republican in the Union was on the side of the
                        government.</p>
                    <p>These are facts so patent and notorious that every one who thinks and is
                        honest knows and believes them, and it seems like an insult to one's reason
                        and understanding to urge them upon his notice.--Yet it is necessary,
                        because every Democratic journal that is published and every Democratic
                        stump speaker boldly and falsely charge the war debt and all its
                        consequences upon the Republican Party.</p>
                    <p>The enormous tax the people are forced to pay yearly is the result of the
                        rebellion, of a rebellion originated and prosecuted during four years by
                        Democrats. It is a tax to pay the interest on the National debt created by a
                        Democratic war and to pay pensions to disabled soldiers and to the widows
                        and orphans of deceased soldiers killed by Democratic rebels.--Does any
                        person who has reached man's estate not know this? And yet Democratic
                        newspapers and speakers attempt to shift the weight and responsibility of
                        this burdensome taxation, the fruit of a Democratic rebellion, upon the
                        shoulders of the Republican party, and say that it brought it upon the
                        people.</p>
                    <p>This wholesale system of lying adopted by the organs of the Copperhead
                        Democracy clearly show the extremity to which they are driven. Having no
                        record upon which they dare go before the people, their only hope is to
                        deceive the masses into the belief that their most odious acts are not their
                        own but the acts of the Republican party. We are not astonished that they
                        shrunk with fear and horror from the awful calamity they have brought upon
                        the nation, and from the overwhelming defeat that must overtake them unless
                        they can defraud the loyal voters.</p>
                    <p>In 1860 they asked the suffrages of the people to bolster up the rotten
                        system of slavery, and threatened if it were not done there would be civil
                        war. The people repudiated them and the war came. True to their threats,
                        none but Democrats upheld and fought for slavery. But it went down, and with
                        it half the Democratic thunder and all its terror. In 1864 they declared
                        that the war was a failure and was carried on for the purpose of persecuting
                        their Southern brethren, and carried the issue before the people. The loyal
                        masses repudiated them again by an overwhelming Republican victory.--Now the
                        war is over and but for Democratic hostility all the seceded States would be
                        fully restored to their former relations in the Federal Government. A third,
                        and we believe, last time they ask the people to reject the reconstruction
                        acts of Congress, to accept their oft-told lies about the authors of the
                        National debt and Federal taxes, to accept a revolutionary President and
                        Vice President, and inaugurate another civil war. They want a President who
                        will trample into dust the reconstruction acts of Congress.</p>
                    <p>It is for the loyal voters to say whether the Union is worth what it cost;
                        and if it be so they will hesitate long before they elect the candidates of
                        the present Democratic party to the head of the National Government, and
                        especially candidates who pledge themselves to overthrow the government and
                        inaugurate another rebellion.</p>

<b>Judge Kimmell Nominated</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper announces that the Democrats nominated Judge Kimmell for
                    Congress. The editors sarcastically praise the choice because in the editor's
                    view, Kimmell represents everything the Democrats will do if elected. The
                    editors especially criticize Kimmell's views on reconstruction and voting rights
                    for blacks. <br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Judg Kimmell of this town was nominated as the Democratic
                        candidate for Congress in this district on Thursday last. There was strong
                        opposition to Judge Kimmell in the conference and forty-six ballots were
                        cast before the claims of Franklin county to the candidate were admitted.</p>
                    <p>Now he is nominated and by authority of the Democratic party is made its
                        representative in this Congressional district. We are glad that this is so,
                        that the disloyal party of the country, the party that accepts the rebel
                        leaders in the late rebellion as its dictators and masters, has presented
                        him as its candidate for Congress. He is a man of far more than average
                        ability and courage, is fully up to the standard of the Democratic platform
                        made by Pendleton and Wade Hampton, and will, we firmly hope and believe, go
                        before the people of this district and ask their suffrages openly and
                        squarely upon the issue therein raised.</p>
                    <p>This would not have been so in the case of his principal opponent in the
                        conference. Mr. Myers if he had been nominated, or any one of the others,
                        could not have been regarded as the type or embodiment of the present
                        Democracy, and his election or defeat would have been neither the triumph or
                        overthrow in the district.</p>
                    <p>In Judge Kimmell, however, the Democracy have chosen perhaps, their ablest
                        and truest representative, and we may look for a contest worthy of the vital
                        principles at stake. He is bold and aggressive, and will win or fall on the
                        outer works of the party, and will scorn to steal into Congress by ingenious
                        and plausible misrepresentations of the loyalty and integrity of the
                        Democratic party. We look to see him admit the facts of the war. He could
                        not deny them if he would. We look to see him demand for rebel States and
                        Rebel men the same rights that are claimed for those who shed their blood in
                        defence of the country. We look to see him denounce the reconstruction acts
                        of Congress as unjust and unconstitutional, and claim that traitors to the
                        government have the right to say who shall be allowed the privilege of
                        citizenship in the Southern States. We shall look to see him declare that
                        his is a white man's government made for white men, and that negroes who
                        were loyal have no rights which white men, though stained with the blood of
                        loyal citizens, are bound to respect. He will be listened to with the
                        earnest attention which his ability and the gravity of the subject demands,
                        and he will be heard by an intelligent and reasoning community. While many
                        will talk without authority, and be endured, he will be expected to
                        elucidate and make clear the most momentous questions that have ever
                        agitated the American people. If he can satisfy them that the policy
                        foreshadowed by his party at the New York Convention, and boldly and
                        defiantly demanded by the most violent traitors of the South, is not fraught
                        with fearful perils to the Republic, he is possessed with more than human
                        ability.</p>
                    <p>On the part of Judge Kimmell there can be no evasion or concealment. He will
                        demand the immediate restoration of the seceded States, as that restoration
                        is explained by the Democratic candidate for Vice President, when he
                        declares "we must have a President who will execute the will of the people
                        by trampling into dust the usurpations of Congress known as the
                        reconstruction acts." He will claim for traitors, whose hands are yet
                        unwashed of the blood of loyal soldiers, not only what they spurned in the
                        Union when the South seceded, but all that they now demand through the
                        Democratic party. His prejudices against freedmen are well known, and while
                        he will scornfully pronounce them the ignorant and debased creatures who
                        have sprung from the Monkey and Chimpanzee, in one sentence, in the next he
                        will assert "that they are threatening to subordinate the proud and mighty
                        Anglo-Saxon race and bring it under the heel of the untutored African."</p>
                    <p>In short, he will strive to make the war fruitless and its results barren. He
                        will make its glorious battles mere butcheries, because fought without a
                        purpose, and will declare that our best and bravest and most patriotic
                        generals were nothing better than booted and spurred tyrants, and our
                        gallant soldiers only the abject tools of Despotism.</p>
                    <p>We do not say that Judge Kimmell will do all this as a private individual,
                        but we do say that the principles of his party which he earnestly and warmly
                        supports and advocates, if successful, could accomplish nothing short of
                        this baneful result.</p>
                    <p>Judge Kimmell will be met by Hon. John Cessna, who will go before the people
                        advocating the enlightened and christian policy of a people redeemed by
                        countless sacrifices through fire and blood. We claim him as the fearless,
                        energetic and true champion and exponent of Republican principles, who will
                        rally the faithful men of the district as one man to the cause of the right.
                        His nervous and trenchant eloquence has neither causeless war, nor slavery,
                        nor treason, nor blood to paliate or excuse. On the contrary, he can proudly
                        proclaim a rebellion defeated, a country restored, four millions of bondsmen
                        made free, and a magnanimity and charity conceded to traitors such as the
                        world has never seen before, and all this in spite of the bitter opposition
                        of the Democratic party. But he is not unaided in this contest. While
                        treason rears its head afresh in the South, and daily sacrifices new victims
                        through its hellish instruments, the Ku Klux Klan, there will be mute voices
                        in every gathering, and mute appeals at every meeting, far more eloquent
                        than the chosen champions of either party can be, who will move the hearts
                        and the honest impulses of the people with the force of a tempest against
                        the man who ignores the lessons of the war, and asks the people to blot out
                        its accomplished facts. The rebels gave us countless graves and unnumbered
                        armless sleeves and legless trousers, and grief stricken widows and orphans.
                        These cannot be removed from sight or memory, and the people will take care
                        that the others shall not be.</p>

<b>Forrest in a New Play</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper criticizes Nathan Bedford Forrest "the Fort Pillow murderer and

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A communication from a "Boy in Blue" in Greencastle, states that at the
                        adjournment of the Democratic Club in that place, the other evening, quite
                        an interesting scene was enacted. It seems the club intended to organize an
                        association under the title of the "White Boys in
                        Blue," for the benefit of Democratic soldiers. One of the "unterrified," a
                        prominent member of the club, escorted a gentleman to the club room, who
                        served the country faithfully in the capacity of a soldier during the late
                        war, and who has heretofore voted the Democratic ticket; but the rebel
                        element displayed this fall in the Democratic ranks, the material that
                        composed the New York Convention, and the choice of that Convention, has had
                        a tendency to cool his past Democratic enthusiasm. Upon looking over the
                        "immense" audience in the club room, our friend discovered men who had fired
                        on the old Flag and marched in the rebel ranks during the war. This, in
                        connection with the two or three patriotic
                        orators, was a little too heavy a dose for our friend to digest. After the
                        meeting, the members of the club remained around the entrance some minutes,
                        congratulating themselves upon the success of their cause, when our friend
                        made them a neat little speech, in which he told them, in tones sufficiently
                        loud to be heard by all passers by, that he had served in the federal army
                        during the war as a soldier for the suppression of treason and traitors,
                        that he had the same love for rebels now that he
                        had during the war, and that he discovered men in their midst that tried to
                        dismember this government and who had marched in the rebel ranks, and he
                        wanted it distinctly understood that he would never identify himself with
                        any political society or party that admitted rebels. The club displayed
                        their want of appreciation of these remarks by evaporating instantly. The
                        only persons who appreciated it, was the many Republicans who were standing
                        by and overheard it. The club can receive a large Republican audience at any
                        time by giving notice of a similar ratification of their proceedings by one
                        of its members. At the first meeting of the "Boys in Blue" after the above
                        proceeding, our friend joined his old comrades, and is now advocating and
                        defending the principle he so nobly sustained on the battle field.</p>
