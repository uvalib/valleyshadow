                <summary>The paper urges unity among Pennsylvania's Republicans during the upcoming
                    campaign. Even if Gov. Curtin is denied a vice-presidential nomination by rival
                    factions within the state, all party members should support the ticket.</summary>

                <summary>The paper claims that results show that turnout for the spring elections
                    was very small. That explains why Republicans were able to elect a judge in
                    Quincy and Democrats succeeded in Mercersburg. In Chambersburg, the Republican
                    majority stood at 20, where 200 was not uncommon. In Guilford, the Democrats
                    prevailed by only four.</summary>

                    wilderness campaign of 1864 that necessitated amputation of a portion of his
                    arm. He was removed to a hospital in Alexandria, and the operation was performed
                    there after six weeks. The bone, however, continued to decay. Two months ago,
                    Drs. Suesserott and Platt of Chambersburg amputated the remaining bone. It is
                    reported that Kegerries is almost completely recovered.</summary>
