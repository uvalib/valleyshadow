<b>The Impeachment Trial</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper reports that the impeachment trial of President Johnson will end
                    within a week, opining that the verdict will surely be "guilty" and arguing why
                    this should be the case.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The trial of Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, before the
                        highest tribunal of the government for high crimes and misdemeanors, will
                        close this week, and the verdict and judgment will be pronounced on Saturday
                        or Monday next. It cannot be complained that the accused has not had every
                        possible facility to prove his innocence or mitigate his acts. Never before
                        in a great trial has such latitude been tolerated to enable the defense to
                        build up a plausible net-work of excuses for the flagrant usurpations
                        committed by the President. His own declarations, made after the violation
                        of the rules of evidence, to make his innocence apparent if within the range
                        of possibility. He has had the ablest of counsel, the amplest time for
                        preparation, the most liberal decisions at every stage of the proceedings,
                        and now the drama is about drawing to a close.</p>

                    <p>It is noticeable that while the Democratic Senators have voted as partizans
                        on every question raised relating to impeachment, the Republicans have only
                        in rare instances voted in solid phalanx. No matter what demand the
                        President's counsel made, there were twelve votes certain to sustain it,
                        while at various stages the Senate voted against the managers who conducted
                        the prosecution. The Republican Senators have voted on questions of evidence
                        not merely in a spirit of fairness, but most liberally and even generously,
                        so that the whole truth could be given to the Senate and the country. The
                        singular spectacle was presented from the outset of a State prisoner
                        discharging the duties of the Chief Magistracy of the Union, instead of
                        being a prisoner at the bar of the court, under bonds or in custody as was
                        Senator Blunt, when he was arraigned before the same tribunal, and he was
                        allowed every channel of power to manufacture a defense for himself. On
                        Tuesday last he played his last card by the nomination of Gen. Schofield as
                        Secretary of war, in place of Stanton "to be removed," thus disowning his
                        violation of the law, and attempting to come back within the provisions of
                        the act he defied as an unconstitutional statute; but we judge that it was
                        too late to be availing. Had he made such a nomination at first, instead of
                        attempting to usurp the whole power of the government he would have escaped
                        impeachment, but in his blind frenzy to compass the restoration of
                        unrepentant traitors to power, his zeal outran both discretion and law, and
                        there was, at last, no safety for the nation but by his removal from office.</p>

                    <p>We do not care to speculate in detail as to the issue of the great trial.
                        Suffice it to say that we cannot doubt that the verdict will be "guilty."
                        There are both weak and venal men who, directly or indirectly, have some
                        power in controlling the decision, but it will be impossible for them to
                        control the number of Senators necessary to insure an acquittal. While the
                        result has not been entirely free from doubt at times, we have to-day
                        abiding faith in the final action of the Senate. Two, and possibly three,
                        Republican Senators may vote to acquit, but it does not seem to be within
                        the range of possibility to secure the votes of seven - the number necessary
                        to defeat conviction. Why there may be
                        Republican votes for acquittal is well understood in intelligent circles in
                        Washington, and it is enough for the present to say that history will not
                        accord to such votes the merit of integrity.</p>

                    <p>We await the issue with unshaken faith in a just verdict, and thenceforth the
                        long distracted nation will have peace and re union on the enduring basis of
                        freedom and justice.</p>

<b>What of the South</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article reports that in Arkansas and Louisiana, reconstruction is
                    proceeding successfully. The paper denounces resistance and violence in North
                    and South Carolina.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Of ten Southern States still unrepresented in the General Government, four,
                        Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina and Arkansas, are to-day
                        practically in the Union. Each have held elections, and adopted State
                        Constitutions, that in the main compare favorably with the best of the
                        original free States. Thus the most momentous difficulty that grew out of
                        the war, the reconstruction of the Seceded States, is being gradually but
                        surely overcome. Between the upper and nether millstones - the determination
                        of the loyal people that the principle of universal liberty must be a fact
                        as well as a theory in our Government, and the resolve of demagogues and
                        traitors both North and South that it must not - has been wrought out a
                        fitting foundation for the fairest Temple of Liberty on the earth. How much
                        the people of these States are indebted to Andrew Johnson for three years of
                        anarchy and robbery, and murder and poverty, they can best tell, for upon
                        them have they fallen unrelentingly.</p>

                    <p>Of these States Arkansas has her legislature, has elected members of the
                        House of Representatives, and two United States Senators. She is ready to
                        take her place in the Union a wiser, and, we doubt not, a better State than
                        ever before. Louisiana has adopted the Constitution submitted to her people
                        by a fair majority and is ready to take the successive steps to put her
                        alongside of Arkansas. She will loose no time in putting herself fairly in
                        the Union. South Carolina, as if in condemnation of her conduct as the
                        originator of Secession, is most emphatic in her denunciation of it now, and
                        adopts her constitution by an overwhelming majority. She is resolved that
                        there shall be no lukewarm, half-way endorsement of Reconstruction for her,
                        whatever others may do.</p>

                    <p>The returns from North Carolina, though still very imperfect, are enough to
                        show that she has rendered her verdict in favor of reconstruction. Complete
                        returns will, without doubt, show a good, fair majority. Alabama, as our
                        readers know, has also had her election but unwisely the framers of her
                        constitution provided that a majority of her registered voters should be
                        required to adopt it. Through terrorism and violence so many of her loyal
                        people were kept from the polls, that less than this number voted. Though
                        75,000 votes were cast for the constitution and less than one-tenth of this
                        number against it, she is compelled to fold her hands and wait the friendly
                        intention of Congress in her relief. There should be no hesitation on the
                        part of Congress to come to her aid. The will of the loyal people is clearly
                        manifest in the almost unanimous vote in favor of liberty, and it was never
                        contemplated that by remaining away from the polls themselves, and by
                        frightening and driving away others, the Secessionists and friends of Andrew
                        Johnson, though a hopeless minority, should keep Alabama in her present
                        anomalous condition. It is but just that she should be relieved from her
                        foes, and that right speedily.</p>

                    <p>Of the remaining States, Florida will be the first to hold an election. This
                        will be in May, and as the disaffections in the Union party have been
                        healed, she will be able to announce her emancipation from rebel dominion
                        from that date. The Impeachment trial, which will be completed before that
                        time, will doubtless have its influence upon the Florida election as well as
                        those of Mississippi and Texas and Virginia. If the President is convicted,
                        as we most firmly believe he will be, these States will loose no time in
                        putting themselves fairly and squarely on the side of the Union. There are
                        large loyal majorities in each of them, and nothing but the assistance and
                        encouragement Johnson lends the disloyal element can keep them from the
                        polls.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Our attention was called to the fact, by an article in the Harrisburg State Guard, that all the Republican papers of the
                        State, the Repository included, fail to give Jacob M. Campbell, our
                        candidate for Surveyor General, his full rank as a soldier. He entered a
                        company of the three months' volunteers, of which he was elected first
                        lieutenant, and was the officer who assisted to pitch the first tent in Camp
                        Curtin. At the expiration of the three months' service, Lieutenant Campbell
                        organized and was made Colonel of the Fifty-fourth Regiment, P. V. After
                        being in the field only a short time, Col. Campbell was ordered to the
                        command of a Brigade, which he led in many a hard fight for a year and a
                        half, retaining the confidence of his subordinate officers as a man of
                        bravery and a soldier of ability. March 13, 1865, Col. Campbell was made a
                        brevet Brigadier General. In view of the above fact, so honorable to a
                        deserving soldier, we give Brigadier General Campbell his proper rank at the
                        head of our editorial columns.</p>

                    <p>Correspondence of the Franklin Repository.</p>

                    <p>NO. XXXI.] WILKINSBURG, April 24, 1868</p>

                    <p>In reading the history of the past, nothing so impresses me as the
                        determination with which the world held to its belief in the divine right of
                        Kings. Sunday school books have taught us to wonder at the fanaticism of the
                        Hindoo mother, who throws her child to the sacred crocodiles, and to
                        contribute pennies for her enlightenment, but we are not far enough down the
                        stream of time to look back with equal horror on the persistence with which
                        the Reformers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries sacrificed
                        themselves and children to the gaping monster of kingcraft. We begin to
                        wonder at the sturdy Lutherans of the Low Countries inaugurating their great
                        revolution as beggars, for the privilege of serving their despotic King, and
                        continuing it, a half century, as beggars for a King whom they might serve;
                        and the blind devotion of the Scotch Presbyterians to the two Charles's is
                        felt to be a something requiring explanation; but the wonderful family
                        likeness of these features of "The Great Reformation," to the India
                        crocodile worship, is but very dimly discerned. Our Declaration of
                        Independence was a great projective thought cast into the future, which
                        rebounded from the hard wall of Ignorance and Superstition behind which the
                        world lies in waiting its deliverers, and fell back but little in advance of
                        its starting point. In this world the idea of the equality of men has not
                        yet formed a lodgment, and our reformers of to day, like the Netherland
                        ambassadors, go about seeking a King - some one to represent the majesty of
                        a great people - some local dignitary on whom they can look, and see the
                        reflection of a nation's power. The possible exception of a nation without
                        such focus has scarce entered into the calculations of any people on earth,
                        and until it becomes the corner stone of our national existence we can be
                        nothing better than in a transition state between Monarchy and
                        Republicanism.</p>

                    <p>Thus far our voting citizens have been political equals until one was elected
                        to an office. Then both he and those who elected him fell into a quandry as
                        to the degree in which he ceases to be one of
                        them, and how far he is all. "Who shakes me
                        shakes the Commonwealth," is a boast not confined to a hindrance in
                        executing the will of the Commonwealth, but becomes applicable to the
                        official person in his individual character. "The servant of the people" has
                        about as much significance in our language as the "the benignity of his
                        majesty" had in the court of Philip II. The servant of the people must
                        represent, in his person, the power and glory of the people; and both he and
                        they have very crude ideas of how this is to be done. English Justice is
                        represented by a gown and a wig, and Religion by a role and surplice,
                        England's power finds its focus in a petty diamond head-dress for the Queen,
                        but how shall the wealth and grandeur and prowess of the Great Republic find
                        expression, in some kind of pocket edition for convenient reference? Aye,
                        there's the question. Poor Mrs. Lincoln conscientiously believed it her duty
                        to represent her country by having prettier dresses, and more of them, than
                        any lady representative of any foreign government, and while thousands of
                        people laughed at her for her pains, they actively or silently acquiesced in
                        the common idea that our President should have a house and appointments to
                        represent the wealth and refinement of the country - that the public
                        buildings and public salaries should represent it - that our public men are
                        not as other men: but, in the reflected glory of representative honor, are
                        far removed from the common herd.</p>

                    <p>It is this dim idea of reflected glory which induces the people to tolerate
                        the expensive and grandiloquent proceedings of the impeachment trial. As a
                        Tennessee tailor Mr. Johnson could be tried and convicted, or acquitted, at
                        a public cost of one hundred dollars; but as the representative of the
                        majesty of the people, that same trial will probably cost a million. Maybe
                        some one can see how our great working population are benefited by this
                        maintenance of their dignity, but to my mind it has as little to do with
                        their welfare as Mrs. Lincoln's dress had with the comfort of the sewing
                        woman who paid taxes to buy them. Does any one suppose there will be any
                        more justice in the verdict of this expensive court than there usually is in
                        the decision of a country tribunal? Verily no, but the people either demand
                        or tolerate the ceremonies of a court. The English people must have
                        drawing-rooms and presentation dresses. The French cannot be peaceable
                        without Empirial entertainments, state coaches and Empirial nods and smiles.
                        The greatness of their estate must be represented by palaces and parades
                        while they look up from the desolate hovels to bask in the sunshine of a
                        stray glimpse of royalty, and we poor Americans, having no one royal family
                        of our own, make a little imitation of the royal accessions, and fasten them
                        upon any tailor or tinner, any rogue or honest man, whom we chance to select
                        for that particular part of the play. Then we all sit and look on, quite
                        pleased with the strange spectacle, and content to feel that we pay our part
                        in getting it up. We have a little royalty of our own, on a somewhat
                        different plan from other royalists, but on principles not altogether
                        different, and the day of the people's majesty, and of the equality of all
                        men, and a simple Republican form of Government, for the benefit of the
                        people, is yet in the dimness of the great future. When that comes, instead
                        of marble monstrosities, in which to shut public officers out from the pure
                        air of heaven, the people's servants will build school houses and asylums,
                        and justice will be as cheap for the highest as the lowest. The greatness of
                        the government will be represented by its farms and workshops, and no man
                        will carry it in his coat pocket.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Tuesday afternoon. His Honor, Judge King presided. Adam Frank, of Letterkenny
                        township, an alien, was naturalized under the act of Congress naturalizing
                        all aliens who were honorably discharged from the army. Adam arrived in this
                        country some twenty years since. He always voted with the Democracy without
                        any suspicion on the part of the Republicans that he was not entitled to a
                        vote. In 1864 Mr. Frank enlisted in the 3d Penna. Cavalry - one of the best
                        regiments that volunteered from this State. His experience satisfied him of
                        the hostility of the Northern and Southern Democracy to "Boys in Blue." He
                        returned home with his political views entirely changed, and desiring "to
                        vote as he had fought," attempted to cast his ballot for Freedom and
                        Humanity. The Copperheads being nettled by his forsaking their party,
                        challenged his vote on account of his being an alien. His vote was rejected.
                        The order of the Court, however, has created him a free American citizen,
                        and next fall his rights at the polls will be respected.</p>

                    <p>The last week of the Court was an unusually busy one for all concerned. Three

                        Term, 1865. His Honor, Judge King, left on Friday for Bedford, as he was
                        compelled to be present there on Monday of this week to preside at the
                        opening of the Court. Judge Rowe presided from Friday noon until Court
                        adjourned. A lengthy discussion took place on Friday evening in regard to
                        opening a road through Letterkenny township into Horse Valley. The President
                        Judge left his opinion with Judge Rowe, which was in favor of the road, but
                        the Associates opposed it and it was not granted. On Saturday court
                        adjourned, Judges, Lawyers and Jurors having labored faithfully for the
                        Commonwealth and her citizens.</p>
