<b>Our Seventy-Fifth Volume</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors introduce the seventy-fifth volume of the Franklin Repository.
                    They reminisce on seventy five year of events, stretching from the era of
                    Napoleon to "the patriotism and devotion and splendid heroism of the yesterdays
                    of Grant."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The Future</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors look back on the problems and trials of the previous year and
                    predict the near future. They hold that the biggest issues facing the country
                    include debt and sectional discontent, the former unjust but necessary and the
                    latter stirred up by defeated southerners. The editors also defend Republican
                    economic programs and abolition policies. The article concludes with a fearless
                    prediction that the present leaders will continue to take the country in the
                    right direction and make the land ever more prosperous.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We open the new year with this issue. We intend that it shall be, so far as
                        we are able to compass the end, a year of struggling for the triumph of our
                        principles, of contending, with greater zeal, for the establishing, finally
                        and forever, of the fundamental truths which underlie the present, as we
                        trust they ever will the future policy of our people. The beginning of a
                        year, the opening of a campaign---still more their simultaneous
                        occurrence---furnish, either of them, a fit opportunity for stating candidly
                        to ourselves, and for our own profit, the precise posture of our affairs,
                        and settling with minute determination the direction and extent of our
                        proposed adventures. Our griefs, for such is human nature, are the themes of
                        first and chief attention. Debt and sectional discontent disquiet us. The
                        effort to subdue revolt entailed the former--our success in the attempt has
                        caused the latter. It is true that we are burdened with taxes made necessary
                        by our indebtedness, and that the burden, like the rain of Heaven, falls
                        alike upon the just and unjust; and it is just as true that disaffection
                        abounds among them, who, their injustice bringing the burden, find
                        themselves enthralled by a force they cannot overcome. This debt,
                        measurably, paralyzes our energies as it devours our resources, this
                        discontent disturbs our peace insofar as it replaces coadjutors with drones
                        of reactionaries or even sulky antagonists to our plans, who, by their
                        inertia or their opposition, may endanger our security or imperil our
                        prosperity. Both are in proportions too great to admit of consideration
                        other than the most serious, both will eventually exact the wisest dealing.
                        As the magnitude of the debt plants it firmly on our shoulders for years,
                        the deep-seated causes of discontent among the Southerners will survive
                        perhaps to their children. Evils, vast and enduring, demand statesmanship
                        and it is fortunate that the elevation of thought which sacrifice coupled
                        with labor induces, can be made to continue beyond the emergency which
                        called it up. Our brief history as a nation, no more remarkable in its way,
                        till 1860, than the rise of any of the republics which have flourished in
                        their day and fallen, gained, by our entrance into a great war for the
                        defence of human rights, the second point, at last, which determined the
                        straight line of our national conduct. The statesmanship which determined
                        this defence is comparable only with that which, fixing our initial point in
                        the Declaration of Independence, indicated in its first legislation the
                        bearings of the point which we have reached. There are those who deny our
                        success in achieving it, who, unable to descry the starting place through
                        the distance of years, or unable to discern the correspondence of our
                        present place with the goal indicated on the chart our fathers gave us when
                        we set sail, doubt the identity or allege mistake. Yet we think there is no
                        doubt, that the stand-point of this people, when it assented to the
                        proclamation of universal freedom on New Year's day of 1863, and the line of
                        our advance from that date, are the goal and pathway which Jefferson, and
                        Washington, and Adams, and Franklin strove to reach, but failing, consoled
                        themselves in their future attainment and prosecution.</p>
                    <p>The fires of the war have died out--but their glowing heat is transferred to
                        the bosoms of men. The statesmanship which was equal to the occasion and
                        with rare discernment saw the true significance of events and was ready to
                        grasp the long waited opportunity, will not desert us now. The dangers of
                        imperiled credit and of seething discontent are not greater than those we
                        missed in impending dissolution or the escaping of fortune's tide-brought
                        wave unfreighted; and we are greatly mistaken if the implicit faith in
                        Providence, which, born of trial and chastening, led us to defer, in action,
                        to the commands of justice and made success possible hitherto, will not so
                        shape our policy in the future as to achieve success and safety by
                        warranting desert and favor. We conquered before by doing right, and we will
                        maintain the mastery by continuing in well-doing. So doing, we may attack
                        our evils hopefully. Luckily neither is an incurable evil. Huge as the debt
                        is, it is simply an indebtedness, nothing more. A deficiency is to be
                        replaced by assets--a vacuum to be filled in our coffers. Labor, the sole
                        source of wealth, must be fostered, increased, made more powerful. The
                        justice of emancipation reaps here its own reward, in that it substitutes
                        four millions of willing, ambitious, laborers for the same number of
                        indolent, lash-impelled, slaves. The evolving of untrammeled Northern
                        energy, giving a place to the Pacific RailRoad among its effective machines
                        and drawing the commerce of the world to our shores, is increasing our labor
                        in untold quantity and productiveness. Abolition and internal
                        improvement--twin Republican measures in the truest sense--are acts of the
                        statesmanship which, taught by the sternest master, necessity, will yet lead
                        us to stability and independence because first to freedom and homogeneity.
                        The cancellation of a debt for a free nation is the simple problem of a long
                        division, wherein the original dividend is to be set beside an ever
                        augmenting divisor. The day of our relief from taxation hastens even whilst
                        the calculation progresses, and, if we are true to ourselves, will arrest by
                        its coming the hand of the computer. For, we have no notion that the burden,
                        which over solicitous orators, who rush themselves into a fever when
                        contemplating it, desire to lessen by means as questionable in their
                        morality as injudicious in their expediency, will descend as an incumbrance
                        to our children. We have measured its bulk and our strength and have
                        reckoned on our increasing power to bear it and are satisfied with the
                        observation. The nation contracted the debt; the nation has wisely set in
                        motion the forces of the nation, by enfranchising its labor and equipping
                        it, and to it may safely look to pay its debt.</p>
                    <p>Will the same prudent statesmanship deal as successfully with our other
                        difficulty? It has sought to but has been grievously thwarted in the effort.
                        The congregations of whites who largely compose the communities in ten of
                        the areas we term States, are, by their majorities, restless and distracted.
                        They have, hitherto, successfully resisted every effort made for a
                        reconstruction of their governments in harmony alike with the national and
                        State constitutions--their reason being bewildered by prejudice and their
                        hopes inflamed by passion. Can the balance of their minds be restored--their
                        defective vision made clear and the glow of feeling lessened? We see nothing
                        hopeless in the work, if the pacificators be sagacious enough to remember
                        that, however half-taught ranters may deny it, nothing wins as nothing lasts
                        but truth and justice, and they firmly, fearlessly, follow their reforms to
                        their legitimate, logical, results. Freemen we proclaimed ourselves to be,
                        when we put our all at stake, and, appealing to the world for the rectitude
                        of our intentions, fought for and gained the independence which secured our
                        rights--freemen we were not, but liars to ourselves and to God, when we
                        bound helpless millions in chains and falsified our lives as we had damned
                        theirs--freemen we are at last, in name and in deed, when, having reft the
                        shackles from our limbs, we, with tardy justice, declare and enact that
                        liberty is an attribute of manhood as truly as life is the fight of Heaven.
                        To this we hold, and holding this, we need not despair. A policy based on
                        the truth of the equality of man must triumph; if discontent be present,
                        must pacificate; if perversion obstruct, must correct and enlighten. Such is
                        our human constitution that the right, the just, must prevail. The measures
                        which are consistent with it will recommend themselves, for they are
                        supported by that Power which gives success to the apostles who combat
                        darkness and idolatry in heathen lands and leads the theology of our era to
                        domination over all people. As a portion of His work, they will not fail,
                        but apace with Christianity, progressively approach the grand consummation
                        when as all men will be virtuous so will all men be entirely free. We do not
                        postpone however, the allaying of our sectional discord to a period so
                        remote as that at which the politician may sneeringly predict a general
                        evangelizing will occur. It is as certain, but the anticipation is a nearer
                        one. Assimilation will overcome the evil, if only the channels of absorbtion
                        and deposition be left open. The pure, fresh blood of national life will
                        soon course throughout all the veins of the body politic, and, being
                        welcomed to the diseased tissues, will renovate and restore to healthy
                        accord every morbid organ. We hope only that the wisdom which directed us
                        during the war may prove steadfast and unchanging in dealing with this
                        problem which so consequentially arises at its close.</p>
                    <p>We derive from our taking counsel with ourselves, then, these two
                        conclusions, that we have done right and been prospered by the Providence
                        which watched and sustained us, and, that if we abide in our convictions and
                        press them to their results, the issue will be our deliverance from the
                        perils which endanger our safety, and disturb our peace. In the enforcing of
                        these convictions we will be found, during the coming year, seeking to play
                        a manly part and we will confidently expect to behold as the fruits of our
                        labors, the spectacle of a unified a prosperous and a happy land.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In accordance with the notice published in a previous issue, a meeting of the
                        citizens of town and country was held in the Court House, on the evening of
                        Wednesday, December 18th, of which the Rev. Dr. Schneck was elected
                        Chairman, Col. Theodore M'Gowan Secretary. The objects of the meeting having
                        been briefly stated by the Chairman, the Rev. F.P. Stevenson, of
                        Philadelphia, was introduced to the assemblage as the orator of the evening.
                        Mr. Stevenson, in a masterly address of an hour's length, unfolded the views
                        and wishes of the organization which he represents, and of which he is an
                        officer, placing the question which he deems the vital one of the age
                        clearly before his hearers, and recommending the action, which he and they
                        desire, by a train of the most cogent argumentation. A series of resolutions
                        which have been, elsewhere, extensively adopted by similar meetings, were
                        submitted by the speaker at the close of his address as a fair and full
                        embodiment of the ideas of the agitators. Having been separately read by the
                        Secretary, the resolutions were considered by the meeting and successively
                        adopted. It was our intention to print them in this report, but they have
                        been mislaid. They were four in number: the first reciting the duty of
                        nations, as such, to formally recognize, in their charters, All mighty God
                        as the source of all authority and power in civil government. Jesus Christ
                        as the Ruler among the nations and his revealed will as of supreme
                        authority: the second enumerating the evidences afforded by our past history
                        and present position, of our failure to comply with this duty; the third
                        declaratory of an utter want of desire upon the part of the agitators to
                        prosecute this reform in a sectarian or intolerant spirit, and the last
                        affirmative of the necessity incumbent on us to remedy our neglect as soon
                        as practicable.</p>
                    <p>Upon motion it was resolved that another meeting, in continued advocacy of
                        the matter, should be called at some convenient time hereafter.</p>
