                    <p>It is impossible that any man in America should have a powerful party in the
                        country all of whose principles and doctrines coincide with his own. From
                        the nature of the human mind, such an event would be anomalous and a
                        miracle. The shades and complexions of the mind are infinite, and although
                        "history repeats itself," it never truthfully records the story of two human
                        intellects precisely alike. Yet many of us denounce the party we know to be
                        the best, and stay away from the polls, so permitting the party we most
                        condemn to triumph; because the party we favor has laid down some rule or
                        proclaimed some doctrine which we do not exactly approve. We insist that the
                        principles and views of the party shall be precisely those we individually
                        maintain, or we will withdraw our support. We shrink into our little corner
                        on election day, and weep, because we believe that politically the Godly men
                        cease from the face of the earth. We will take no part in politics when we
                        do not endorse all on either side. As well might a man find fault because no
                        large multitude of his fellow creatures are possessed of faces precisely
                        like his own. As well might he say, you are all different in your features
                        from me and I will have nothing to do with your world; and then blow out his
                        brains. He who thus voluntarily absents himself from the election and
                        deserts his own favorite party, because the principles and aims of that
                        party are not in every particular his own, destroys with his own hand his
                        own political life. Even the master mind of the determined John C. Calhoun,
                        possessing an almost immeasurable power over the intellects of so many of
                        his countrymen, was unable to produce in a long lifetime devoted mainly to
                        the one single purpose, a party which should work out successfully the
                        dogmas he instilled.</p>
                    <p>There have always been two powerful contemporaneous parties and only two
                        within the United States since the government was first established and it
                        is fair to presume there will not in the future be more than two. The
                        question for every true American to decide is not, can I induce the people
                        of the United States to act politically just as I wish? The important
                        interrogatory is which of the two great antagonistic parties of my country
                        is the best, which is the nearest right? When a man has decided this point,
                        then is it not wisest and most patriotic to adhere to and support the party
                        he has chosen as the best? A man should do all in his power to lead his
                        party nearer to what he considers the attainment of perfect political
                        excellence. But because the majority of that party are not cast in the same
                        mental and moral mould as himself, is no reason that he should abandon what
                        he knows to be the better of the two large parties and <emph rend="italic"
                            >pro tanto</emph> expose it to be conquered by the one he believes to be
                        the worse. Such highstrung autocratic, self-sufficient practices, savor more
                        of the Napoleonic "all or nothing" spirit than of the republican principles
                        of America, where the will of the majority is the law of the land.</p>
                    <p>To-day the two great parties in the field are the Republican party and the
                        Democratic party. The Republican party which has stood by the government
                        since the beginning of the rebel war, as Horatius stood by old Rome when her
                        enemies pressed close to her gates. The Republican party which has been true
                        to the old flag, true to the principles of an enlightened free government of
                        a Christian religion. The Republican party which has hurled slavery like a
                        viper from the cradle of our young Republic and warded off the traitor sword
                        which slaveholders had aimed at the Gordian knot of our Federal Union. The
                        herald of all advanced freedom and justice and morality on earth since
                        Christ ascended from among men. The Democratic party. Lucifer lend us words
                        to describe it. The party which attempted to destroy the government
                        Washington founded.--The modern champions of human slavery. The advocates of
                        treason in the United States. The party which murdered hundreds of thousands
                        of Americans because they were marshalled to maintain the Union of the
                        States. The assassins of Abraham Lincoln. The fawning flatterers and pliant
                        tools of Andrew Johnson. The blackest manifestation of all the retrograde
                        doctrines of the American slaveholder. The advanced guard of all that is
                        unjust and enslaving and treasonable and murderous on earth.</p>
                    <p>These two parties stand before each American citizen. Aid one of them
                        directly or indirectly he must. Let him choose between them and then fight
                        earnestly in the ranks of the one he has chosen.</p>
                    <p>We have long sneered at Democrats as slaves to party, because, we say, they
                        would vote for the Devil were he a Democratic candidate. So they would, and
                        if there is one right principle left in the rotten platform of that
                        mouldering organization, it is the principle that a man should through thick
                        and thin stand by the nominees of the party he believes to be the best. Let
                        us not be too haughty to learn a good lesson even from our enemies.</p>

                    <p>Since the opening of the present session of Congress, the difficulties in the
                        way of reconstruction upon republican principles have been legion; and the
                        main issues, together with the side issues connected with the finances and
                        other important public measures, have been almost interminable. The
                        hostility of the rebel leaders in the South to anything like a fair
                        adjustment of their relations with the Union; the removal by the President,
                        of such officers as were willing to execute the laws of Congress, and the
                        substitution of such men as would take the old Rebel State laws as their
                        guide; the scheme concocted by Andrew Johnson and the leaders of the
                        Democratic Party, to pit the Supreme Court against the Congressional plan of
                        reconstruction, these we say were some of the discouraging features of our
                        political situation.</p>
                    <p>To render the prospect still more unpromising, the members of the Republican
                        Party in Congress had been somewhat at variance among themselves upon many
                        important measures, and no settled policy seemed even to be indicated by
                        them as the one by which to counteract all these adverse influences. Union
                        men from the South were writing and sending delegations to impress upon
                        others their conviction, that unless further help were afforded them, the
                        work of reconstruction would certainly prove an entire failure. Sheridan,
                        Pope, Swayne and other faithful officers had been set aside, and Hancock
                        with his original States' rights policy was placed at the head of affairs in
                        the principle Military District of the South. The President and Jerry Black
                        were working with might and main to interpose the Supreme Court, in the
                        defeat of Stanton's re-instatement, so that the military power might remain
                        in harmonious tact from the Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, down to
                        the lowest officer engaged in the task of reconstruction.</p>
                    <p>This fierce and threatening aspect of the opposing elements, happily have had
                        the effect of putting a stop to the petty dissensions and wranglings in the
                        Republican ranks, and the great loyal party in Congress is beginning to
                        crystalize into regular, solid forms <sic>in regard the essentials.</sic>
                        The replacing of Stanton in his old situation as Secretary of War, by a
                        strictly party vote in the Senate, was effected with such neatness and
                        dispatch as to surprise the presidential party, and entirely to overthrow
                        their best laid plans. But as we remarked before, from a feeling that the
                        Republican law-makers were about to become defeated, or demoralized, there
                        is now springing up a sense of strength, integrity and self-reliance among
                        them which always bodes victory.</p>
                    <p>On the same day that the Senate reinstated Stanton, the bill proposing to
                        regulate the Supreme Court was reported in the House by the Judiciary
                        Committee--a bill requiring a majority of two-thirds of that Court against a
                        law of Congress, in order to render its decision of unconstitutionality
                        valid. To render the coincidents of the day still more remarkable,
                        immediately in the wake of this report of the Judiciary Committee, and in
                        the regular order of business, the new reconstruction bill was introduced;
                        and in the various test ballotings held on all these measures, the old party
                        lines were clearly drawn, and everything had gotten into its proper channel.
                        The Republican ship was putting out before the breeze with steady rudder and
                        taut rigging, in every respect ready for the coming storm.</p>
                    <p>This mere exhibition of its real strength, has rendered the party buoyant and
                        hopeful, so much so as to make some doubt now the necessity of exerting all
                        its power in the direction contemplated--seeing the opposition so completely
                        baffled and humiliated. In the meantime some things have transpired to
                        induce the belief that the Supreme Court, although admitting the cases
                        testing the validity of the reconstruction laws to a hearing, will most
                        likely then dismiss them as not coming within their jurisdiction.</p>
                    <p>Congress has, by large majorities in both Houses, quieted the fears of
                        further contraction of the currency by ending the power hitherto resting
                        with the Secretary of the Treasury, to manipulate this delicate business at
                        will. The cheerful political <sic>pospect</sic> is not alone, or not so much
                        perhaps on account of the legislative acts which have been completed, but in
                        good earnest at Washington. The noble Fortieth Congress is rapidly becoming
                        masters of the situation; and having done its work well, the rank and file
                        will follow it in working for the right during the whole campaign of 1868,
                        until the final act at the ballot-box in November next.</p>

                    <p>The Democrats are organising everywhere, and exerting themselves to the
                        utmost, to be prepared to carry the spring elections, and get the election
                        officers in as many districts as possible. Their State Committee has called
                        attention to this <sic>subjct</sic>, and their County Committees and
                        prominent politicians every where are busily engaged making the necessary
                        arrangements. The activity of the enemy should arouse every earnest
                        Republican to the necessity of attending to this most important matter. In
                        every district they should exert themselves to the utmost, above all other
                        things, to elect trusty and capable election officers, and to bring out in
                        this preliminary engagement the full strength of the Republican party. There
                        is not the slightest question that a desperate effort will be made by the
                        Democrats and their rebel allies to carry the Congressional and Presidential
                        tickets next fall. To accomplish this, they will be willing to resort to any
                        measure that will assist them in their work. If they can succeed in electing
                        this spring, through the supineness of our party, electing officers of their
                        own stripe in Republican districts, they will not only have some <emph

                        but a positive advantage in the opportunities presented for fraud, in case
                        of a want of watchfulness on our part. Besides, such a result would give
                        them a decided advantage in the fact that it would tend for a time, to
                        continue the hallucination under which many of them labor, that
                        Republicanism is dying out. Let all our friends turn out at the polls, at
                        the spring elections, and give them a taste of the defeat which we mean
                        shall overwhelm them in the fall.</p>

                    <p>Hon. Mahlon H. Dickinson, appointed by Gov. Geary to visit and inspect the
                        several prisons and alms houses of this Commonwealth, in his report to the
                        Governor speaks as follows of the condition of our alms house:</p>
                    <p>"Franklin county alms house is located near the town of Chambersburg. The
                        buildings were erected more than fifty years ago. They are kept in good
                        repair, and will accommodate from three to four hundred persons. There are
                        two hundred acres of well cultivated land attached to it, and much of the
                        labor of the farm is done by the paupers. The institution, at the time I
                        visited it, was in good order, except that part wherein the insane are
                        confined. This place is unfit for the confinement of any class of patients
                        and more especially the insane. I found in this hospital a patient who had
                        been chained for at least <emph rend="italic">twenty years</emph>. His name
                        is <emph rend="italic">David Wagaman</emph>. He was born in Franklin county,
                        and is now about <emph rend="italic">eighty years of age</emph>. There are
                        two others who are not chained, but are occasionally confined in the cells.
                        One of them, a German, has been an inmate nearly twenty years. He seldom
                        needs restraining. There is no appliances for properly treating this
                        disease, or provision made for the physical wants of the patients confined
                        in the wards appropriated to the idiotic and insane. At the time I visited
                        the institution there were twenty-seven of this class of patients confined
                        within its walls.</p>
                    <p>"That portion of the premises occupied by the sane paupers appears to be kept
                        in good condition and its affairs well administered."</p>

                    House. The inspector thought the alms house appeared in good order but the
                    facilities for the insane were completely inadequate. He found that some inmates
                    had been chained up for twenty years.</summary>
