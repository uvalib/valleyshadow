<b>A Railroad Meeting</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article lauds the idea of a meeting amongst businessmen of Chambersburg
                    to discuss a railroad connection in Waynesboro. It details why such a connection
                    would be beneficial for the area.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We are informed that the business men of Chambersburg contemplate, at an
                        early day, assembling for the purpose of ascertaining what ought to be done,
                        and what it is possible for them to do, in the matter of securing a
                        connection with Waynesboro' by the railroad, during the present season.</p>

                    <p>We are glad that this is so, for, in our judgment, the step contemplated is a
                        long one toward success in the movement. More of information, touching the
                        state of the question which any projected enterprise presents, can be
                        gained, by all interested, in an hour's free interchange of views at a
                        general assembly, than weeks of broken, disjointed, piece-meal, chat will
                        furnish, on the street or in private places of business. Aggregation,
                        moreover, is power, as well to do as to will to do, and what the assembled
                        eyes see to be desirable the united hands and hearts are able and wiling to
                        try to accomplish. A meeting can do nothing but good, we are certain. Nor
                        can too early a date be fixed for the council. The building of a road this
                        summer, in the eastern half of the county, whereby that section will obtain
                        the advantages of connection with eastern cities is as near a certainty as
                        such things ever are. From Waynesboro to a junction somewhere, the energetic
                        men, at the other end of the line, will push a road in the coming months of
                        fair weather and it is now for Chambersburg, through her business men and
                        capitalists, to determine whether they, wishing to have the terminus here,
                        will afford the necessary and fair assistance which alone can bring it.</p>

                    <p>Let us see why they must make some positive efforts. The charter for the road
                        specifies a terminus, northward, in the fields below Scotland - that route
                        has been surveyed, and its cost learned - men's minds are accustomed to
                        think of the route as thus laid down - interests are beginning to concentre
                        upon that track, and its probable points of business - subscriptions for
                        that line are shaping - inertia is growing fast into an obstacle to change
                        to another point. Vigorous effort, it's true, would, on the part of
                        Chambersburg, brush away these cobwebby reasons, but, without that effort,
                        they determine the road.</p>

                    <p>Now, as there certainly will be a road, and its course is definitely fixed,
                        at this writing, unless something be done to counteract past action and
                        present tendencies, the meeting will be obliged to consider the reasons, if
                        any, why they ought to work determinedly as they never have worked before
                        since Chambersburg has been a town - to bring the radio to this point. The
                        advocates of a junction here are simply embarrassed by the abundance of the
                        reasons for it.</p>

                    <p>Chambersburg has much to gain by it. The section, which will be brought, in
                        effect, to her corporate limits, by the speedy intercourse the road will
                        afford, is one of the most populous, fertile and thriving, agricultural,
                        districts of the State. The trade of those townships and villages will be
                        secured to her in its present full amount and its future manifold increase.
                        She has as much to lose - for, if a junction be made either up or down the
                        valley, or both above and below, and the buyers be brought into close
                        contact with our neighboring business centres of Carlisle and Hagerstown,
                        all this trade will follow the convenience of its managers and leave our
                        county town to be the receptacle for the butter and eggs of a brace of
                        townships and nothing more.</p>

                    <p>But, the building of the road will be the proximate cause of the development
                        of a measure of material wealth, in and for the county, which, we think,
                        will astound even its owners when they come to view it as laid bare. We
                        said, once before, when talking of this road and its advantages to the town
                        and country, that the richness of the mineral wealth of the South Mountain
                        District was incalculable - we reiterate our belief in its boundless extent.
                        There is not more nor better iron ore, in the same area, any where in
                        Pennsylvania, than lies at the foot, on the slopes, and in the ravines, of
                        that mountain chain. Prospecting, rightly managed, will soon discover, in
                        paying quantities, the lead and copper, whereof specimens now glitter on the
                        writer's desk; pigments of every shade, and manganese, can be mined, in
                        quantity, to-day. Who shall say what the scene these busy districts will
                        present ten years hence, if only the locomotive make intercourse speedy and
                        transportation cheap, and who can measure the prosperity of the town which
                        will become, at once, the receiver of all of its products; and the source of
                        all of its supplies?</p>

                    <p>We deem the action to be taken by this meeting vital - we hope the business
                        men will vindicate, by their liberality and their energy, their right to the
                        title of provident, courageous, men.</p>

                    <p>Since writing the foregoing we learn that the meeting will be held in the
                        Court House during the second week of the Court. The evening will be
                        announced in our next issue.</p>

<b>The Opening Campaign</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article is a tirade against both the Democratic party and Andrew
                    Johnson, characterizing him as a man without principles and a traitor to
                    democracy.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In the view of the great campaign upon which we are about to enter, and which
                        will doubtless be contested with the very energy of despair on the part of
                        the so-called Democracy, it would be the quintessence of folly in a people
                        to ignore the past while preparing for the exigencies of the future. But at
                        the same time it behooves the American people to scrutinize closely the
                        history of the Democratic party, so that they can distinguish between the
                        real Democracy when in its palmy days it bent its energies to the great task
                        of taking care of the rights of the people, when they were threatened by
                        aristocratic endeavors to make the rights and privileges of the many
                        subservient to the interests and assumptions of the few, and the pseudo
                        Democracy of the present day. There was a time when Democracy meant
                        something. Since that time it has apostatized from its high and holy
                        calling, acting by the people, through the people and for the people. It now
                        shamelessly lends its aid to the interests of a defunct system of slavery,
                        which, after threatening the dearest rights and interests of the people, has
                        endeavored to pull down the mighty fabric of our fathers, so that an
                        aristocratic, slave-breeding and slave-driving oligarchy may rule and
                        control the laboring masses. The past, to which we would direct the
                        attention of the people, lies within the memory of every voter. The record
                        that the opposition has made, is the most unenviable that could well be
                        imagined. Think of a great nation struggling for its life, for the interests
                        of posterity and for the interests of the wide world; and then behold a part
                        of its own children, reared under its benign influence, unwilling to depart
                        the common household and cast their lot with those in open arms, yet whose
                        every act and wish demonstrated to the most casual observer, nay to the
                        enemy itself, where their sympathies were. The people cannot forget the
                        party's record in regard to the ways and means of raising and supporting our
                        army, managing our finances, and especially its contemptuous sneers at the
                        valor of our own soldiers when periling their all, yea life itself, for the
                        safety of their country.</p>

                    <p>When Andrew Johnson opposed the South, this party unblushingly denied him the
                        Senate Hall to be used in the interests of the Union, but when Andrew
                        Johnson turned his back upon his own record in behalf of freedom and right,
                        this same party basely took him to its arms and now would fain crown him as
                        a martyr to the cause of liberty. This same party which has so unmistakably
                        evinced its sympathies with rebellion and traitors, will now, through its
                        champions, profess great love for the Union - great reverence for the
                        fathers of the Republic - undying devotion to the Constitution and most
                        intense horror at the phantom of negro equality - yea all this, while
                        seeking allies amongst rebels, belieing the very name which received its
                        potency from devotion to the cause of freedom - and feeling in their hearts
                        a deep sympathy with those who have mixed their blood with the African under
                        the baneful influence of slavery. While these blatant demagogues feign to
                        forget their speeches and actions during the war, let the people look up
                        their old platforms and campaign documents, and confront them with their
                        dark and traitorous record.</p>

                    <p>That the rebels under the inspiration and encouragement of Andrew Johnson and

                        Their secret, oath-bound organization, known as the Ku Klux Klan, is the
                        wickedest and most dangerous order that has ever existed in the country, and
                        from every quarter of the South we have intelligence of the brutal murder of
                        the Union men and negroes by the members of this clan. So frequent have
                        these murders became, and so persistently and systematically are Union men
                        persecuted, that Gen. Grant has felt it his duty to take action to suppress
                        the organization. They should be crushed by armed forces at once. They are
                        simply perpetuating the rebellion in the worst guerilla form, and there can

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We publish this week a careful synopsis of the new Registry Act, which sets
                        forth all its essential features briefly and clearly, without being
                        encumbered by the surplusage which always surrounds legislative enactments:</p>

                    <p>Section 1 provides that the Assessors, after receiving their transcripts from
                        the County Commissioners, shall make a list of all white freemen above
                        twenty-one years of age, who shall make claim to be qualified voters in
                        their respective townships, wards, &amp;c., and state opposite their
                        names whether said voter is a housekeeper, and the number or place of
                        residence; and if not a housekeeper the occupation, place of boarding; and
                        if working for another, the name of his employer; and set opposite to his
                        name the word "voter." And when a party claims to be a naturalized voter, he
                        must exhibit his certificate to the Assessor, unless he shall have voted in
                        the township, borough or wards at five preceding general elections. When a
                        party has declared his intention to become a citizen, and means to be
                        naturalized before the next election, the name shall be marked D. J.</p>

                    <p>Parties between the ages of twenty-one and twenty-two, claiming to vote by
                        reason thereof, shall have the word "age" entered; and if said party has
                        moved into the district since the last general election, the letter R shall
                        be placed opposite the name. In all the above enumerated cases a tax shall
                        be assessed against the person. To carry this law into effect it shall be
                        the duty of the Commissioners of the respective counties of this
                        Commonwealth, within sixty days after the passage of this Act, to cause
                        alphabetical lists of the persons returned by the Assessors, as assessed in
                        the several district for the present year, to be made out and placed in the
                        hands of their respective Assessors, who shall, on or before the 1st of
                        September next, ascertain the qualifications of the persons therein named,
                        and their claims to vote as before mentioned, and return said lists to the
                        Commissioners as hereinafter directed. This section further provides that
                        all persons who were thus registered and permitted to vote at the next
                        preceding election in October, shall, without further proof be placed on the
                        list or registry, to be prepared for the election in November; but they and
                        all others shall be subject to challenge as prescribed by the fourth Section
                        of this Act.</p>

                    <p>Section 2 provides that when the lists of assessments are completed, as
                        provided in section 1, and returned to the County Commissioners, they shall
                        cause exact duplicates to be made, with all the observations therein noted,
                        and placed in the hands of an Assessor, who shall, before the first of
                        August next ensuing said assessment, put one copy on the door of the house
                        where the election of the district is to be held and to retain the other for
                        the inspection of every person resident in said district, free of charge,
                        who may desire to inspect the same; and on the qualification of the one
                        claiming the right to vote in said district, the Assessor shall add the
                        claimants name, and mark opposite his name C. V., and immediately assess him
                        with a tax. On the tenth day preceding the general election in October next,
                        the Assessor shall produce the list in his possession to the Inspectors and
                        Judge of election of the district, at a meeting to be held by them, as
                        provided in section 3.</p>

                    <p>Section 3 requires the Inspectors and Judge of the election and the Assessor
                        to attend at the place of holding the general elections for the respective
                        election districts on the tenth day preceding the second Tuesday in October,
                        and other succeeding days, from nine A. M. to six P. M., to hear proofs of
                        the right of persons to vote whose names are contained in the Assessor's
                        list, or who shall apply to have their names registered. And all those who
                        have not previously voted in the election district, are required to make
                        proof before this board of their right to vote in said district; and those
                        applying to be registered, whose names have not been enrolled by the
                        Assessor and marked "voter," must make like proof of their right to vote,
                        whereupon the Assessor shall assess said person with a tax as required by
                        law. The election officers shall cause duplicate copies of the lists thus
                        corrected by them to be made out, one to be placed on the door of the house
                        where the election is held, the other to be held by the Judge of the
                        election for the inspection of citizens. It is further provided that persons
                        claiming to be entitled to vote whose names have not been entered on the
                        registry of the district in which they claim to be entitled to vote, shall
                        produce, at least, one qualified voter of the election district to prove the
                        residence of the claimant in the district for the period of, at least, ten
                        days preceding the general election next ensuing. The witness shall
                        subscribe an affidavit defining clearly where the residence of the person
                        claiming to be a voter is. The person claiming the right to be registered
                        shall also be required to subscribe an affidavit stating respectively when
                        and where he was born, that he is a citizen of Pennsylvania and of the
                        United States: if a naturalized citizen he shall state when, where and by
                        what court he was naturalized, and shall present his certificate of
                        naturalization for examination, unless he has been a voter in the said
                        district for five years then next preceding. In the same manner is the
                        claimant to be registered, required to prove that he regained lost
                        citizenship, if he had lost the same, that he had not registered as a voter
                        elsewhere, that he had paid tax within two years, &amp;c. The affidavits
                        of voters and witnesses shall be preserved by the board, and on the close of
                        the election day they shall be placed in the ballot box with the other
                        papers now required by law to be preserved therein; and if the board find
                        that the applicants possess the legal qualifications of voters, they shall
                        add their names to the list alphabetically with like effect as if the same
                        had been done ten days before the election. The reception of the vote of any
                        person not so registered, shall constitute a misdemeanor in the election
                        officers so receiving it, and on conviction thereof they shall be subject to
                        fine and imprisonment.</p>

                    <p>Section 4 provides that on election day it shall be lawful for any qualified
                        citizen of the district, to challenge the vote of any person offering to
                        vote, notwithstanding his name is contained on the registry, and his right
                        to vote has been passed on by the election board, whereupon the same proof
                        as is now required by law shall be publicly made and again acted upon by the
                        board, and the vote admitted or rejected, according to the evidence.
                        Naturalized citizens will be required to produce their naturalization
                        certificates at the election, before voting, as required by existing laws,
                        although the same may have been exhibited to the election board before
                        registry. When such vote is received, the election officers shall write the
                        word "voted" thereon, with the month and year and if any election officer of
                        that or any other election district shall receive a second vote on the same
                        day, by virtue of such certificate, the person so offending shall be guilty
                        of a misdemeanor. And the officers of election who shall neglect or refuse
                        to make the endorsement required upon said certificate shall be guilty of a
                        misdemeanor.</p>

                    <p>Section 5 provides for the sealing and preserving of the registry lists, in
                        the same manner now required by law as to the tally papers.</p>

                    <p>Section 6 provides that ten days before the election for Electors of
                        President and Vice President of the United States, the board of election
                        shall convene at the place of holding the general election, to hear
                        applications of persons whose names have been omitted from the registry, and
                        who claim the right to vote in the same manner as is provided for in the
                        third section of this act.</p>

                    <p>Section 7 provides that at every special election provided by law, and at
                        every city, ward, borough or township election, the registry required to be
                        kept may be used as evidence of the persons entitled thereat to vote.</p>

                    <p>Section 8 prescribes the oath, and defines the power and duties of the boards
                        of elections, consisting of the Assessors, Inspectors and Judges, and
                        provides for their compensation.</p>

                    <p>Section 9 provides that on petition of five or more citizens of the county
                        stating that they believe that frauds will be practiced at the election
                        about to be held in any district, the Court of Common Pleas, or a Judge
                        thereat on vacation, shall appoint two persons, judicious, sober, and
                        intelligent citizens of the county, to act as overseers at said elections,
                        with proper and necessary authority to prevent the same.</p>

                    <p>Section 10 provides for the punishment of any Prothonotary or Clerk of the
                        Court who may fraudulently issue or furnish naturalization certificates.</p>

                    <p>Section 11 provides the penalty for any Assessor, election officer, or person
                        appointed as overseer, who refuses or neglects to perform any duty enjoined
                        by this act, without reasonable legal cause.</p>

                    <p>Section 12 provides the penalty and prescribes the mode of punishment to be
                        inflicted upon any tax collector found guilty of issuing a receipt for
                        taxes, said taxes not having been paid.</p>

                    <p>Section 13 provides the time for opening and closing the polls.</p>

                    <p>Section 14 directs the County Commissioners shall, at the expense of the
                        county, furnish all blanks made necessary by this act.</p>

                    <p>Section 15 repeals all laws inconsistent with this act.</p>

                    <p>The experience of most of the States, to which our own is no exception, have
                        long since established the imperfection of their election laws, and many of
                        them have devised amendments to overcome them. The weakness of our own has
                        been painfully illustrated by the enormous frauds which have attended most
                        of our elections for years; and this effort of the legislature to lessen the
                        opportunities for frauds and corruption should meet the approbation of all
                        honest minded persons of both parties. That it will we have no more doubt
                        than we have that it will meet with the bitter opposition of the Democratic
                        leaders. Experience has made it a truism that whatever makes illegal voting
                        impossible strikes at the root of the Democratic party, and we may safely
                        predict that its leaders will exhaust all the epithets in their billingsgate
                        storehouse in condemnation of this law. An equitable and just, and stringent
                        law like this will make it impossible to vote upon fraudulent naturalization
                        certificates, or to vote in more than one election district, and therefore
                        the Democracy must denounce it: just as the criminal denounces the law which
                        punishes his offenses against society, or the drunkard that which restrains
                        the vending of intoxicating drinks. The same reasons confirm honest, right
                        minded citizens in their conviction, that such laws are right and just, and
                        should be sustained. The circumstances being altered alter the
                        circumstances.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>There is a hopeful indication from the South. From nearly every quarter comes
                        the report that the negroes are showing a better disposition to work than at
                        any previous time since the war closed. What is quite as good news, the
                        planters are more ready to engage them and to fulfill their part of the
                        contract. In some localities planters are intending to do very little, but
                        even this will work to the advantage of the negroes, as they will be enabled
                        to hire land and till it on their own account. Such intelligence as this is
                        a confirmation of the opinion we have always entertained, that if the
                        negroes had anything like fair-play from the whites, the question of labor
                        and the ownership of land will settle themselves without the aid of
                        confiscation or other legislative interference.</p>
