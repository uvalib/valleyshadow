<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Margaret Shayer left a fund for children in Staunton, selected the late

                    Hendren, Esq., asked circuit court to appoint a new trustee. Judge Thompson
                    declared the fund void and the possession of the commonwealth. Following a
                    petition from residents of Staunton, however, the legislature authorize the
                    court to dispose of the sum. The court decided to distribute the money among the
                    various male and female academies. J.B. Baldwin, Geo. Baylor, and A.D. Trotter

<b>Trial of Rev. Daniel Downey</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Arguments in Downey's trial ended on 6/15/1858. Two days later, the judge
                    proclaimed a hung jury and discharged all the jurors. Rumors indicate that nine
                    jurors thought Downey was guilty of second-degree murder. Evidence indicates
                    that on 12/12/1857, the body of Mullins was discovered on the pavement near
                    Downey's house. Downey was drunk, lying on the floor of his front room.
                    Apparently, Mullins had seduced Downey's housekeeper, Margaret Lee. Mullins
                    promised to marry her, but constantly postponed the wedding. When several of
                    Downey's associates confronted Mullins, he proceeded to confront Downie. The two
                    men met in private, after which a short was heard. Witnesses found Mullins shot,
                    either dead or dying, and took his body out of the house. Nobody actually saw
