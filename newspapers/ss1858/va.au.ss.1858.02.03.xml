                    out most lustily for 'nigger,' or no 'nigger,' haven't money enough as a general
                    thing, to buy a 'plug of tobacco with.' The real bone of contention is power and
                    the spoils: and the poor nigger is made to bend and bow to suit the purposes of
                    these political demagogues, that they may ride into power and obtain some of the
                    spoils--and that's all."</excerpt>

                <summary>Problems in Kansas are the result of a few northern fanatics. These men,
                    who have no connection to slavery and seek only spoils, are stimulating the
                    possibility of national dissolution. Most northerners in the region are not
                    concerned with slavery. Meanwhile southern plantation owners have recognized
                    that they have no concerns in Kansas and are not meddling in its
                affairs.</summary>

                <summary>Jackson Hottinger arrested in Staunton on morning of 1/28/1858 by Martin
                    Rohr and Geo. H. Mitchell and charged with kidnapping a slave belonging to
                    Clement Ervine of Rockingham County. Justice Imboden sent him to jail in
                    preparation for his return to Rockingham. Rockingham "Register" reports that he
                    stole six or seven year-old slave from Ervine, gagged him, carried him into the
                    woods, but left him to evade persuit of David J. Bear. He had also tried to
                    convince two of Ervine's young slaves to leave as well. Hottinger claims that he
                    was drunk and not in control of his faculties.</summary>
