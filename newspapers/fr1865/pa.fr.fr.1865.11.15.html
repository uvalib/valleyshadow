<b>Where They Got The Notion</b><br> (Column 7)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports that blacks in the South are under the impression that land
                    re-distribution is imminent. The article places blame for the perpetuation of
                    this misinformation on southern politicians, who, in attempting to galvanize the
                    support of whites for the Confederate war effort, said that "if they did not
                    succeed in secession their lands would be divided amongst their slaves," a myth
                    that blacks "were foolish enough to believe."<br>

<b>Shall Treason Regain Its Power?</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editorial contends that there will undoubtedly be a showdown when the
                    39th Congress convenes in a few weeks whether the representatives from the
                    former rebel states should be seated. Ultimately, this decision will have
                    profound implications for the nation's future.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We are within a few weeks of the meeting of the 39th Congress. Memorable as
                        is the history of many in the past, none has ever equalled in
                        monument--whether regarded as effecting the present or the future--the
                        Congress to convene on the first Monday of December next. Various complex
                        questions will demand solution at its hands; but the gravest of all will
                        meet it at the very threshold of the session, and on its determination will
                        depend much for weal or woe to a Nation just rescued from treason by the
                        matchless heroism and countless sacrifices of a loyal people.</p>
                    <p>When the roll of the new Congress shall have been called by the Clerk, the
                        Representatives from all the States lately in rebellion against the
                        government will demand that their names be added so that they may
                        participate in the organization of the House. Mr. McPherson, the Clerk--who
                        is the presiding officer of the House until a Speaker is chosen--will refuse
                        to recognize the members from the seceded States and on the determination of
                        the inevitable motion to have the rebel names added to the roll, he will
                        call only the members whose States have maintained their fidelity to the
                        Union and thus submit the question to the deliberate consideration of
                        Congress. In this he has no alternative. The law defines his duty and he can
                        but obey it. Were he to do otherwise he would commit a most flagrant
                        usurpation, and would predetermine the most important issue to be decided by
                        the coming Congress. If he should once place their names on the roll and
                        call them on all questions arising in the organization, we should witness
                        the marvelous spectacle of a band of rebels, fresh from their inglorious
                        fields and murderous prison pens, voting themselves into Congress and into
                        power in the government they had exhausted themselves in a vain effort to
                        destroy.</p>
                    <p>We do not overrate either the magnitude or the danger of the issue.
                        Encouraged by the leniency of the administration, the Southern members will
                        be clamorous for their admission, and there will not be wanting those who
                        will bend before a united South as in olden times, and yield to the pressure
                        for their success. We shall hear much of fraternity and harmony, of
                        brotherly love; of the ties of race and language, and it is not improbable
                        that even at this early day, with the blood of the Five Forks still unwashed
                        from the soil of the Old Dominion, we shall have threats of turbulence,
                        discord and it may be disintegration if they are denied a voice in our
                        highest legislative tribunals. For all this loyal Congressmen must be
                        prepared, for thus will the conflict come and whether it shall be mighty or
                        but a ripple on the surface, depends upon the fidelity with which it is met.
                        If there shall be fear and trembling, then will the appliances of power and
                        the thunder of lordly-traitors gain ground daily, and the admission of rebel
                        delegations into our National legislature will be but a question of a few
                        weeks at most.</p>
                    <p>Should they be admitted? We are not insensible to the fact that they are to
                        form a part, and no unimportant part, or our regenerated Nation, and we
                        concede that the time must come, and we hope at an early day, when they
                        shall justly regain their proper position in all departments of the
                        government. Because they have rebelled is not, in itself, a reason for their
                        exclusion. If it were, they should be forever excluded. Nor can they be
                        placed on probation until they think, feel and act on all questions as do
                        the people of the North. They will ever cherish their heroes, mourn the
                        bereavements of their friends, and will not soon learn to love the hated
                        sons of the North whose sterner qualities they proved so fearfully for
                        themselves on many battlefields. To ask that they should forget their
                        convictions and their affections, before restoring them to power, would be
                        to doom them to lives of dependence. But we must not be unmindful that we
                        have just emerged from a terrible war--a war that has left its hundreds of
                        thousands of untimely graves; that has staggered the Nation with billions of
                        debt--a war causeless, wanton, wicked and most cruel, forced upon an
                        unwilling people without recourse to the constitutional redress for real or
                        imaginary grievances, and a war which has tangible, logical results now
                        patent to the civilized world. If these results were alike acceptable to
                        all, then would immediate fraternity in our National legislature be the
                        first duty of the vindicated government. But the deadly, desolating civil
                        war of America does not differ from other great wars in having victors and
                        vanquished; and it but repeats the history of the arbitrament of the sword
                        in all times past, in making up its results at the cost of the discomfitted.
                        The North has lost nothing in the great issues of the war, the South has
                        lost everything it staked on the conflict. The North has deep wounds to heal
                        in broken circles, and its full share of war's inexorable exactions, but it
                        has won the great principles for which it gave its noblest blood. The South
                        has no less sorrows to solace and has lost the issues it staked in the
                        deadly struggle. It is defeated, subjugated and bows sullenly to hopeless
                        disaster. It yielded nothing while the sword could be drawn in wrath; while
                        man could meet man in bloody strife. A common Government, a common
                        Nationality and a common Inheritance, weighed as nothing in giving us peace.
                        It was a surrender to the direst necessity, and they now come with life,
                        property, honor, citizenship, everything forfeited by treason--with nothing
                        more to lose and everything to gain, whether little or much, in the work of
                        restoration and yet we learn from their leaders that their representatives
                        have unquestioned right to seats in Congress to determine the penalty for
                        their own offences and to direct the destiny of the government they failed
                        to overthrow.</p>
                    <p>The results of this war are far from defined and settled in the policy of the
                        government. Slavery has been abolished by the war we are told. How? If the
                        States are in the Union, and ever were, then was Emancipation a monstrous
                        usurpation, unless accompanied by constitutional amendment, and if they are
                        sovereign States in the Union, so that they are entitled to representation
                        without question, then are their provisional Governors usurpers, and the
                        Presidential instructions that they must abolish slavery, repudiate debt,
                        &amp;c. the work of a dictator and confronting the very genius of our
                        institutions. We accept the destruction of slavery as one of the logical,
                        inevitable results of the war, but how and upon what terms is it abolished?
                        Georgia demands compensations for slaves, so does Louisiana, and so would
                        all if they sacrificed discretion to truth. It will be for Congress to
                        determine whether slavery shall fall as a legitimate fruit of treason's war
                        or whether it shall be compensated and the Nation give still millions more
                        to compromise with its crowning crime. Who should determine this grave
                        question? The North whose valor fairly won the results? Or the South who
                        made the war for slavery and lost it?</p>
                    <p>The South comes professing no surrender of principle. It justified the war on
                        the plea of State rights, and yields not its favorite fallacy in demanding
                        admission. Shall this question remain as heretofore a stumbling block for
                        honest men, and a stepping stone for future traitors to inaugurate fresh
                        discord and probably future war? If not, who should and who must, adjust the
                        question for the safety of the Nation? Should the friends or the foes of the
                        government devise the measures necessary to avert war and preserve the
                        Nation's life by peaceful means? It is confessedly wisdom to leave no
                        important questions open to latitude of construction for present or future
                        traitors, and who should judge the remedy? Those who in their richest blood
                        and with boundless treasure maintained the right? Or those who deluged a
                        continent in gore to overthrow its authority? Our debt is crushing; it
                        weighs heavily upon the loyal millions who cheerfully incurred it for
                        government and law; but it is an accepted law of war that its authors may be
                        made to bear its fullest burden. Such was the policy of this government,
                        which relentlessly confiscated the property of every loyal man North and
                        South that it could reach, and such was the deliberate enactment of our own
                        Congress. In the South every claim due the North, and the property of every
                        loyal man was confiscated. Real estate may now be restored, but who is to
                        restore the millions of dollars plundered from the loyal citizens in the
                        South which perished in its use? Shall restitution to such be made from the
                        property of those who inaugurated the war? Shall it be done from our common
                        treasure, or shall it not be done at all? These inquiries are yet to be
                        answered by the highest legislative power, and who shall decide them? Shall
                        the men who made the war and the debt, and who were instrumental in the
                        spoliation of loyal citizens in the South, become judges in Congress in the
                        adjudication of these momentous questions? Our Congress has solemnly enacted
                        as a punishment for treason, that no traitor shall sit in our National
                        legislature--that none but such can affirm that they have not aided or
                        abetted the rebellion can be qualified as members. The strict enforcement of
                        this law should exclude every Southern member elect. Should they be admitted
                        in violation of the law and aid in the determination of the issue whether
                        this penalty for treason should be revoked? If treason is thus to sit in
                        judgment upon treason, where will be the penalty for the crime?--where the
                        reward for virtue? Our organic law may prove to be defective--unequal to the
                        preservation of our great National compact; and to whom should be entrusted
                        the responsible duty of adjusting it to heal a country's woes? Surely not to
                        those who have ever struggled to weaken and subvert our great charter and
                        ended their perfidy in revolution. There are billions of rebel debt. Shall
                        it be paid in part or in whole? There are thousands upon thousands of rebel
                        maimed and scarred, won with a heroism worthy of a better cause, and there
                        are other thousands of bereaved mothers who would have irresistible claims
                        upon the generosity of a government to which they had been faithful? Shall
                        they be pensioners upon our common treasury? These are issues which treason
                        does not flaunt upon its banner as it thunders at the doors of Congress, but
                        they must be met, and who shall meet them? If met by united delegations of
                        rebels from the Southern States, with their concentrated power to appeal to
                        ambition, well may the patriot despair of the Republic.</p>
                    <p>Let no Union man from Pennsylvania presume so much upon a faithful
                        constituency as to hazard every issue of the war by the admission of the
                        rebel delegations into Congress. They come in pursuance of no law; the
                        offspring of a provisional organization that is but a petition to Congress
                        for acceptance; and we owe it to the faithful people who have maintained the
                        government; to the hundreds of thousands of our martyred heroes who were
                        sacrificed upon the altars of our liberties; to the hopeful living who are
                        stricken in their holiest affections by the madness of treason; and above
                        all do we owe it to the future peace and harmony of a mighty Nation, that
                        every issue of the war shall be definitely and irrevocably adjusted; that
                        its full fruition shall be fixed as the stars in the spheres, before one
                        faithless representative of a faithless State shall sit in judgment on
                        Freedom's noblest struggle for mankind!</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article argues that the congressional contest between Gen. Koontz and
                    Gen. Coffroth was plagued by corruption and "organized fraud," and casts blame
                    for the irregularities on the Democrats, who refused to allow the soldiers'
                    vote.<br>

                    <p>Owing to the flagrant disregard of the law by certain Democratic return
                        Judges in this Congressional district, General Koontz's name is omitted from
                        the Governor's proclamation certifying to the list of members of Congress
                        elect from Pennsylvania. Gen. Coffroth is also without the formal
                        recognition of the Executive proclamation, and the certificate on which he
                        relies to give him his seat entirely omits the vote of Somerset county,
                        where a majority of over 800 was cast against him. His friends, in insolent
                        disregard of their solemn oaths, and in disregard of the plainest provisions
                        of law, rejected a portion of the soldiers' vote, even after it had been
                        computed by the return Judges of Fulton county, and thus made an apparent
                        majority for him; but when the district Judges met, they concluded to do the
                        clean thing, and they made out a return for him omitting an entire county
                        and on that they gave him a certificate.</p>
                    <p>Owing to the organized fraud in a circle of Democratic return judges--that
                        party having the control of the Boards of four of the five counties--Gen.
                        Koontz was unable to get the full and correct vote certified by the persons
                        chosen to perform that duty; but he has it properly certified from the
                        records, under the seals of the respective Prothonotaries, and will thus
                        present it to Congress. The official vote was as follows:</p>

                    <p>That this vote was cast and properly returned to the Prothonotaries of the
                        proper counties no one pretends to deny; and that it was the duty of the
                        return judges to compute it and issue a certificate of election in
                        accordance therewith, is clear from the following section of the law:</p>
                    <p>And it shall not be lawful for said Judges or clerks in
                            casting up the votes which shall appear to have been given, as
                        shown by the certificates under the 76th and 77th sections of this act to omit or reject any part thereof, except where in
                        the opinion of said Judges, such certificate is so defective, as to present the same from being under stood, and
                            computed in adding together the number of votes.</p>
                    <p>In open disregard of this law the army vote was withheld, and while it did
                        not secure Gen. Coffroth a certificate, it did deprive Gen. Koontz of such
                        testimonials as are necessary to enable him to be placed on the rolls when
                        Congress meets. Certainly one of these men is entitled to be sworn as prima facie elected, and we submit to Congressmen
                        whether the man who has, confessedly, a clear majority
                            of the whole vote returned in the district, is not that man. It
                        is not disputed that Gen. Koontz has such a majority, and we insist that he
                        shall be admitted at once on the evidence to that effect, and thus prevent a
                        district from being entirely disfranchised for two or three months until a
                        committee shall decide the case. If illegal votes have been polled, let Gen.
                        Coffroth contest in the regular way and establish, if he can, that the
                        majority for Gen. Koontz is made up of illegal votes. If he can prove that
                        such is the case he will be justly entitled to his seat; but until then the
                        clear majority cast and regularly returned gives Gen. Koontz a just and
                        legal claim to the seat until his vote is shown to be fraudulent.</p>
                    <p>We ask the attention of Congressmen to this peculiar case and ask only that
                        it shall be judged by law and equity according to the well settled rules
                        which govern elections. If it shall be so judged, Gen. Koontz will be sworn
                        at once in obedience to the instructions of the House, and a fair contest,
                        if Coffroth shall so determine, will establish the folly of his claim to
                        represent us in defiance of the vote of the people.</p>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Henry Wirz, the jailor of the charnel house of Andersonville, was executed in
                        Washington on Friday last in the Old Capital Prison yard, in obedience to
                        the finding and sentence of the military commission as approved by the
                        President. He persisted to the last in denying that he had willfully
                        starved, murdered, or maltreated Union prisoners, although the testimony on
                        the trial was overwhelming and cumulative to an extent that precluded the
                        possibility of doubt as to the fiendish character of the man. He gave to the
                        reporters of the press a detailed account of his life, carefully
                        establishing his good traits, as though he dreaded the imputation of the
                        unnatural crimes charged against him next to death. His last letter was
                        written to one of his counsel just before mounting the gallows, in which he
                        appealed for assistance for his family. He said in it that "if anyone ought
                        to come to the relief of my family it is the people of the South, for whom I
                        have sacrificed all." After his execution, his body was delivered to Father
                        Boyle, his spiritual adviser, for interment.</p>
                    <p>Thus has the creature of murderous treason atoned for the monstrous
                        atrocities which doomed twenty thousand Union prisoners to loathsome
                        disease, lingering starvation and death; but where are his principals? The
                        record of the trial of Wirz shows that he was arraigned, tried and convicted
                        for "combining, confederating and conspiring together with Jefferson Davis,
                        James A. Seddon, Howell Cobb, John H. Winder, Richard B. Winder, Isaiah H.
                        White, S.P. Moore,--Kerr, late hospital steward at Andersonville, James
                        Duncan, Wesley W. Turner, Benjamin Harris, and others unknown to injure the
                        health and destroy the lives of soldiers in the military service of the
                        United States, then held and being prisoners of war," &amp;c. Upon this
                        charge Wirz was found guilty--not guilty merely of murdering Union prisoners
                        himself, but guilty of "combining, confederating and conspiring together"
                        with Davis, Seddon, and others to accomplish the deliberate murder of
                        prisoners of war. This finding the President approves with the sentence, and
                        upon this record, sanctioned by a court martial and approved by the highest
                        officer in the government, the poor creature--the miserable tool of the
                        chief murderers,--is executed. What shall be the fate of his principals?
                        When and how will they be tried? Is justice to be satisfied by the
                        punishment of an irresponsible subordinate, while his superiors whose
                        bidding he was bound to obey are enjoying their freedom and helping to
                        reconstruct the government, or calmly waiting in comfortable confinement,
                        the coming day when they may be discharged with impunity?</p>

                    <p>That at an election held on the 11th day of October, ultimo, in and for said
                        county, the electors of said county voted inter
                        alins for the office of District Attorney of said county, and that by
                        the return of the judges of said election, made on the 25th day of October,
                        ultimo, it appears that there were cast for William S. Stenger three
                        thousand five hundred and forty-eight votes, and for D. Watson Rowe three
                        thousand five hundred and forty-five votes, showing a majority of three
                        votes in favor of the said Wm. S. Stenger, and that the said judges
                        thereupon issued a certificate of election to the said William S. Stenger.</p>
                    <p>And your petitioners would further represent, that at the time of the meeting
                        of said return judges, the returns of the election for said county, held in
                        pursuance of law by persons in the military service of the United States in
                        the State of Texas, to wit: the 77th Regiment of Pennsylvania Veteran
                        Volunteers and Battery (26th Ind. Penna.) had not been received and were
                        consequently not counted; but your petitioners are informed, and verily
                        believe, that at said election in said military organizations, the said D.
                        Watson Rowe had a large majority of the votes cast, to wit: at least fifty
                        majority and that adding the votes cast for the said D. Watson Rowe in the
                        said military organizations to the votes cast for the said D. Watson Rowe in
                        said county, and already enumerated by the said return judges, the said D.
                        Watson Rowe has a majority of all the votes cast and was duly elected
                        District Attorney of said county, and that your petitioners cannot annex a
                        schedule of said votes so as aforesaid cast in said military organizations,
                        because no official report of the same has yet been received.</p>
                    <p>And your petitioners further show that the said election was undue, and that
                        the said D. Watson Rowe was duly elected District Attorney of said county,
                        and not the said William S. Stenger, and they set forth the following facts:
                        That at the said election the four following (among others) illegal and
                        fraudulent votes were cast for the said William S. Stenger, to wit: the vote
                        of Curtis Danielson and George Miller, who voted at the election held at the
                        public house of Jacob Elliott, for the part of Montgomery township; the vote
                        of John Talhelm, who voted at the election held at the house of John Adams,
                        in the Borough of Greencastle, for Antrim township and parts of Peters and
                        Montgomery, and the vote of Abraham Sheely, who voted at the public house of
                        David Taylor, in the South Ward of the Borough of Chambersburg, at an
                        election held at said house for said ward, all which votes were illegal and
                        fraudulent, because the said named voters were, at the time of said
                        election, deserters from the military service of the United States, having
                        been drafted into said service and having failed to report to the Provost
                        Marshal of the 16th District of Pennsylvania, composed in part of the said
                        county of Franklin, for muster into service according to law, and remaining
                        at the date of said election registered on the records of said Provost
                        Marshal's office as deserters.</p>
