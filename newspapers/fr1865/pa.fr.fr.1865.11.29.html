<b>Congress</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Thirty-Ninth Congress will convene shortly, and it is widely expected
                    that the body will not include representatives from the states formerly in
                    rebellion. It is also expected that the President will not try to override this
                    decision; rather, the article explains, "he will submit the whole question to
                    Congress."<br>

<b>The Victory Complete</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The returns from the 77th Regiment have finally been processed, and as the
                    editors expected, they have secured victories for David McConaughy and Col. Rowe
                    in their respective contests.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>At length we have the full returns from the 77th regiment, and they give a
                        majority of 6 to Mr. M'Conaughy over Mr. Duncan, for Senator, and give Col.
                        Rowe a majority of 14 over Mr. Stenger for District Attorney. No one of
                        either party had doubted that if the men of the 77th from Franklin and Adams
                        had an opportunity to vote, they would more than reverse the nominal
                        majorities given to Stenger and Duncan by the home vote, and it will be a
                        matter of congratulation on the part of the Union men, that these brave
                        soldiers who have defended their cause in the field, have by their ballots
                        given it victory at home. This result insures that Mr. McConaughy's
                        admission into the Senate in a few weeks after the commencement of the
                        session, as he will contest solely on the ground that the full returns on
                        their face elect him and entitle him to the seat. Mr. Duncan will of course
                        be sworn at the organization of the Senate, if he shall claim to be sworn in
                        the face of a majority cast against him; but a brief contest will eject him
                        and give the Union men the Senator they have clearly chosen. The accident
                        that the 77th was in Texas, thousands of miles away, which delayed the
                        filing of their returns until after the day fixed by law for awarding the
                        certificates, gives Mr. Duncan a prima facia
                        right to the seat; but will he take it now that his advantage is but a
                        technical one and confronting the full poll of the district? If Mr.
                        McConaughy should claim the seat in the face of a legal majority against
                        him, we should consider him unworthy of the confidence of the Union men of
                        the district. We should second no effort to give place to Union men by
                        fraud, or in violation of the will of the people; but Mr. Duncan and his
                        friends may or may not accept the decision manfully and allow Mr. McConaughy
                        to be sworn.</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article reports that John Reed Jr. was found not guilty for the murder
                    of Jacob Crouse in Bedford county. Disturbed that Reed has been cleared of the

                    contrast, was a patriot whose only crime was his propensity to "express what

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Mr. John B. Reed, Jr., was tried in Bedford last week for the murder of Jacob
                        Crouse, and the jury, after deliberating about an hour, brought in a verdict
                        of not guilty, whereupon the defendant was discharged.</p>
                    <p>This case was a remarkable one in several respects, and, while we do not
                        question the finding of the jury, it presents some grave questions which are
                        well worthy of consideration. Mr. Reed was confessedly disloyal. He had no
                        sympathy with the government which guaranteed to him all the civil,
                        religious and political rights, but on the contrary notoriously sympathized
                        with its murderous foes. He fled his country in the day of peril to escape
                        service in its cause, and took refuge under the flag of a foreign and
                        unfriendly government. But necessity compelled Congress to protect itself
                        against such faithless citizens, and to save disfranchisement he returned to
                        his home and saved his citizenship by an appeal to the Provost Marshal
                        General. Jacob Crouse was a loyal man--loyal to indiscretion it may be. He
                        naturally hated skulking disloyalists who when at home denounced their
                        country and its cause, and who abroad affiliated with the emissaries of
                        treason. He was prone to express what every loyal man felt when he met the
                        full plumed, defiant, blatant apologist of treason, and we infer from the
                        verdict of the jury, that he did provoke breaches of the peace, and was
                        responsible for the affray in which he was killed. We accept this as the
                        fact, because if the evidence did not establish it, then was the acquittal
                        but a mockery of justice.</p>
                    <p>Thus has ended as far as the law is potential, the sad affair which made
                        Jacob Crouse find an untimely grave, and acquitted Mr. Reed of murder within
                        the law. No punishment is meted out by human hands; but of all those
                        involved in the actions of several years which culminated in this homicide,
                        Mr. Jno. P. Reed, Jr., is most to be pitied. However others may feel, he
                        will not be insensible to the rod of the inexorable avenger. There will be
                        calm, sad moments to cloud his future life when he must trace the untimely
                        death of Mr. Crouse, not to the madness of Mr. Crouse, but to the perfidy he
                        manifested to an imperiled country; and the consciousness that such a fate
                        was the offspring of such a cause, and that the living will point to him as
                        stained with blood which common patriotism would have averted, will be a
                        fearful, relentless avenger throughout his life. There are still worse
                        punishments than the cell or the halter.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>WILL THE NEGRO WORK?--We are continually informed, says Providence Journal, that the negro will not work unless he is
                        obliged to. Does it ever occur to these captious critics that in this
                        respect Sambo shows himself to be "a man and a brother;" that in this
                        respect, if in no other, he resembles the white man? By being obliged to
                        work is to be understood having some definite object and incentive for work.
                        It is quite evident that neither a negro nor a white man will voluntarily
                        work, when the proceeds of his labor go into the pockets of another. It is
                        equally evident that when food and clothing, comfort and competency, are the

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>It is reported that there has been some "speculative movement in Oil
                    stocks" recently. Consequently, stocks that "have good territory and honest
                    efforts to effect developments" are expected to "command a good price." Several
                    companies, including the Sterling and the Pennsylvania Imperial Companies, are
                    scheduled to hold stock holders meetings in the upcoming weeks to discuss their
