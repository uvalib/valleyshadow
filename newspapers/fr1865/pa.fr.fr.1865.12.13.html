<b>Congress--The President</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The President's speech, asserts A. K. McClure, the chief editor of the
                    Repository, "resolved the painful doubts" that have circulated since the end of
                    the war. In his address, Johnson made clear his position that the former states
                    in rebellion were never officially out of the Union, thus opposing Congress'
                    stand on the issue. Although McClure acknowledges that "there is an apparent
                    want of harmony" between the positions of the executive and legislative branches
                    of the government on this question, he expresses the opinion that the chasm can
                    be broached so long as Johnson recognizes Congress' primacy in determining the
                    policy for readmission.<br>

                        Editorial Correspondence of the Franklin
                        Repository.
                    </p>
                    <p>Washington, December 6, 1865.</p>
                    <p>Monday last was a memorable day in the history of the Nation. It resolved the
                        painful doubts which have for months past oppressed the faithful people of
                        the country, and set at rest, in unmistakable language and purpose, the
                        policy of Congress touching the proposed admission of the rebellious States.
                        It was a proud achievement for the few who braved the, at times, apparently
                        resistless current of sentiment that made half-subdued traitors insolent and
                        confident in their demands for fellowship as law-makers in the highest
                        legislative tribunals of the Nation; and it was decisive in its teachings as
                        it was overwhelming in the unity of the majority, in pointing the future
                        path of those who vainly sought by wanton war to destroy the government.</p>
                    <p>It was the crowning achievement of Thaddeus Stevens' life. He has out-lived
                        ambition in its accepted signification. The high places of power which he
                        has not reached, may one day have entered into his hopes; but for four years
                        past he has devoted himself with a singleness of purpose rarely equalled and
                        never surpassed in statesmanship, to give success to the true principles of
                        government, and especially to make a resented and regenerated Nation true to
                        its own high prerogatives, so dearly won by countless sacrifice. He was of
                        the few who in the early stage of the war realized its terrible import and
                        plead for the only adequate remedy. He did not stop to quibble on mere
                        abstractions, but he recognized accomplished facts. He looked the fearful
                        peril in the face, pointed to its vital power, and plead with an unwilling
                        people to accept their own and their country's safety. Slowly but surely, as
                        experience and mingled success and discomfiture, developed the appalling
                        strength and purpose of treason, and the weakness that would protect its
                        sustaining power while professing to conquer it, has he won the loyal States
                        to his convictions, until on Monday last the Union representatives, as with
                        one voice, declared that there is a conquered people, without government or
                        law, demanding the protecting care of Congress.</p>
                    <p>The passage of Mr. Stevens' resolution at the time it was proposed, and
                        without a single dissenting Union voice, is of uncommon significance. The
                        hosts of brawling politicians who hang about the capital, from North and
                        South, in search of spoils, are ready to assail the action of the House as
                        an attempt to forestall the President. Such is not the fact. The House
                        declared its purpose thus frankly and decisively at the very threshold of
                        its labors, in order that loyal and disloyal alike might know at once that
                        Congress meant to assume its conceded prerogatives touching the seceded
                        States, and discharge its high duties without fear or favor. Whether the
                        President should agree or disagree with Congress was not a question that en-
                        the action of the Union majority. As the disposition of the conquered States
                        is for Congress and for Congress alone to determine, it was obviously its
                        first duty to meet the anxious expectations of all sections of the country
                        by declaring its policy, particularly when that could be done with entire
                        unanimity by the party in power. The message of the President was already
                        printed and ready for delivery to Congress, so that no hope could have been
                        entertained to compel its modification, had modification been deemed
                        desirable.</p>
                    <p>The meaning of the House resolution admits of no doubtful construction. It in
                        no sense reflects upon the efforts of the President to place the Southern
                        States in a position to ask recognition. It does not confront his policy in
                        any degree; but it teaches what the South would have done well to appreciate
                        from the start that while the President can kindly aid them to take the
                        preliminary steps for re-admission, he does not assume, and cannot assume,
                        to determine the conditions precedent to their success. He did his duty
                        earnestly, hopefully, fraternally and most generously; but his magnanimity
                        has been rewarded with sullen, reluctant submission, or open, insolent
                        defiance of his appeals. He begged of their hesitating, obstinate
                        conventions, "For God's sake repudiate the rebel debt," or "I trust in God
                        that you will ratify the proposed amendment of the constitution abolishing
                        slavery;" but his success was but partial, and then only wrung from
                        unwilling subjects. He hoped by thus pleading with them to induce them to
                        place themselves in a position so acceptable that they could with justice
                        and prosperity be re-united with us in the present Congress; but it was all
                        in vain. Some of the States repealed the ordnance of secession thus
                        declaring their right to re-enact it. Others repudiated the rebel debt by
                        convention without a vote of the people, while the elections soon following
                        gave signal success only to Executives and legislators who were pledged to
                        its payment. Some adopted the proposed amendment to the constitution with
                        conditions. Georgia and Louisiana desiring compensation, and one or two
                        others protesting with their ratification of the same against a particular
                        construction of it. Not one of these States has chosen a
                            loyal Executive. Not one has failed to elect the most traitorous
                        of the candidates presented, excepting only South Carolina, and there Wade
                        Hampton had to decline running and exert all his power against himself to
                        save Mr. Orr by a few hundred votes. Not one of these States has as yet
                        conferred any rights whatever upon the emancipated negroes. They have in
                        every instance where the question was considered, denied them the right to
                        be parties to suits or witnesses in court--thus refusing them all rights
                        necessary to enforce contracts with their employers or protect themselves
                        from violence and wrong. Nine-tenths of the Congressmen elected in these
                        States are disqualified to serve by a law of the very Congress in which they
                        ask admission, and they were elected both with a full knowledge on the part
                        of both voters and candidates that they were ineligible by their active
                        participation in treason's war against the Republic. In many instances true
                        men ran, and appealed to the people to recognize the results of the war in
                        good faith by the election of men who could be qualified; but in an
                        overwhelming majority of instances they were defeated solely because they
                        had not been thorough traitors.</p>
                    <p>Such are the fruits of President Johnson's generous policy to reconstruct the
                        rebel States, and he is sadly disappointed at the return for his faithful
                        efforts. Two months ago he was hopeful, even confident that they would come
                        with such evidences of sincerity and repentance as would justify him in
                        asking and urging their admission; but now he recites his efforts, deals
                        them some "glittering generalities," and submits their case to Congress,
                        without even a word of endorsement. In this condition do the Southern States
                        for the first time present themselves for the consideration of Congress, and
                        the verdict of the popular branch on Monday last is the answer. That it is
                        clear, positive, and conclusive, is its crowning wisdom, and there is not a
                        traitor today who aimed to climb into Congress by half-way atonement and
                        obedience to the government, who is not a wiser if not a sadder man. All
                        such can go home, and learn anew that the North has won the Nation's
                        deliverance through the blood of her noblest sons, and that its full
                        fruition for freedom and perpetual Union cannot and shall not be arrested by
                        restoring to power the treason that drenched a continent in fraternal blood.</p>
                    <p>The message of the President does not, in fact, antagonize the position of
                        Congress although in theory there is an apparent want of harmony. He adopts
                        as his theory that secession is an impossibility because forbidden by the
                        organic law. Whether or not it is so forbidden, I do not discuss. The
                        compact which united the States was a folly and a fraud if it did not go to
                        the perpetual unity of the Republic. But when a body of States one-third the
                        number of the whole deliberately rescinded their bonds of allegiance, with
                        all the ceremony of law known to the people of the States, and for four
                        years exercised all the functions of government, general and local;
                        political, judicial and military, and devised and enforced the collection of
                        revenues--all without the show of organized remonstrance, and, in addition,
                        waged a war unparalleled in magnitude, at times thundering at the very gates
                        of our capital, it is to my mind the refinement of an abstraction to deny
                        the logic of such appalling facts. Theorize as we may, still the facts
                        confront us, and no subtlety or reasoning will serve to dispel them. If even
                        so, abstractly, still we must deal with the facts as they present themselves
                        with their terrible realities. The fact that secession may be accepted as an
                        impossibility constitutionally considered, does not take from treason one of
                        its monstrous deformities, or restore a State to the condition in which the
                        supremacy of treason found it. The facts [illeg], of wide spread desolation,
                        and States wrung violently from their proper spheres into the bloody vortex
                        of rebellion, still remain, and these facts--not the legal fiction of an
                        unbroken Union--must be dealt with. Congress so accepted the condition of
                        the States, and declared them beyond the pale of the Union. Their
                        representatives were denied admission, their votes for President were, by
                        almost unanimous vote of all parties, declared in advance to be void. The
                        Executive has by various proclamations treated them as public enemies, and
                        every important step taken for the suppression of the rebellion in aid of
                        the military power of the government, discarded the idea that they were
                        sovereign States in the Union. The Supreme Court harmonized with Congress
                        and the Executive on this important point, and pronounced them, in its
                        judicial decisions, to be public enemies, condemned their prizes as they
                        would have condemned those of England or France had we been at war with
                        them, and in all things held them--not as States and an integral part of the
                        Union--but as public enemies by reason of the complete supremacy of the
                        rebellion in the seceded States, and at war with the government of the
                        United States, as a belligerent power.</p>
                    <p>Thus do stubborn facts and the no less stubborn records of the Nation, define
                        the status of the seceded States, and ably and plausibly as President
                        Johnson presents his theory, he fails to dispel the realities which now
                        confront him and Congress. As a theory of government for the future guidance
                        of the Nation, it would be well thus to define the relations of the States
                        to the government by an amendment of our organic law; but with the present
                        we have to deal. The President confesses this himself by every step he has
                        taken to effect the reconstruction of the rebel States. If they are
                        sovereign States, they have Executives, legislatures, and most other
                        officers elected under laws which are not part of the rebellion. How are
                        they displaced? By what authority? Are they traitors? If so, they must be
                        tried, convicted and condemned before they can be removed, and then the law
                        of the State supply the vacancy. If Virginia never was out of the Union,
                        "Extra Billy Smith" is the lawful Governor of the State, as he was chosen in
                        conformity with the laws which existed there for half a century. So is Vance
                        Governor of North Carolina, quite a better man than Gov. Worth--and M'Grath
                        is Governor of South Carolina. But President Johnson puts Gov. M'Grath in
                        Fort Pulaski and appoints Gov. Perry to govern the people of what he would
                        regard as a State never beyond the pale of the Union. Nor does he stop
                        there. After displacing the Governors regularly chosen under laws enacted
                        before the rebellion, he selects their successors, directs conventions to be
                        called, and when called, instructs them to do thus and not to do so. He
                        maintains in all of them martial law, and has quasi civil governments in operation subject to the will of his
                        military commanders. If a judge decides a question in a manner
                        unsatisfactorily to the military, he is assured of his State being in the
                        Union by fluding quarters in some hospitable fort, and all other ministerial
                        officers of the civil law perform their functions as instructed by the
                        President of the "General Commanding."</p>
                    <p>In all this the President is right in fact, but how much it leaves of his
                        theory of the independent sovereignty of the States, is not to my mind
                        apparent. He finds these States in the hands of traitors--stubborn,
                        relentless, unrepenting traitors. He has conquered them by force of arms,
                        and has exercised the right of the conquerer to dethrone their rulers, and
                        to govern them with the strong arm of military law, regardless of their once
                        proud position as States in the Union, and in this he has but faithfully
                        discharged his duty. That he hopes to restore them at an early day to full
                        fellowship, and that he would thus restore them with less exacting
                        conditions than Congress, is not to be questioned; but he wisely and
                        patriotically refers the subject to Congress, where it rightfully belongs,
                        and I am strengthened in the hope that they will cordially harmonize upon
                        just terms of admission--terms which will insure the safety of the Nation
                        and as the President says, make treason infamous. In this responsible work,
                        he will be generously sustained by Congress and the country in every effort
                        tending to the speedy restoration of a loyal and regenerated Union.</p>
                    <p>The message is upon the whole a State paper of rare ability. It is calm,
                        dignified, able and in most things candid. I infer from his remarks upon the
                        trial of traitors, that Jeff Davis will yet be tried; but I do not think him
                        in serious danger of losing his life by capital punishment, I presume, since
                        Congress has been so positive in its expression on the claims of traitors to
                        civil power, that there may be rather fewer pardons hereafter than
                        heretofore, and I look for Congress and the President to work harmoniously
                        to teach the world that "mercy to traitors is cruelty to the Nation."</p>
                    <p>I did not see the President. Severe illness prevented me from filling an
                        appointment to meet him on Monday morning, and three days of racking fever
                        in Washington would make any man take the first train going hence in almost
                        any direction.<br> A. K. M.</p>

<b>The Case of Gen. Koontz</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In a replay of the controversy that occurred in 1864, the congressional
                    election between Gen. Coffroth and Gen. Koontz has been plagued by fraud and
                    conspiracy, report the editors. The editors express the belief, however, that
                    Gen. Koontz will emerge victorious once the competing claims are investigated.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The sixteenth district of Pennsylvania is without a representative in
                        Congress. The several counties composing it have not been reduced to a
                        territorial condition that we know of, nor is their status as part of the
                        United States just now questionable, however doubtful a portion of the
                        territory has been in times past when treason plunged its armed battalions
                        into the North; nor have the people failed to elect, for they went through
                        the regular form of choosing a Congressman in October, 1864, after an
                        animated struggle; nor is our failure to be represented for want of a
                        claimant for the seat, for no less than two gentlemen are in Washington
                        proposing to represent us--the one because he was elected, and the other
                        because he wasn't elected. Still we have no several weeks to come we shall
                        thus be disfranchised in the popular branch of Congress.</p>
                    <p>The laws of Pennsylvania provide that the qualified electors shall vote for
                        members of Congress and other officers on the second Tuesday of October;
                        that each election board shall select one of its number to meet in the
                        county town on Friday following the election to compute the votes cast in
                        the several districts, and where two or more counties compose a district,
                        the return judges of each county select one of their number to bear the
                        returns to the place appointed by law to compute the returns of the counties
                        comprising the district. The law in express terms forbids such return judges
                        to reject any part of the vote so returned; but they are required and sworn
                        to compute it and certify in accordance therewith. They have no judicial
                        powers--on the contrary they are in unequivocal terms denied such powers. It
                        is their duty to compute the whole returns correctly, and leave to the
                        tribunals appointed by law to inquire into frauds or illegal votes. In
                        addition to this, the law providing for the vote of soldiers in the service,
                        declares that no mere irregularity or informality shall prevent any return
                        from being computed by return judges at home. Pennsylvania has no Board of
                        Canvassers, or any other board but her courts, competent to inquire into the
                        legality of a vote or a return after the vote is once in the ballot-box.</p>
                    <p>It happened in 1864 that the people of the 16th district were about tired of
                        being represented by Gen. A. H. Coffroth, and they elected Gen. Wm. H.
                        Koontz in his stead by a majority of some 74 votes. It also happened,
                        however, that the Democrats, the friends of Gen. Coffroth, controlled the
                        boards of return Judges in four of the five counties of the district, and
                        when the army vote returned, settled his case by the election of Gen.
                        Koontz, a systematic conspiracy was formed to defraud the people out of two
                        Assemblymen, a President Judge and a Congressman of their choice, by
                        rejecting a part of the soldiers vote, in insolent violation of the law,
                        after it had been regularly returned so that they had no choice but to
                        compute it or reject it by perjury. They accordingly certified two defeated
                        candidates for Assembly as elected, one President Judge and one Congressman;
                        but when the returns came before the Governor he at once refused to
                        recognize Gen. Coffroth's certificate, as it bore on its face a palpable
                        disregard of the law, but as judges had the power to withhold the
                        certificate due to Gen. Koontz, the Executive, in the exercise of purely
                        ministerial duties, could not correct, and both were denied
                        recognition--Gen. Coffroth because his was a manifest fraud, and Gen. Koontz
                        because he had been defrauded. The same fraud came up before the Governor
                        when he had to issue a commission to the President Judge, and as he was
                        competent to decide that case prima facia, he did
                        not hesitate to reject the fraud and commission Judge King who had been
                        clearly elected. It is due to Judge Kimmell, his Democratic competitor, to
                        say that he did not ask the commission, and did not in any formal manner
                        claim that he was elected. He had no hand in the fraud, and did not seek to
                        take advantage of it.</p>
                    <p>In the only case, therefore, where the Governor could take cognizance of this
                        fraud, he determined it against Coffroth and against his wrong, and no one
                        complained that injustice was done thereby. In the case of the two members
                        of the legislature who obtained a majority certificate by this fraud, the
                        House summarily disposed of them by instructing the clerk to call the
                        members who had received the highest number of votes in the district.
                        Coffroth's friends of course were thereby left out, and instead of
                        contesting and claiming that the majority was made up of illegal votes, they
                        bent their steps homeward without delay, glad to escape the disgrace of an
                        exposition of the villainy on which they founded their case. Thus was this
                        same Coffroth fraud twice determined in Pennsylvania, and no one has had the
                        hardihood to contest or ask any investigation.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Coffroth is alone of all those who conceived and perpetrated this fraud
                        in now seeking to profit by it. Some allowance is to be made for him,
                        because of the absence of ordinary moral perceptions in his organization;
                        but we insist that where everybody, on every side, but himself confesses his
                        defeat and would shrink from the contest he invites, he ought to begin to
                        suspect that the day may come when he should stop. We are well aware that he
                        grounded his hope of temporary success on considerations outside of the
                        returns, and vainly dreams that because he was anxious to dispose of his
                        vote for the constitutional amendment, he may be able to crawl in this
                        session long enough to draw mileage and pay. The General made one grievous
                        mistake in that operation. There were men in Congress willing enough to have
                        him cast one righteous vote in the course of a congressional term, but when
                        Gen. Coffroth supposed that he could get them to a corrupt bargain to
                        sanction a monstrous fraud upon the 16th district, he reckoned badly. When
                        he started on that mission, he went wooling with a moral certainty of coming
                        home sheared, as he will learn by and by. We doubt not that a few
                        Republicans gave him indefinite promises, predicated upon his false
                        statement of the merits of his case, but they may be regarded as selling
                        "short" for future delivery, and as the stock can't now be had, they can
                        only be called upon to settle the difference. They will therefore, we doubt
                        not, qualify Gen. Koontz in a few days as having the prima facia case beyond question, and Gen. Coffroth will realize
                        the "difference" by contesting as long as possible and getting his per diem
                        and mileage when he gets final notice to quit. This now seems to be his
                        chief ambition, and as it will be his last appearance upon the public stage,
                        it will probably be a cheap deliverance.</p>
                    <p>We ask the attention of Congress to this case. It is a wrong to our district
                        to deny us representation. One of the two claimants must be entitled to be
                        sworn as mentioned that Gen. Koontz received a clear majority of the vote
                        cast, and that no power but Congress, in a contest, can reject any part of
                        the vote so returned, it is clearly the duty of the House to qualify Gen.
                        Koontz and allow Gen. Coffroth to contest if he has a fancy that way. If
                        something must be done for Coffroth, let it not be done by a crushing wrong
                        upon the loyal men of the 16th district.</p>
