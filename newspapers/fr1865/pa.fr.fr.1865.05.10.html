<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>War has fulfilled its terrible arbitrament. Victor and vanquished are
                        accepted terms throughout the whole crimsoned theatre of the sanguinary
                        strife. The mission of the sword is ended--that of Pacification has begun.
                        What monuments shall mark its history? Shall it be fruitful of peace and
                        tranquility? Shall it bring a cemented brotherhood made sacred by its
                        fearful baptism in fraternal blood? Shall it be peace and union from
                        sympathy and conviction?--from enmity schooled by mingled power and
                        magnanimity to veneration for our common Nationality? Or shall it be the
                        calm of death; the sweep of vengeance; the painful stillness of despotic
                        might, which deepen hatreds, intensify the horrors of submission, and plant
                        anew the seeds of disorder and perfidy to weaken the power and beset the
                        pathway of the Republic?</p>
                    <p>Since the Nation was plunged into the profoundest grief by the assassination
                        of our venerated Chief Magistrate, we have purposely refrained from any
                        allusion to the absorbing question as to the policy of the government in
                        dealing with its millions of criminals. We have left to others the easy task
                        of demanding the fullest measure of vengeance. Our own columns last week
                        gave a warning voice from the sacred desk, that the pound of flesh was so
                        denominated in the bond, and must be taken; and again to-day a communication
                        shows how easily it is for even intelligent men to mistake vengeance for the
                        administration of public justice. If we should prefer to minister to the
                        passions which the full fruition of treason, as exemplified in the assassin,
                        have naturally engendered, we would doubtless present views acceptable to
                        the major portion of our readers. But such is not the mission of the
                        faithful journalist. Passions and resentments, however fierce and
                        relentless, must fade away. Sooner or later calm reason, and liberal,
                        enlightened judgement must assert their supremacy. The patriotism of the
                        Nation, so long and so sorely tried, will find higher and holier duties than
                        those dictated by vengeance; and justice will reach its grandest triumph as
                        a rescued government proclaims its power and permanency by the generous
                        magnanimity that will go hand in hand with its terrible punishment.</p>
                    <p>Just now the spirit of vengeance is rife throughout the land. It greets us at
                        every step. It comes from almost every voice. It thunders from the pulpit.
                        It is applauded in popular assemblages. All breathe it, feel it, sympathize
                        with it, bow to it. The assassin's hand has stricken the President down, and
                        the demon of treason shouted its appalling triumph over the noble victim.
                        Just when his wisdom and patriotism had made every knee to bow and every
                        tongue confess--just when in the fullness of a Nation's love, he was
                        murdered; and it was treason that nerved the arm and directed the swift
                        instrument of death. For such a crime the Nation has no name, and no penalty
                        is ample for atonements. It has dried up the generous fountains of the
                        popular heart. It has called forth the curse of vengeance throughout the
                        loyal States, and every untimely grave, every withered field and every
                        shadowed circle, seems to join in the demand for bloody retribution.</p>
                    <p>Let us pause in the midst of this mingled sorrow and resentment, and look
                        well at the solemn duties and momentous issues interwoven with the Nation's
                        treatment of a vanquished foe. Not less than three million traitors have
                        given helping hands to the desolation and bereavements of this cruel, wanton
                        war. Judged by every moral standard they are murderers--remorseless
                        fratricides. From their fugitive chief to the humblest in their
                        ranks--soldier and citizen, father and son, matron and maiden, who counseled
                        causeless strife, conceived in perfidy and waged against humanity and
                        government, are alike authors of the bloody drama just closed. Treason swept
                        tornado like over the sunny South, and engulfed whole States in its deadly
                        embrace. The colossal proportions and power of crime gave it conventional
                        dignity. The traitor became a public enemy, and treason was clothed here and
                        throughout the world with belligerent rights. Necessity made it law. For
                        four years we warred as with a foreign foe, and at last the God of battles
                        and of justice has scattered the legions of the treacherous usurper, and
                        given decisive victory to Liberty and Law.</p>
                    <p>The sword has now performed its cruel work. Our Nationality is preserved. Its
                        foundation is unshaken; but its imposing columns are not unscathed. It has
                        broken joints, dismantled ornaments, and gaping scars for time and wisdom to
                        heal. It has States without government, without law, without representation,
                        and with an estranged people, to gather into the folds of the Republic
                        again. They were enemies but yesterday--to-day they are integral parts of
                        our common country. Their legions have scattered with the mercy of a
                        beneficient government recalling them to fidelity. The army of Lee,
                        including its commander the great captain of treason, is disbanded with the
                        plighted faith of the Nation that they shall not die. This was the last
                        great act of our martyred President--it will be recorded as one of his
                        noblest. His successor takes his place, and declares that treason is a crime
                        and must have its penalty. But he means justice--not vengeance. While the
                        sorrowing Nation was bearing its murdered ruler to the tomb, the new
                        Executive accepted the surrender of Johnston and his army. He demanded just
                        what Mr. Lincoln demanded of Lee. He was magnanimous that he might the
                        better be just to the guilty and to the country. He will pardon freely; but
                        punish pitilessly. Few, perhaps none, may give life to vindicate justice in
                        atonement for treason. The surrendered armies of crime are saved by the
                        terms of capitulation. Those who dealt out death in our midst, are exempt
                        from the law that demands life for life. The deluded will be forgiven; the
                        weak and erring will be told to sin no more, while those who betrayed them
                        and sought to give over a continent to bloody anarchy, will drink the cup of
                        justice, and live and drink its embittered draught through weary, aimless,
                        hopeless life. The few who could not live, will hasten to foreign
                        lands--self-banished, self-expatriated. Marked and shunned by all the world,
                        they will be without honor, without home, without country, and still denied
                        refuge of the grave unless as suicides.</p>
                    <p>Of those who remain, to whom a merciful government has granted life, let no
                        one dream that justice in its most terrible form will not follow them.
                        Vengeance will not blot the history of our regenerated Nationality; but
                        stern, relentless justice will pursue its even course and end its inexorable
                        mission only with their death. Lee and Johnston and Beauregard and their
                        lesser comrades have life; but no "mawkish sentimentality" has given them
                        mercy. They are strangers to their country and its institutions. They are
                        aliens to their own homes and property. They are ineligible to the honors of
                        State or Nation. Their own bondmen have become more than their peers. Thus
                        smitten in fortunes, in pride, in honor and in citizenship, they are doomed
                        to live in pitiless scorn, to teach mankind how fearful is the retribution
                        of a magnanimous and mighty Nation. Incapable of good and impotent for evil,
                        it will be theirs to live and witness the growing power and measureless
                        blessings of a disenthralled Republic, hastened to its stainless perfection
                        of Freedom by the madness of their crimes. Such will be the inflexible
                        course of justice. It will make no martyrs. It will bring no stain of
                        vengeance. It will leave no sympathy for treason. It will estrange none from
                        fidelity. It will break not the bruised reed; but it will gather into the
                        folds of our proud inheritance all who, misled by the perfidy and ambition
                        of others, have learned the sad lesson of treason and now give sincere and
                        cordial support to the best of civil governments.</p>
                    <p>The stain of the assassin, whether by act, by counsel, or otherwise, should
                        be the mark of death. The world should be too small to shelter the murderers
                        of a chief ruler. It is a crime against the laws of God, the laws of
                        Nations, and the laws of War. It has nothing to plead in extenuation of it.
                        The code of belligerents pronounces it accursed, and there can be but one
                        atonement to a bereaved people and to mankind. This penalty treason must
                        pay--it is the author of the atrocious deed. Thus far and no farther would
                        we crimson the bright morn of Peace. We would let justice follow those who
                        have been clothed with power to betray States and make people their own and
                        their country's foes. We would have the retributive arm of the government
                        teach them that inordinate ambition for power has made them powerless,
                        citizenless, homeless and friendless--disinherited in a great Nation's
                        patrimony, and left as blotted monuments to prove how basely men may
                        live--how ignobly die. This is the just measure of the Nation's retribution.
                        It will give peace and brotherhood to the faithful, whether they have been
                        unfaltering friends or erring foes. It will so deal justice, inflexible and
                        ceaseless in its terrible mission, that treason and traitors will die
                        dishonored; and the Republic of the Western World will go onward in
                        fulfillment of its destiny for generations to come, as the established
                        citadel of Freedom, regenerated and sustained by an enlightened and noble
                        people, and blessed and protected by a just and beneficent God.</p>

                    <p>THE Spirit, speaking of the proposition to indict
                        the free-booters M'Causland, Gilmore and others and demand their rendition
                        for trial in the civil courts, says:</p>
                    <p>"The District Attorney of Franklin county will be guilty of no such
                        superlative folly. We are acquainted with that official, as well as with
                        some of his ancestors, and feel satisfied that there hasn't been a fool in
                        the family for more than half a century. If the wretches Early, Gilmore,
                        McCausland, Smith and others, can be brought to book for their crimes
                        against our people, it must be done by and through the national authority.
                        County courts are not the proper tribunals to punish such offenders."</p>
                    <p>We presume that the Spirit speaks authoritatively
                        as the recognized organ of the District Attorney, who is also the chairman
                        of the Democratic county committee; but if the bombastic announcement was
                        authorized that officer may learn to regret it. Whether McCausland and his
                        subordinate vandals are belligerents in the sense that would shield them in
                        the criminal courts of Pennsylvania, is a question that the court, and not
                        the District Attorney, may assume to determine; and it is not improbable
                        that the court may differ with the official prosecutor of the county and
                        instruct him to send bills to the grand jury against the men who stand
                        confessedly guilty of the gravest crimes alike against the laws of the State
                        and the laws of war.</p>
                    <p>If there can be no punishment for the atrocities committed by M'Causland and
                        his command, then we should abolish our courts of justice. When and how
                        Pennsylvania acknowledged them as belligerents so that arson, high-way
                        robbery and murder committed by them upon unoffending citizens, cannot be
                        regarded as an offence against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth,
                        and be punished as such, we are at a loss to know; and until the question is
                        judicially determined--not by the flash of bombast of the article we quote
                        from the Spirit, but by the proper legal
                        tribunals, the people will feel that it is at least worthy of the
                        consideration of our courts.</p>
                    <p>It may be possible, as stated by the Spirit, that
                        "there hasn't been a fool in the family" of the District Attorney "for more
                        than half a century;" but if it is authority as to his actions in this case,
                        the friends would do well to remember that even after fifty "years of
                        failure," there may be a notable exception to the rule.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>THE CATTLE LAW.--We have received many inquiries and some complaints in
                        reference to the provisions of the new law prohibiting cattle, horses, sheep
                        and swine from running at large in this county. The law is widely
                        misunderstood. It is not an essential departure from the principle of the
                        law that has been in existence for many years; but it differs in its details
                        of execution. It has been the law of all the leading agricultural counties
                        for several years past, and no community that has tried it would be without
                        it. Of course there are men who love to grumble, and if their way to heaven
                        was smoothed by any new plan, they would grumble still. There are others who
                        complain because it denies them the right to subsist their stock on their
                        neighbors, regardless of the loss inflicted thereby; and it is possible that
                        there are some who misunderstand the law and its operations.</p>
                    <p>Stock at large are the common pests and foes of successful and thrifty
                        agriculture. They are a curse to owners and neighbors. They are illy fed,
                        and poorly repay the trouble and necessary expenses their owners must incur
                        for them, and as a rule they destroy their full value for farmers each year.
                        There is not a cow in or about Chambersburg that forages on the streets and
                        wanders around the skirts of the town, that has not cost the farmers of the
                        vicinity more than the worth of her head each summer season. If we had
                        bought and given away all the town cows four years ago which hitherto have
                        been turned out every morning to hunt their food, and thus secured immunity
                        from their depredations, we should have made money by the operation, and
                        such is the experience, to a greater or less degree of every farmer in this
                        neighborhood. We don't make fences to protect our crops from our own stock,
                        for it is not allowed to go at large; but we have that luxury to guard
                        against the stock of our neighbors, and up to this time have found no fence
                        maker so skillful as to protect grounds securely from their depredations.
                        Hunger knows no law in men or brutes, and farmers find their greatest
                        trouble usually in saving their crops from a few starved cattle which
                        invariably defy all fences and bad droves with them to the work of
                        destruction.</p>
                    <p>It is wrong in principle and in policy to allow stock to wander at will on
                        the public highways. We have seen the lives of more than an hundred people
                        periled a score of times by cattle upon railroads. Such roads cannot be
                        closed against them as the necessities of the public require crossings, and
                        every one should be prohibited, under severe penalties, from thus
                        endangering the lives and limbs of passengers. It is equally pernicious in
                        principle. No man has a right to turn his cattle out to forage upon his
                        neighbors any more than he has to turn his children out before breakfast and
                        tell them to steal their food. Even owners of property are not permitted to
                        use it in their own enjoyment of it so as to do injury to their neighbors,
                        and there is no dictate of policy or justice that warrants constant peril
                        and frequent damage to farmers by stock running at large.</p>
                    <p>The law is far from being oppressive. It does not, as some have represented,
                        prevent the pasturing of cattle in the mountains, as is the habit of many
                        people in their vicinity. It does, however, require an obviously just and
                        proper condition precedent to that. The consent of the owner of the lands to
                        be pastured is necessary, just as it always was, and the risk is then
                        accepted by the proper person to be consulted. The same rule applies
                        everywhere. Any farmer may consent that stock shall run at large on his
                        premises, and the penalties of the law are obviated. We presume that in some
                        sections the evil is not so grave as in others, and in such localities the
                        law will effect little or no change; but it would be best for our
                        agricultural interests that its provisions should be enforced. It will be
                        advantageous to all classes. Men will be amazed to find how cheaply they can
                        keep a cow honestly and well, when they find that they cannot let them have
                        fasts and feasts as they may happen to plunder the neighboring farms. We
                        feed all our cattle from this time until after harvest from the lawn about
                        our house, and feed them well--much better than if they were pastured. It
                        takes less labor than it would require to hunt the wandering stock every
                        day, and they are regularly fed, regularly milked, and with little cost to
                        us and none to our neighbors.</p>
