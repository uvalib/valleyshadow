<b>The Guerilla Moseby</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>An article describes several incidents in Col. Moseby's military career,
                    between 1862 and the end of the war.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Editorial Comment: </font>"The New York World has published a series of interesting articles
                    giving the character and achievements of various rebel leaders. They are written
                    by one of Lee's late staff officers, and must be accepted as coming from one of
                    the strongest rebel proclivities. One of his last contributions is on the
                    ubiquitous Moseby, the great guerilla chief of the Virginia border--the man who
                    periled the safety of every hen-roost, horse stable, money-till, grocery and dry
                    goods store, corn-crib, and larder within his range, and who delighted in
                    stopping railroad trains and robbing every passenger indiscriminately,
                    regardless of age, sex or circumstances, of all monies, watches, jewelry, and
                    other valuables. Of this accomplished free-booter, the World's correspondent
                    thus graphically and kindly writes, and we give it as a matter of of general
                    interest to our readers, who knowing Moseby, will appreciate his history:"<br>

<b>Fast Young Ladies</b><br> (Column 7)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The brief piece warns young women that, should they hope to become "fast
                    young ladies," they must "lay aside all reserve and refinement" and adopt
                    "masculine attire, masculine habits, and masculine modes of expression."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In order to be a fast young lady, it is necessary to lay aside all reserve
                        and refinement--everything that savors of womanly weakness; to have no
                        troublesome scruples, but to be ready to accord an appreciating smile to the
                        broadest joke. There must be no feeling of dependence on the stronger sex;
                        but, by adopting, as far as decency permits, masculine attire, masculine
                        habits, and masculine modes of expression, accompanied by a thorough
                        knowledge of slang, and a fluency in using it, these ladies show themselves
                        to be above all narrow-minded prejudices. There must be no thinking about
                        other people's feelings; if people will be thin skinned, let them keep out
                        of their way at all events. Should "mamma" raise her voice in a feeble
                        remonstrance, the fast young lady impresses upon her that "she is no judge
                        of these matters. In her old school days, everything and every one were
                        slow; but it is quite changed now." In short, to sum up, to be a fast young
                        lady, modesty, delicacy, refinement, respect for superiors, consideration
                        for the aged, must all be set aside; boldness, independence, irreverence,
                        brusqueness, and, we fear, too often heartlessness, must take their
                    place.</p>

<b>Hypocrisy</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In an effort to sway voters to the Republican cause, the editors criticize
                    their counterparts at the Valley Spirit, and Democrats in general, for their
                    about-face since the end of the war. Only a year before, they remind readers,
                    these "hypocrites" were vilifying Lincoln for prosecuting an unjust war and were
                    proclaiming those men who fought for the Union cause to be "pimps, hirelings,
                    and butchers." Now, however, the Democrats are seeking votes by placing soldiers
                    on their ticket and voicing their support for the President.<br>

<b>Republican Retrenchment</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article reports that the national debt has been reduced by close to
                    $1.75 million over the past two months, and attributes the decrease to the
                    policies initiated by Secretary McCulloch.<br>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A notice to the relatives of slain soldiers that they may claim the bodies
                    of their deceased loved-ones after signing an affidavit before a justice of the
                    peace or notary public to the effect that they are authorized to receive said

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A summary of the partial returns from the election, which, according to the
                    latest reports, was won by the Union State ticket (Republican Party) by between
                    8,000 to 10,000 votes. The article also includes the results by district for

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The State</p>
                    <p>We have but partial returns from the State, and they indicate the success of
                        the Union State ticket by from 8,000 to 12,000. Philadelphia gives from
                        3,000 to 4,000; Allegheny 5,000; Lancaster 4,500; Dauphin 1,200. Berks gives
                        5,000 Democratic, Cumberland 500, and scattering reports show uniform
                        Democratic losses in the heavy Democratic counties on the vote of last
                        October. Our last dispatch from Philadelphia, at 1 1/2 this morning, says
                        that the State is regarded as Union by from 8,000 to 12,000, but gives no
                        details. We do not accept this report as conclusive, but we do not see how
                        the result can be against us.</p>
                    <p>Franklin County</p>
                    <p>At the time of going to press (2 A. M., this morning) we have but twelve of
                        the twenty-two districts reported, and they show a Union gain of TWENTY-TWO
                        on the home vote for President last year, when Gen. McClellan had forty-six
                        majority. This leaves twenty-four majority to overcome in the remaining
                        districts, and we cannot even guess as to the result. We hope for a falling
                        off in Letterkenny, Lurgan and Concord, from the crushing Democratic
                        majorities of last year, and a small Union gain in Metal, but we can only
                        surmise.</p>
                    <p>The local ticket runs rather ragged. McClellan gains considerably--probably
                        forty votes--in Chambersburg. Doebler also gains largely here and is pretty
                        certainly elected Sheriff. Kuhn is also elected Surveyor, but the rest of
                        the ticket is in doubt.</p>
                    <p>We have no returns for Assembly excepting from the North Ward, Loudon and St.
                        Thomas, and cannot calculate the result. Col. Stumbaugh will probably lead
                        Tressler from 50 to 100 in the county, and McLellan will lead Stumbaugh
                        probably from 50 to 75. We have no returns from Perry to indicate the vote
                        of the county. Our Representatives are therefore in doubt.</p>
                    <p>Greenvillage is the banner district. She has done most nobly, and had her
                        efforts been imitated throughout the county, the entire Union ticket would
                        now be triumphantly elected.</p>
                    <p>Duncan gains a few votes for Senator and may have a very small majority over
                        M'Conaughy in the county. A dispatch from Gettysburg states that the Union
                        men have made clear gains, but the county is pretty certainly Democratic by
                        100 to 125, so that Duncan's election to the Senate is assured.</p>
                    <p>The following is the vote by districts in the county as far as they are
                        reported, compared with the home vote for President last year:</p>

                    <p>A COMPREHENSIVE scheme for benefitting the South by supplying it with labor
                        has been devised in the East; Governor Andrew, of Massachusetts, being at
                        the head of it. The project contemplates the establishment of a central
                        office in New York, where the owners of land in the slave states can become
                        acquainted with Northern purchasers, and thus a stream of emigration be
                        organized which will fill certain sections of the South with a population
                        having Northern energy and ideas. Branch offices will be instituted in all
                        the former slave States. In this way it is hoped to "reconstruct" the
                        Southern States socially as well as politically. The Southern States
                        themselves are doing something of the same kind, and to the same end. It is
                        proposed in several of them to appoint a State Commissioner, with power to
                        ascertain and advertise all lands for sale, to open information offices, to
                        distribute descriptive pamphlets, and to station emigration agents in the
                        chief ports of Europe.</p>
