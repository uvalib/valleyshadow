<b>Richmond Has Fallen!</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Describes the surrender of Richmond.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>The rebel capital; the last rebel strong-hold, has surrendered to the
						matchless heroism of the Army of the Potomac. The hope so long deferred has
						at last reached the ful[l]ness of fruition, and the soldiers of crime retire
						from their long and stubbornly defended citadel of power, with their last
						army shattered to fragments; with no safety in retreat; no hope in further
						resistance to the overwhelming might of the brave defenders of the Republic.</p>
					<p>Let loyal men rejoice! We have had victories before--the same dauntless
						courage; equal endurance in the defense of the right; but never has a
						triumph been achieved so crowning in the measure of its results--so utterly
						destructive to the country's foes. It leaves them without an army; without a
						government; without credit; without hope. It is the great retributive stroke
						which in the ful[l]ness of His time, has vindicated Humanity and Justice!</p>
					<p>It proclaims the safety of the Republic! Centuries hence, when the heroism of
						the last four years will still be undimmed on the shifting canvass of the
						past, the victories which culminated in the possession of Richmond, will be
						pointed to as the fields where the sons of the North baptized their Freedom
						in their noblest blood, and re-achieved their title to their proud
						inheritance--the best, the most beneficent government on earth.</p>
					<p>All honor to the gallant Army of the Potomac! How nobly it has struggled,
						undaunted by defeat against the choicest troops of the foe, let its
						sacrifices on the Peninsula, at Antietam, at Fredericksburg, at
						Chancellorsville, at Gettysburg, and from the Wilderness to the South-side
						road and Richmond tell. It has made the heroism of all armies in the history
						of warfare pale before its unfaltering courage, and grand achievements; and
						now it fitly crowns the glory of the war by striking the last great blow to
						make treason hated by all the living, and shunned by all who shall live
						hereafter. Gratefully indeed will a long imperiled Nation cherish the noble
						deeds; the patient endurance; the unflagging gallantry of the Army of the
						Potomac, and the memory of its slain--rich sacrifices to the madness of
						treason--will live in perpetual freshness in every patriot heart.</p>
					<p>The Republic is rescued from the murderous grasp of Treason, thanks to a
						faithful North and to a just and beneficent God!</p>

<b>The Niagara Peace Effort</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Details the correspondence between Horace Greeley and Abraham Lincoln which
					began last July. Greeley urged Lincoln to discuss a peaceful end of the war with
					rebel citizens in Canada. The correspondence occurred during a time of Union
					defeats, high casualties, and financial instability.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>We give in another column of to-day's paper a letter written to the President
						in July last, by Mr. Greeley, of the Tribune, on
						the necessity of proposing or receiving terms of adjustment to close the
						war. Important as is everything coming from the pen of the ablest journalist
						and one of the most intelligent and experienced politicians of the Nation,
						this letter of Mr. Greeley possesses especial importance, because of the
						fact that it was the opening of a correspondence that resulted in the
						memorable letter of Mr. Greeley possesses especial importance, because of
						the fact that it was the opening of a correspondence that resulted in the
						memorable letter of President Lincoln, addressed "To Whom it May Concern,"
						and proposing terms of peace for the consideration of certain rebel leaders
						then in Canada.</p>
					<p>The remarkable letter of the President borne by Maj. Hay to be delivered to
						Messrs. Sanders, Clay and Holcombe, prominent rebel civilians then at
						Niagara, as it then appeared in the public prints without any explanation of
						the circumstances which called it forth, astounded the Nation, and staggered
						many of the truest friends of the administration. Few condemned, but there
						were few who did not regret that such a letter had been written and so
						delivered, as it appeared to afford the rebel leaders the very pretext they
						most desired to "fire the Southern heart," and unite their desponding and
						divided people in support of the rebellion. All the public knew was that
						Messrs. Clay, Holcomb and Sanders were in Canada; that they had been visited
						by prominent Democratic politicians--such as Hon. Jere. S. Black, Gov.
						Bigler, Senator Buckaiew and others of this State; that a crazy adventurer
						named Jewett had been peddling peace propositions to and from everybody with
						whom he could get audience; but in all this there was no visible motive for
						a declaration from Mr. Lincoln in the midst of a Presidential struggle, of
						terms of adjustment which the rebels would most certainly then reject, and
						which might weaken, but could not possibly strengthen the administration and
						its cause.</p>
					<p>We are glad that the letter of Mr. Greeley has found its way into the public
						prints. How it happened to come to us by way of England--as it first
						appeared in the ManchesterExaminer--is of no
						consequence. It is enough that it is now public property; that the door to
						the secret working of the Niagara Peace effort has been unlocked, and we may
						now learn the whole history of that comedy of errors. Mr. Greeley opened the
						correspondence on the subject with the letter we print to-day, and it will
						be observed how earnest is the tone that pervades his sentences in behalf of
						peace. He sought peace not because it would have been right in the abstract,
						or because such a peace was then attainable as the Nation and its great
						cause should command; but he earnestly sought peace to save "fresh
						conscriptions;" "further wholesale devastations;" "new rivers of human
						blood," and to save some little of "our bleeding, bankrupt, almost dying
						country." These considerations in connection with "the momentous election
						soon to occur in North Carolina" and the "draft to be enforced in the Free
						States," induce Mr. Greely to demand, in the most positive terms that Mr.
						Lincoln should do something to prove to all, loyal and disloyal, that he was
						not prosecuting war merely for the love of war.</p>
					<p>This letter was written in July last--just at the darkest period of the year;
						when gloom hung over the Nation like a pall, paralyzing its energies and
						wasting its hopes. Grant had reached the James without decisive results,
						after an appalling sacrifice of life; Sherman had been fought at every step
						from Chattanooga on his perilous march to Atlanta, and his success was
						deemed more than doubtful; new levies had to be ordered to save the
						country's cause; our credit was more depressed than ever before, and the
						shrewdest of politicians confessed the Presidential contest lost miles saved
						to Mr. Lincoln by the folly of his foes, as it was by the Chicago platform.
						It was, under these circumstances that Mr. Greely wrote, and he was
						evidently prepared for peace on almost any terms that would save us a
						respectable semblance of government, and he insisted that unless terms were
						proposed, or notice given that terms would be received and considered, all
						was inevitably lost. The Tribune was then as now
						the most powerful political organ of the Nation, and an expression in its
						columns of the convictions of its chief editor as given to Mr. Lincoln in
						the letter in question, would have been a confession of hopeless
						discomfiture alike in the pending political struggle, and in the attempts to
						preserve the Union by an appeal to the arburament [sic] of the sword.</p>
					<p>So much the public are now advised of by Mr. Greeley's letter; but the whole
						story is far from being told. No public explanation of the "To Whom It May
						Concern" letter was made by the President, because it could not be done
						without giving to the world Mr. Greeley's first letter, in which there were
						such sad, and as events have proved, such groundless confessions of
						political and National weakness. Such a letter published at any time before
						November 1864, would have been the most potent political document the
						Vallandighams and Woods could have circulated, and it would have been worth
						a corps to the insurgent army. It could not therefore, be given to the
						world, and without it there could be no explanation of the series of events
						which led the President to startle the country by proposing terms of
						adjustment to the rebel citizens in Canada. But now the Nation can afford to
						have the whole history of this bungling diplomacy, and we trust that it will
						be speedily given to the public. Some twenty letters and dispatches passed
						between the President and Mr. Greeley on the subject before the President
						consented to take the step proposed and then, as his letters and dispatches
						will show, he did it with the extremest reluctance, without hope of its
						success, and accepted it only as a lesser evil than have so powerful an
						organ as theTribune practically surrender the
						Presidential election and the war.</p>
					<p>When the entire correspondence shall be published, as we doubt not it will at
						an early day, it will be seen that the President fully vindicated himself
						for refusing Mr. Stephens safe conduct to Washington, and that he clearly
						foresaw the result that attended his proposition, but as a necessity he
						accepted the condition imposed, and framed his terms of adjustment in
						substantial accordance with Mr. Greeley's suggestions. In other words, he
						proposed such terms of peace as Mr. Greeley who plead the claims of the
						informal rebel commission as to [illegible] proposition laid down for his
						guidance and such as Mr. Greeley evidently believed and affirmed would prove
						acceptable to the Southern people.</p>
					<p>It is now due alike to Mr. Greeley, to the President and to the country that
						the entire correspondence be given to the public, and we hope to see it
						published in a very few days. When it shall appear many who censured
						President Lincoln for the course he was induced to take will feel that he
						acted then, as ever, with enlightened judgment and unfaltering fidelity to
						our imperiled government.</p>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>New York, July 7, 1864</p>
					<p>My Dear Sir: I venture to inclose you a letter and telegraphic dispatch that
						I received yesterday from our irrepressible friend Colorado Jewett, at
						Niagara Falls. I think they deserve attention. Of course I do not indorse
						Jewett's positive averment that his friends at the Falls have "full powers"
						from J.D., though I do not doubt that he thinks they have. I let that
						statement stand as simply evidencing the anxiety of the confederates
						everywhere for peace. So much is beyond doubt.</p>
					<p>And therefore I venture to remind you that our bleeding, bankrupt, almost
						dying country also longs for peace--shudders at the prospect of fresh
						conscriptions, of further wholesale devastations, and of new rivers of human
						blood; and a wide-spread conviction that the Government and its prominent
						supporters are not anxious for peace, and cannot improve proffered
						opportunities to achieve it, is doing great harm now, and is morally
						certain, unless removed, to do far greater in the approaching elections.</p>
					<p>It is not enough that we anxiously desire a true and lasting peace; we ought
						to demonstrate and establish the truth beyond cavil. The fact that A.H.
						Stephens was not permitted a year ago to visit and confer with the
						authorities at Washington, has done harm, which the tone at the late
						National Convention at Baltimore is not calculated to counteract.</p>
					<p>I entreat you, in your own time and manner, to submit overtures for
						pacification to the Southern insurgents, which the impartial must pronounce
						frank and generous. If only with a view to the moment[o]us election soon to
						occur in North Carolina, and of the draft to be enforced in the Free States,
						this should be done at once. I would give the safe conduct required by the
						Rebel envoys at Niagara, upon their parole to avoid observation and to
						refrain from all communication with their sympathizers in the loyal States;
						but you may see reasons for declining it. But whether through them or
						otherwise, do not, I entreat you, fail to make the Southern people
						comprehend that you, and all of us, are anxious for peace, and prepared to
						grant liberal terms. I venture to suggest the following</p>
					<p>Plan of Adjustment.<br>1. The Union is restored and declared
						perpetual.<br>2. Slavery is utterly and forever abolished throughout the
						same.<br>3. A complete amnesty for all political offences, with a
						restoration of all the inhabitants of each State to all the privileges of
						citizens of the United States.<br>4. The Union to pay four hundred million
						dollars ($400,000,000) in five per cent United States stock to the late
						Slave States, loyal and secession alike, to be apportioned pro rata, according to their Slave population
						respectively, by the census of 1860, in compensation for the losses of their
						loyal citizens by the abolition of Slavery. Each state is to be entitled to
						its quota upon the ratification by its Legislature of this adjustment. The
						bonds to be at the absolute disposal of the Legislature afor[e]said.</p>
					<p><br>5. The said Slave States to be entitled henceforth to representation in
						the House on the basis of their total, instead of their Federal population,
						the whole now being free.<br>6. A National Convention to be assembled so
						soon as may be, to ratify this adjustment, and make such changes in the
						Constitution as may be deemed advisable.</p>
					<p>Mr. President, I fear you do not realize how intently the people desire any
						Peace consistent with the National Integrity and honor, and how joyously
						they would hail its achievement, and bless its authors. With United States
						stocks worth but 40 cents in gold per dollar, and drafting about to commence
						on the third million of Union soldiers, can this be wondered at?</p>
					<p>I do not say that a just Peace is now attainable, though I believe it to be
						so. But I do say that a frank offer by you to the insurgents of terms which
						the impartial world say ought to be accepted will at the worst, prove an
						immense and sorely needed advantage to the National cause. It may save us us
						[sic] from a Northern insurrection.</p>
					<p>Yours truly, Horace Greeley.</p>
					<p>Hon. A. Lincoln, President, Washington, D.C.</p>
					<p>P.S.--Even though it should be deemed unadvisable to make an offer of terms
						to the Rebels, I insist that, in any possible case, it is desirable that any
						offer they may be disposed to make should be received, and either accepted
						or rejected. I beg you to invite those now at Niagara to exhibit their
						credentials and submit their ultimatum.</p>
					<p>H.G.</p>
