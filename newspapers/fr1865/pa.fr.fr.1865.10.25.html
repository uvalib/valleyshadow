<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Although all of the ballots have not been tabulated, because the votes of

                    say the editors. Another reason for reexamining the result, they claim, is that
                    at least fifty deserters cast votes in the contest (all for Duncan), despite
                    being disfranchised as mandated by a congressional act.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The second meeting of the return judges will take place on Friday next, when
                        the army vote returned to the Prothonotaries will be added to the home vote,
                        and the certificate of election awarded thereon. It is probable that the
                        return from the 77th Pennsylvania regiment will not be received in time for
                        the meeting of the judges on Friday, and it cannot be available thereafter
                        to give Mr. M'Conaughy the certificate.</p>
                    <p>We assume therefore that Mr. Duncan will be given the certificate of election
                        as our Senator, which will make him prima facia
                        Senator elect and entitle him to be qualified and take the seat when the
                        legislature meets. No amount of majority returned against him to the
                        Prothonotaries after Friday next would avail to change Mr. Duncan's right to
                        be sworn at the organization of the Senate, but all such votes, however
                        informally cast or at whatever period returned to the Prothonotary, if they
                        are returns of polls honestly conducted, will be accepted and the seat
                        ultimately given to the candidate who has received a majority of the legal
                        votes.</p>
                    <p>We are assured that not less than fifty deserters voted in this Senatorial
                        district, and of that number, not five, most likely not one, voted for Mr.
                        M'Conaughy. The Union men with one accord asked that the laws be enforced as
                        they are, without inviting every election officer to determine their
                        constitutionality and there was every inducement for such men to vote the
                        Democratic ticket. We do not speak advisedly of the votes cast in the
                        different districts of that class, but we do not err in fixing the aggregate
                        number at fifty, while Mr. Duncan's majority will not be over twenty, if it
                        is even so much. Under such circumstances Mr. McConaughy will owe it to the
                        Union men of the district and to the violated laws, as well as to himself,
                        to contest the seat on the ground that his competitor has an apparent
                        majority made up of men who have forfeited their citizenship by their
                        perfidy to their country in its hour of trial. Whether additional army
                        returns shall elect Mr. M'Conaughy or not after the certificate is awarded,
                        we hope to see this issue put squarely to the Senate and the fact
                        established that skulking conscripts controlled the election in the
                        district. It will be well for the present and future elections to know that
                        such men returned from their hiding places after our institutions have been
                        saved in spite of their treachery, and now seek to attain by their votes
                        what their cowardice failed to accomplish. The same rule will apply to the
                        case of Col. Rowe, who will, we trust, proceed in court and test the
                        question there.</p>
                    <p>Contested seats in the Senate are determined by a committee of seven, we
                        believe, drawn by the clerk. The names of all the Senators but the member
                        whose seat is contested and the speaker are written on slips of paper,
                        carefully folded and placed in a box. They are then drawn out one at a time,
                        the ticket opened and the name read out, when either party can challenge
                        peremptorily until a given number remain--13 we believe. The contestants
                        with their counsel then retire and strike off one name alternatively until
                        the requisite number remain. They constitute the committee, and their report
                        is final and cannot be reversed by the Senate.</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>It is reported a deserter, Henry Riley, of Hamilton township, has filed a
                    suit against the local judge of election in his district for refusing his vote,
                    in accordance with the bill passed by Congress. The article welcomes this
                    development since there seems to be considerable disagreement throughout the

                    Meyers, and other Democratic leaders "persuaded" return judges in Bedford,
                    Fulton, and Adams counties to reject a sufficient number of soldiers' votes to
                    guarantee a Democratic victory. Once the fraud was exposed, however, the results

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>ONE year ago the Democratic candidates for Congress and Judge in this
                        district, and the candidates on the same ticket for Assembly in the Bedford
                        district, were all defeated by clear majorities by the soldier vote; but
                        Messrs. Coffroth, Meyers &amp; Co. resolved to accomplish by fraud what
                        they could not attain by a fair vote, and they persuaded the Democratic
                        return judges of Bedford, Fulton and Adams, in violation of the express
                        terms of the law, to reject just enough of the army vote to give them
                        apparent majorities. The House of Representatives summarily throttled the
                        fraud, admitted the Union members, and left the Democratic candidates to
                        contest, which they very prudently declined to do, as they were unwilling to
                        have their frauds officially exposed. Coffroth, however, who never knows
                        when a farce is played out, still imagines that he has some chance for
                        crawling into Congress, but he will shortly be a wiser and probably a sadder
                        man. The people have for the first time since this fraud was attempted, had
                        an opportunity to vindicate themselves, and they have done it most
                        effectually. Adams has elected a Union member by 16 majority, and Bedford,
                        Fulton, and Somerset gave the following official vote for members:</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>No. XXXIV.] Harrisburg, October 23, 1865</p>
                    <p>The result of the late election has turned various political tables and
                        crushed many political hopes. The large majority of 20,000 for the Union
                        candidates in a comparatively unimportant contest, leaves the Democracy
                        hopeless. It settles the next Governor and the next United States Senator
                        against them. They were even more confident than the Union men of success in
                        the contest just closed. They believed their organization to be much better
                        than ours, and I doubt not that it was as good, and they had scarcely a
                        doubt of success; but their strong Democratic counties failed them utterly
                        and they cannot now calculate with any certainty that next year will improve
                        their condition. They condemn the "quiet campaign," and charge Mr. Wallace
                        with failure on that account; but had they made an active canvas they would
                        have been beaten ten thousand more. The truth is apparent that they lost the
                        State because of the earnest, profound convictions of the people that they
                        have been wrong throughout the war and cannot be right now.</p>
                    <p>The decisive majority secured in the Senate for the Union men this year
                        renders it certain beyond all contingency that there will be a Union
                        legislature in 1867. Even allowing Duncan his seat in the Senate stands 20
                        Union to 13 Democrats, leaving a majority of 7. But it is confidently
                        expressed that Mr. M'Conaughy will get his seat. If the army vote fails to
                        elect him, a contest would doubtless eject Mr. Duncan, as it is well known
                        that in certain portions of the district, particularly in Adams, many
                        deserters voted for Mr. Duncan; and in the face of the act of Congress the
                        Senate would not allow such votes to prevail. With Mr. M'Conaughy admitted,
                        the Senate will stand 21 to 12--making the Union majority 9. Next year the
                        Union men are certain to gain one in place of Hopkins in Washington and
                        Beaver, and none of the other districts can be considered doubtful, so that
                        the Senate of 1867 will, according to all rational calculations, stand 22 to
                        11, leaving the Democrats in a minority of 11. If they should carry the
                        State by 40,000 for Governor, they could not overcome that majority in the
                        House; but all signs of the times must prove deceptive if the House does not
                        have from 20 to 30 Union majority also.</p>
                    <p>The next Senator will therefore certainly be a Union man, and already the
                        contest is becoming animated. There will be not less than a score of
                        candidates and much bitterness will mingle in the struggle. Gen. Cameron has
                        labored untiringly since his retirement from the cabinet for the position,
                        and will exhaust his energies to attain it. He has just emerged from a
                        contest at home with victory on his banner, and feels he can now devote his
                        energies to other sections. Philadelphia will present not less than two
                        candidates, both of whom are, next to being for themselves, against Cameron.
                        I refer to Col. Wm. B. Thomas and Hon. Wm. D. Kelly. Judge Kelly is
                        especially bitter against Cameron and will deal some heavy blows in the
                        progress of the struggle. Gov. Curtin is widely spoken of, but I do not know
                        that he regards himself as a candidate. Certain it is that he has not
                        devoted his efforts to control the election of members of the legislature
                        favorable to himself. Hon. Thaddeus Stevens is named, but I do not regard it
                        as probable that he will enter the list of competitors. Hon. G. A. Grow will
                        probably be a formidable candidate as the whole North would adhere to him
                        with great fidelity. The West will, of course, have a small crop of
                        candidates also; but as Cowan has the position now, it is likely that the
                        Senator will be yielded to the East. A decided majority of the new Senators
                        chosen this fall are squarely hostile to Gen. Cameron, and the Chester,
                        Lancaster, Bedford and Beaver districts will pretty certainly elect Senators
                        next fall who will not prefer him. He has, however, earnest friends in Hall,
                        Haines and Nichols, who will probably be re-elected, and Ridgeway will
                        likely support him if Philadelphia cannot carry one of her candidates
                        through. Unless the House shall be made strongly for Cameron--much more so
                        than it is this year--he cannot be the nominee of the Union caucus; but just
                        who may be is a question that is most difficult of solution.</p>
                    <p>Naturally enough the overwhelming Union victory just achieved has brought out
                        a large crop of candidates for Governor. Gen. Morehead, of Allegheny, Col.
                        Jordan of Bedford, Gen. Geary and Hon. Jno. Covode, of Westmoreland, Hon. W.
                        W. Ketcham, of Luzerne, have been known candidates for some months, and the
                        established supremacy of the Union party will make their friends increase
                        their energies. In addition to these, I bear the names of Hon. Thos. M. Howe
                        and Hon. Jno. P. Penny, of Allegheny, General Lemuel Todd, of Cumberland,
                        Mayor M'Michael, of Philadelphia, Gen. Hartrantt, and Gen. Hancock, of
                        Montgomery, Hon. G. A. Grow, of Susquehanna, Senator Lowery, of Erie, Hon.
                        Geo. V. Lawrence, of Washington, Hon. John Cessna, of Bedford, and others
                        whose names I do not now recall. The name of the chief editor of the
                        REPOSITORY has also been pretty freely used in connection with the
                        nomination; but as his own columns peremptorily decline him, I presume that
                        I am bound to obey and strike his name from the list. Of the new names
                        suggested, that of Mr. Cessna has the most vitality; and it is probable that
                        there will be a powerful concentration in his favor. He has made a most
                        gallant fight for the country since the day the war was commenced, and has
                        never blotted his record by faltering under any circumstances; and the
                        consummate skill and energy with which he won victory for the party in the
                        late contest, gives him a prestige that courses to fortune with a strong
                        tide. If a military man must be taken, Gen. Hancock would doubtless bear off
                        the prize if he is willing to accept it; but a brevet Maj. General in the
                        regular army would hesitate long before exchanging a life office in the line
                        of his profession and in which he had won all his fame, for the uncertain
                        fortunes of political life.</p>
                    <p>Gov. Curtin has just signalized his devotion to the soldiers again by
                        appointing Col. Clark to the position of Master Warden of Philadelphia, in
                        place of Mr. Wayne deceased, and by installing a wounded private as
                        messenger in place of Mr. Miles deceased. Enduring as the monumental marble
                        which attests our heroism and sacrifices on so many sanguinary fields, will
                        be the grateful remembrance of Gov. Curtin's tireless efforts in behalf of
                        our brave soldiery, by them and their posterity.<br> HORACE</p>
