<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository's correspondent describes the state of Virginia's capital
                    and its hinterland, much of which, he avers, lays in ruin. The blaze that
                    destroyed large sections of the city, causing $30,000,000 worth of damage was
                    ignited by the Confederates as they retreated.<br>

<b>Seed Wheat</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Responding to queries from farmers as to which seed they should plant, the
                    editors recommend the use of the Lancaster variety. In light of the destruction
                    caused by the weevil last harvest, this decision has taken on an increased
                    importance.<br>

<b>The Vandal McCausland</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>It is reported that Gen. McCausland, the officer in command when
                    Chambersburg was sacked and burned to the ground, has fled to Canada, thus
                    placing in doubt the likelihood that he will face justice for his "crimes"
                    during the war. In spite of the information, report the editors, the Federal
                    Cavalry continues to search for him, due in large measure to an incident that
                    occurred near the closing of the war in which he executed one of Gen. Grant's
                    staff officers who had been taken prisoner. "Hated and shunned by loyalists and
                    traitors in his own land," they say, he has become "a wanderer and outcast" with
                    no one to turn to.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The grand jury of Franklin county returned a true bill on the 16th inst.,
                        against Jos. A. M'Causland--late general in the rebel army, and the officer
                        in command when Chambersburg was sacked and burned--for arson and high-way
                        robbery; and Gov. Curtin promptly issued his requisition upon Gov. Boreman,
                        of West Virginia, for the rendition of McCausland to the civil authorities
                        of this county. Gov. Boreman responded to the demand of Gov. Curtin and
                        rendered every possible facility to aid in the arrest of the fugitive; but a
                        careful recognizance of his old residence and neighborhood developed the
                        fact that he had fled to Canada some two months ago. Ever after his
                        atrocities in Chambersburg, his command ceased to be soldiers--were useless
                        save as free-booters, and some of the gravest disasters suffered by Early in
                        the Valley were with some justice attributed by Early and the rebel press to
                        the thieving cowards of M'Causland's command. Before the war closed the
                        chief vandal and his men were as cordially despised by the rebels as they
                        were by the North, and when Lee surrendered, M'Causland found himself
                        without a resting place. He was paroled under the stipulations of Lee's
                        capitulation, and went to his old home near Point Pleasant, West Virginia,
                        but no voice of welcome greeted him, and nought but execration or studied
                        contempt confronted him wherever he directed his steps. Conscious of his
                        guilt against every principle of humanity, and constantly haunted with the
                        fear that he should be brought to meet the avenging arm of justice in
                        Chambersburg, he finally fled by way of Cincinnatti, Cleveland, and St.
                        Louis to Canada, where he has taken his abode as the only "sequestered spot"
                        that can shield him from the terrible retribution his crimes have invited.</p>
                    <p>We have hitherto, for obvious reasons, refrained from giving publicity to a
                        fragment of M'Causland's history that we received from confidential but
                        entirely reliable sources some six weeks ago; but as the Federal cavalry
                        have been in search of him at his own home, he cannot now be ignorant of the
                        purpose of the government to bring him to justice, and we can with propriety
                        state that there is an order of the War Department commanding his arrest by
                        the military authorities. When Lee was retreating from Richmond, McCausland
                        was with him, commanding a brigade of cavalry and aiding to cover the rear
                        of the army. At Farmville several wounded Union prisoners were brought into
                        the rebel lines where McCausland commanded, and among them was one of
                        Lieutenant General Grant's staff officers. McCausland greeted him with a
                        volley of profanity, and crowned his wanton insults to a captured foe by
                        deliberately murdering him with his own sword. No provocation whatever was
                        offered by the wounded officer, who was then a prisoner of war; but
                        M'Causland, true to his fiendish instincts, murdered him before his own
                        command. Information of this atrocity was communicated to us by an ex-rebel
                        officer who had been here in one of the rebel raids in which the humanities
                        of war were duly observed, and he gave the names of several rebel officers
                        who witnessed the brutal murder and authorized their names and residence to
                        be communicated to the government. This information was of course furnished
                        to the authorities, and an order was promptly issued for M'Causland's
                        arrest. The cavalry of West Virginia proceeded at once to Point Pleasant,
                        but the vandal had already fled. Since then an order has been issued to the
                        commander of every military department in the Union for his arrest, and Gov.
                        Boreman of his own State is ready at any time to arrest him for rendition to
                        the civil authorities of this county. Such is the fate of the traitor,
                        vandal and murderer M'Causland. Hated and shunned by loyalists and traitors
                        in his own land, and pursuing vengeance shadowing his pathway at every step,
                        he is a wanderer and outcast--a stranger to home, to country and to
                        friendship, as he crouched beneath the reluctant hospitality of a government
                        that now hates his cause since it won only discomfiture. Truly--<br> "The
                        mills of the Gods grind slowly<br> But they grind exceeding fine!"</p>

<b>Philadelphia</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository's correspondent relates that the Nominating Convention for
                    the Union Party provoked a stir in the "second city" last week. Much of the
                    strife, he contends, was caused by the delegates failure to place former
                    soldiers on the party's ticket, as several counties around the state, including
                    Franklin, had done. As a result, a faction within the party has threatened to
                    bolt the organization and work against its nominees for Mayor and City
