                    <p>At last the Nation is disenthralled from its crowning crime. Slavery, the
                        fruitful parent of all the staggering woes of the Republic--the deadly foe
                        of the very genius of our free institutions, and the author of the bloody
                        fraternal conflict that has crimsoned our fair fields by the most
                        appal[l]ing sacrifices, has, in the fulness of His time, fallen beneath the
                        retributive stroke of Justice, and before the close of the year, it is
                        morally certain that the last stain of Human Bondage will be erased from our
                        National escutcheon.</p>
                    <p>Elsewhere in to-day's paper we give the details of the passage by Congrass
                        [sic] of a resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the
                        United States abolishing Slavery in the several States and all the territory
                        within the jurisdiction of the government. It passed the Senate months ago,
                        but failed to secure the requisite two-thirds in the popular branch. Since
                        then the peeple [sic] have solemnly decided in a great civil struggle that
                        Slavery should not survive the fearful conflict it so wickedly inaugurated,
                        and the same Congress that rejected this proposed amendment in 1864, bows to
                        the expressed will of the Nation, and now has adopted it amidst the earnest
                        applaudits of the people of the Christian world.</p>
                    <p>To make it a part of the organic law, it must be ratified by three fourths of
                        all the States of the Union. Already quite a number have done so, among the
                        first of which was the approving voice of our own mighty Commonwealth, and
                        we cannot doubt that before the close of the year, and it may be before many
                        months, the action of Congress at once and forever abolishing Slavery will
                        be ratified with all the ceremony of law, and the great Republic of the
                        Earth will be, in fact as in theory, the faithful exponent of Human Freedom.</p>
                    <p>The success of this measure in Congress was due to a number of Democrats who
                        have disregarded the behests of party to preserve the life of the Republic.
                        Among these the name of Gen. A. H. Coffroth is found, and his vote is
                        severely criticised by his former friends. We could not refrain from
                        exposing the folly of Gen. Coffroth's speech against the success of this
                        amendment delivered during the last session, and if in our animadversions
                        thereon we have contributed to the change, we have done the General a
                        kindness of no common magnitude. It is freely alleged that Gen. Coffroth
                        cast the vote in question with the hope of thereby securing his seat as
                        against Gen. Koontz; but we cannot sanction such an imputation against the
                        integrity of our Democratic Representative. General Coffroth is <emph
                            rend="italic">not</emph> elected to the next Congress, and he knows it,
                        as does every Union member of Congress who knows anything on the subject,
                        and inasmuch as we feel assured that the Union Congressmen would not be a
                        party to any such disreputable compact, we regard it as most unfair to Gen.
                        Coffroth to allege that he was so influenced in his official acts. It is
                        enough for us to know that Gen. Coffroth has cast a most righteous vote, and
                        in the absence of a palpably manifest dishonorable motive, he is entitled to
                        full credit for it. He will soon retire from official position, in obedience
                        to the voice of the people of his district, and when the charges of the
                        unscrupulous men who but recently sustained him have been forgotten, he will
                        live in history as one of the men who aided in consummating the greatest
                        moral victory achieved in the history of Nations.</p>

                    intelligent, virtuous, industrious, they will prove a great blessing to
                    themselves and the nation."</excerpt>
                <transcript>
                    <p>Since the skies of our national horizon are beginning to look bright, and the
                        dark and threatening clouds of war disappearing, the question is often
                        asked, what shall be done with the freedmen? We confess the question easier
                        asked than answered, yet it may be never so difficult, it must be answered,
                        and that too, in a way becoming a free intelligent and christian people.
                        Whilst the war lasts, but one duty remains, that is, to keep up our armies
                        to their full complement, and supply them with every thing necessary to
                        prosecute the war vigorously and successfully. We have Generals the ablest
                        and bravest in the world, and who have the full confidence of the people.
                        The last election was but a warrant to them from the people to use all means
                        necessary to suppress the rebellion, and conquer a lasting and permanent
                        peace. This they are doing as fast as the most sanguine could ask. Victory
                        everywhere perches proudly upon our banners and as the southern traitors are
                        yielding and our armies marching unmolested through their borders; the civil
                        authorities are tacstly [sic] seeking terms of compromise and peace
                        honorable to themselves if possible. Whilst the affairs in the field stand
                        so favorable, we find nearly one million of freedmen, and the number daily
                        increasing, accessible to the people of the loyal States. They are ignorant,
                        stupid in many cases, and passive recipients of the first influences which
                        strike them. The transition from slavery to freedmen has doubtless jostled
                        their minds a little, and developed new hopes and desires, and prepared them
                        to hear and think as they never could before. The proper instruction will
                        elevate them rapidly--wrong influence will make them more miserable than
                        they were before emancipation. If we do not carry them light, truth,
                        strength and courage, they will inevitably sink under the flood tide of
                        vices which follow an army. Their usefulness has been fairly tested, they
                        have entered the ranks, have shown good capacity in acquiring knowledge
                        sufficient to make good soldiers, and at Fort Wagner; in front of Petersburg
                        and elsewhere, they have shown themselves equal to the best soldiers. No one
                        who speaks dispassionately upon the subject will say that they will not make
                        courageous and available soldiers. They have on more than one occasion
                        received the commendation of their Generals for valuable and efficient
                        services.</p>
                    <p>That they make good mechanics is fairly proven by the fact, that many of them
                        are such, even in the degraded condition of Slavery. They are found in
                        almost every one of the rougher trades, and skilled equal to any even of our
                        own race, who labor in the same occupations. In many parts of the South, it
                        was no unusual thing for planters, to have all the necessary mechanics among
                        his slaves, and the slaves were valued according to their skill in whatever
                        trade they were taught. They are proverbial for their powers of imitation.
                        They are as a general thing fond of music and acquire it easily, and always
                        where they have the least opportunity become excellent performers. We find
                        even some without the advantages of instruction, or much opportunity for
                        practice become quite proficient.</p>
                    <p>But we need not stop here, we find them entering the learned and honorable
                        professions. We have them in the ministry, and doing much honor to the
                        profession. We have them in the profession of medicine, editing newspapers,
                        and but a few days since on motion of Hon. Charles Sumner, one Brooks was
                        admitted to practice law in the Supreme court of the United States. This man
                        Brooks is admitted to be gifted with extraordinary intellectual powers, and
                        although young in years, stands at the head of the profession he has chosen
                        for himself.</p>
                    <p>What then shall be done with the freedmen? Shall we allow them to look out
                        for themselves and provide for their wants as best they can? Shall we keep
                        open our stables and employ them as ostlers, use them as waiters at our
                        dining tables, servants anywhere and everywhere? Or shall we colonize them
                        and send them to some other part of the globe, as an inferior and useless
                        race. No, none of these. There is a higher duty required of us, and our own
                        national salvation demands it. We must come to their help, and pour in upon
                        them the inspiration of a higher and better life; they must be taught to
                        read and write, under the tuition of religious teachers, and in this way,
                        they will be elevated very rapidly and enjoy the blessings of liberty.</p>
                    <p>We are bound by many considerations to come to their help. They are a part of
                        our fallen race, and from this part, we are required by the spirit and aim
                        of the religion we profess to save all the lost that is possible. They have
                        been degraded and oppressed by our nation, and we have for years denounced
                        the institution that bound them to the earth. We therefore owe them more
                        than common benevolence to amend for the injury we have done them. If we
                        therefore at once fit them for the position of freemen; if they are made
                        intelligent, virtuous, industrious, they will prove a great blessing to
                        themselves and the nation, but if they are left in ignorance, the victims of
                        loose and vile men, they will prove a curse to themselves and our country.</p>
                    <p>In many parts of the country societies are organized for the purpose of
                        raising funds to send teaches among them. This is a step in the right
                        direction. Let the right kind of teache[r]s among them. This is a step in
                        the right direction. Let the right kind of teache[r]s be sent, and plenty of
                        them, and it will not be long until a new era shall dawn upon our country,
                        and we can truthfully say, that our country is, "the land of the free" "and
                        the home of the brave." If history be true, our own race were as degraded
                        intellectually when the Romans invaded Britain, as ever the African race
                        was, yet by moral and intellectual training, it has surpassed all others,
                        and now stands the most powerful and enlightened race upon the face of the
                        earth.</p>
                    <p>What may be done with the African race in the future we cannot tell. We know
                        they have capacity, and this being the land of their birth, our duty is with
                        the present. That they have giants among them even in their degraded
                        condition does not admit of a doubt. In this broad land of ours, under the
                        blessing of our Government, they can be made useful to themselves, the
                        country and posterity. Let it the effort be fairly made.</p>

                    our civilization."</excerpt>
                <transcript>
                    <p>Never in the history of the world has a civil war been conducted in which
                        either of the belligerents has manifested as little rancor and bitterness as
                        the North has exhibited in the present struggle. To maintain its existence
                        the Government has given over to death thousands of its noblest sons, and
                        burdened itself with an oppressive debt, yet the heart of the people has not
                        been embittered, has no revengeful feelings to gratify, but still beats
                        kindly towards those who, in their madness and folly, have caused the
                        fearful sacrifice of blood and treasure. Although in attempting to subvert
                        the Government, the people of the insurgent states have been guilty of the
                        greatest offence known to the law, the punishment of which, the world over,
                        is forfeiture of life and property, and although in their desperate struggle
                        to effect their wicked purposes they have brought bereavement and affliction
                        to almost every household in the land, yet the Nation to-day stands ready to
                        welcome them back and to restore to them the forfeited rights of life and
                        citizenship. Our people entered into this struggle with no feelings of
                        personal or individual hostility, and are as free from them to day as when
                        the war began. While we were yet rejoicing over the triumph of our arms;
                        vessels ladened with the bounty of the North were entering the port of
                        Savannah to relieve its famished inhabitants. This noble charity to the
                        starving of that city, was the fruit of the same spirit that impelled the
                        people of the North, in the days of peace and Union, to stand between death
                        and the people of Norfolk. The absence of all vindictive feeling on our part
                        is a peculiarity of this struggle, which in history will be accepted as
                        proof of the noble character of our civilization, and which now gives the
                        assurance that when active hostilities cease, we will not have a Union of
                        discordant elements, but a Union existing in the amity and good will of the
                        people.</p>
