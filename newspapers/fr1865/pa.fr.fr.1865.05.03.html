                    <p>The citizens of Mercersburg and vicinity had appropriate ceremonies on the
                        19th ult., the day of the funeral of President Lincoln, and the following
                        eloquent and touching address was delivered on the occasion by Rev. Dr. H.
                        Harbaugh, Professor of Theology in Mercersburg:</p>
                    <p>It is most difficult, on this solemn occasion, for one to speak for another,
                        in the way of leading or interpreting his thoughts for him. This is one of
                        those overwhelming events which make one's thoughts stand still; and when we
                        feel the truth of the sacred declaration, that the heart knoweth its own
                        bitterness, and a stranger doth not intermeddle with it. For days past,
                        throughout the land, friend has met friend with the feeling that, in the
                        presence of so great a sorrow, silence is the most eloquent word. Even when
                        one ventured a word of remark or inquiry, it was with the vain hope that the
                        one addressed might be able to express and interpret for him his own deep
                        feeling.</p>
                    <p>When the telegraph first dropped this fearful news into the thousand cities,
                        towns and villages all over the land, men were stunned and paralyzed with
                        amazement. His implements dropped from the hands of the laborer; the student
                        cast away his pen and books; the merchant closed his store; the buzzing of
                        factories ceased; busy streets were changed into scenes of Sabbatic quiet,
                        and over all this expressive silence rolled the solemn sound of tolling
                        bells. The land mourned its fallen chief, as it had not mourned from the
                        first hour of the Republic till now.</p>
                    <p>We have sometimes heard of the coming together of a marriage and a
                        burial--where sorrow tread so closely on the heel of joy that the joyful
                        bride, on the very day of her happy marriage, was laid out as a corpse in
                        her wedding robes! In like manner has, during these last few days, the
                        nation's joy been suddenly changed into mourning. Scarcely had the bells
                        ceased tolling out their jubilations in honor of victory, and the prospect
                        of speedy peace, with the restoration of the supremacy of law and order
                        throughout the land, when they began to toll in sad harmony with a nation's
                        sorrow. And though days have passed since this fearful tragedy was enacted,
                        the national mind still labors under the subduing burden of its momentous
                        grief--still stunned and silent!</p>
                    <p>What is this all-pervading and steadily continued feeling, but the mute
                        utterance of the people's sense of the awfulness of the crime which has been
                        committed. The mind cannot fathom the turpitude of this crime of regicide, or the killing of the ruler of the land.
                        But the existing unutterable feeling furnishes proof that God, by the very
                        constitution of our being, has underlaid our deepest life with a sense of
                        its enormity; our nature thus spontaneously bearing witness to what has been
                        the sense of all civilized--yea, even barbarian and semi-barbarian--as well
                        as Christian ages and nations, that the highest possible crime is regicide.</p>
                    <p>This crime is not mere murder. We need only grade the higher crimes to enable
                        us to see where this emormity stands on the scale of criminal depravity. The
                        first and lowest grade is common murder or homicide, as when one man kills
                        another. Next above this we may place suicide, wherein man assumes the
                        disposal of his own life. Then fratricide, wherein man destroys the life of
                        his own brother or sister, and thus in a sense becomes the murderer of his
                        own flesh and blood. Then infanticide, where the helplessness of infancy
                        augments the crime. Then patricide, wherein man takes the life of the father
                        that begat him, the earthly source of his own life. Because the mother bears
                        that "softer and tenderer name," and her life belongs to the inner circle of
                        consecrated love, we would place next in the dreadful scale the crime of
                        matricide. After this only do we reach that fearful apex of crime--regicide!
                        So much as the State is above the family, so high above the murder of father
                        and mother is the murder of the Ruler of the land--the head of the
                        nation--the father, for the time being, of the national family. This is the
                        dreadful crime which has startled and stunned the nation, and caused the
                        bells throughout the land this day to dole out to responsive [illeg] muffled
                        tones of sorrow.</p>
                    <p>To [illeg] this crime of regicide, we must [illeg] was not merely the man Abraham Lincoln, whose life the assassin has
                        taken away [illeg] the life of the President of this Republic which he
                        destroyed. As a man he was only as one of us, but as God's ordained organ
                        for the administration of the government he was vastly more: He was "the
                            Minister of God," (Rom. XIII)--the organ of
                        "the powers that be which are ordained of God." These powers are "higher
                        powers"--that is, they are powers that come from above, not from men. Even
                        though, as in our own land, the Ruler, as organ of these powers, may be
                            designated by men, his investiture is from God alone. In his office the ruling Head of
                        the nation is God's minister. He places him there even though it be through
                        the will and vote of the people, to be for the nation His own organ and
                        administration of the higher powers. When the assassin assailed this Head of
                        the nation, and this right hand of God's rule on the earth, he was making
                        direct assault upon God's own authority in the high place of His power! On
                        this throne of earthly power he struck down whom God had set up. He feared
                        not the attempt, thus to wrest the government of a nation from the divine
                        hand itself, and by his own daring act first to arrest, then annul, and
                        finally to change the ruling Head of the nation in the face of God's
                        investiture, and the will of millions of men!</p>
                    <p>Moreover the act of the regicide is, as far as it goes, a stroke for anarchy.
                        A deadly thrust at the head paralyzes for the time the whole body of the
                        nation, and abrogates government, so that if the whole nation were in a
                        state adapted for the result, universal anarchy would ensue. It is only the
                        virtue and loyalty of the nation that prevents the legitimate effects of the
                        assassin's will and intention. Thanks to God for that true, vigorous,
                        adjusting virtue of the nation which enables it to rise from so fearful a
                        shock, and to move with such prompt firmness, harmony and power in the path
                        of its great and solemn mission! But this does not abate the turpitude of
                        the awful crime; on the other hand it sets its enormity only into stronger
                        relief, as showing the high character of the government he sought to annul,
                        and the generous loyalty of the millions against whose vigorous patriotism
                        the crime has been perpetrated.</p>
                    <p>Such being the character of the crime which has caused our present grief, and
                        such the horror with which this crime of regicide shows itself to be
                        regarded by the whole nation, in harmony with the deepest sense of all
                        civilized, and especially christianized, nations and ages, the sorrowing
                        millions may well this day lift their hands to heaven, and ask, How is such
                        an awful crime possible? Where is an adequate begetting and sustaining
                        element and basis for such a crime to be found? Certainly it has been in no
                        other way possible for it to appear except as the nursling and legitimate
                        ripe fruit of that spirit of enormous treason which has, during the last
                        four dreadful and bloody years, labored to consummate substantially the same
                        crime by aiming its deadly dagger at the very heart of the Republic itself.
                        Whether formally, and by organized conspiracy or not, still essentially and
                        really treason and rebellion is the legitimate mother of regicide. The
                        assassin of the President and head of the nation, whether thereunto
                        appointed or not, is the organ of that treason which has its embodiment in
                        the great Rebellion. It was the concentrated life of that great treason
                        which nerved his arm and guided the fearful weapon of death. The truth of
                        this fact beats to-day with powerful, harmonious, self-attesting assurance
                        in the patriotic and loyal instincts of millions of sad and sorrowing
                        hearts.</p>
                    <p>How better can we improve this sad occasion than to possess our souls more
                        fully with a deeper sense of the enormous crime of treason; a crime when,
                        according to the wisdom of all christian nations, can only be adequately
                        atoned for by the penalty of death. We speak our own deep convictions, and
                        we hope the convictions of all present, when we say that no sign of the
                        times portends greater danger to the nation at present than that morbid and
                        unchristian spirit which is in some quarters beginning its endeavors to
                        avert the penalty due to treason. We dread this spirit more than all else
                        that is before us as a nation. Such men as Beecher and Greeley, who are
                        endeavoring to lead off in this miserable effort to degrade and ignore the
                        internal sanctions of divine and human law, and to convert honest but
                        unreflecting people to their crusade against the true idea and end of law
                        and justice, are now emphatically the enemies of
                        the Republic. This mawkish sentimentality is called "magnanimity." What a
                        misnomer! Its true name is infidelity to the majesty of law. It offers a
                        premium for treason; and, if successful, will be the greatest unfaithfulness
                        and cruelty to posterity of which the rulers of our eventful age can be
                        guilty. It will be in truth the laying up of wrath, anarchy and rebellion
                        for our children. It will be a comforting precedent for treason in all
                        coming ages of the Republic. It will show that treason and rebellion deserve
                        and shall receive nothing but magnanimity, in a degraded sense of that word.
                        It will ever show that treason, so enormous in its sweep as to people a
                        hundred battle-field grave-yards with the bodies of brave and loyal men, has
                        earned for itself only the right of what is falsely called magnanimous
                        treatment. In pestiferous sentiments like these, be assured, lies deadly
                        poison, which if allowed to work its way into the heart of our rulers and
                        our people, will sooner or later take the nation's life as effectually as
                        the Rebellion itself, had it succeeded, would have done, and as it has
                        actually intended to do by bayonets, cannon, and starvation of thousands of
                        loyal and brave men, and which it has now again attempted to do as by
                        desperation, in the person of the assassin of the President.</p>
                    <p>Such sentiments were never come from earnest christian scholars or statesmen;
                        they are born in the hot-bed of socialism, naturalism and humanism. They are
                        not deep convictions, but merely shallow, irresponsible sensation
                        utterances. They are founded on no venerable wisdom; they rest in no true
                        christian principles--they are underlaid by no correct sense of the nature
                        and necessary force and majesty of law. Men who utter them may be able
                        effectually to harangue an unreflecting crowd, but when they attempt to lay
                        experimental hands to the guidance of the high and solemn interests of
                        States, every earnest and thinking man will exclaim: Procul, O! procul este profani!--hence, far hence ye profane.</p>
                    <p>To ask that the majesty of law be allowed to have its free course against
                        crime is no spirit of revenge, is no want of magnanimity--betrays no absence
                        of mercy and charity. If so God himself would fall under blame! Justice and
                        judgment are the habitation of His throne. Human governments are a parable
                        and reflection of His own. Human law is a reflection of His will. Human
                        justice is after the pattern of His justice. To abrogate the sanctions and
                        penalties of His law, is to annul one of His own attributes. In the
                        suffering of the penalty of human guilt in the person of His own Son, he has
                        demonstrated to the world that His mercy does not abrogate His justice. Vain
                        is the attempt of man to propose a sickly sentimentalism as a substitute
                        that shall outdo and set aside God's immutable law against crime. Men may be
                        tender, but law and justice are inflexible. We have heard of judges who
                        pronounced the sentence of death on murderers with
                        tears--but pronounced it in firm faithfulness nevertheless. The judge
                        who thus discharges his solemn duty to the law and society is twice great in
                        the act; great because he shows that he has all the feelings of the man, and
                        great again because he has all the firmness of the judge. Above all his
                        merely humane feelings rises the solemn conviction that the execution of the
                        law is absolutely necessary for the safety of society. He feels for the
                        criminal, but he does not suffer his feelings to carry him into a current of
                        washy sentimentalism. He pities the criminal, but he pities society more. It
                        is said that Washington signed the death-warrant of Andre, the spy, with
                        tears! This is proof that he would have spared even him had not a higher
                        obligation to honor the law rested on him. Let our rulers study this
                        example, that the majesty of law be not changed into a mere mawkish feeling.</p>
                    <p>May not, in this view, this sad calamity be overruled in mercy by an all-wise
                        though mysterious Providence, for the future health and safety of the
                        Republic? Whilst we hope that all manifestations of revenge may be checked,
                        we hope at the same time that the minds of our people and rulers may be more
                        deeply awakened to a sense of absolute necessity of vindicating the law
                        against treason. Vain is that policy which seeks to be wiser than God and
                        more humane than He! Should it appear that "the minister of God," does "bear the Sword in vain," we tremble for the
                        future of the nation. All the moral effect of all the sacrifices of the war
                        will in that case be virtually lost. Was this dreadful tragedy--well may we
                        ask--this sacrifice of the nation's beloved Chief and Head yet necessary to
                        counteract this vain and sickly sentimentality? Should it serve to effect
                        this high and solemn end, the sacrifice, dreadful as it is, will not have
                        been in vain.</p>
                    <p>May God, in His infinite mercy, preserve in the heart of the nation a proper
                        sense of the majesty of law, awaken among us right views of the awful crime
                        of treason--which is the cause and essence of regicide--and deliver us from
                        morbid sympathy for that crime which strikes at the root of all divine and
                        human government, and which the solemn sanctions of God, and the ripest
                        wisdom of all the past, have adjudged to be worthy of death.</p>
                    <p>I attempt no eulogy of our departed President. His earnestness, moderation,
                        kind-heartedness, proverbial honesty and unswerving loyalty and patriotism
                        are well known. Only when generations shall have passed away, and all the
                        seeds of the mighty present of the nation shall come to their full fruits in
                        the future, will his name and fame stand out in full relief on the historic
                        page. What if it should appear, to those who shall study the events of his
                        administration in the light of the future, that he was the leader of a high
                        and holy patriotic purpose, which has delivered the Republic from a bondage
                        as heavy and galling as that from which we were delivered by Washington at
                        the first? What if our children should experience the fact that the names of
                        George Washington and Abraham Lincoln may be sounded together with perfect
                        accord?</p>

                        Delivered in the House of Representatives on Thursday
                            evening, March 16, 1865, on the bill Providing for the Adjudication of
                            Border Military Claims.
                    </p>
                    <p>MR. SPEAKER:--The evening is far spent, and the House must be more than weary
                        of this debate. I am most anxious that a vote shall be reached to-night, and
                        for that reason until now refrained from participation in the discussion.
                        The measure has now been very fully considered. More than four hours of
                        debate, mainly from the foes of the bill, has presented every possible
                        objection that ambition, timidity and personal disappointment could hurl
                        against it; and I rise briefly to answer the main objections urged, in
                        justice to the people I have the honor to represent.</p>
                    <p>It has been a favorite argument, or rather pretext for opposition, with those
                        who desire the defeat of the pending bill, to characterize it as a swindle;
                        as a deliberate attempt to deceive, defraud, and mislead the members of this
                        House; and it has been boldly urged that it was a systematic attempt to ruin
                        the credit of the Commonwealth. It has been assaulted by every avenue that
                        mingled ingenuity and malice could invent. In answer to all this, sir, I
                        appeal to the bill itself. Here it is, head it; scan every section, every
                        line. Its language is plain; its sentences free from all ambiguity. It means
                        precisely what it says--that the despoiled people of the border shall have
                        some tangible evidence preserved of the losses they have sustained by the
                        tread of armies in this war, so that the government may, in the fullness of
                        time, requite them for their sacrifices. We have not sought to mislead any
                        one. We have not asked that these claims be adjudicated merely as a garland
                        to weave in the chaplet of our National sacrifices. It would be well, I
                        confess, to do it for that reason alone if there were no better arguments in
                        favor of it; but we ask adjudication so that there may be ultimate
                        resolution without wrong to either government or citizen.</p>
                    <p>Let me not be misunderstood. I stated in a former speech on this question,
                        and I repeat it now, that restitution to these sufferers is a duty the
                        government cannot, dare not disregard. Every reason urged against it
                        to-night is but an argument for it. If the claims are so large that they
                        would oppress the people of the State to pay them, it proves that the losses
                        of the few on the border are so crushing that every dictate of justice
                        demands relief. If too much for the State, with over three millions of
                        people, and untold millions of wealth, how must it fall upon a few thousand,
                        who are your brethren, the brethren of your constituents, and have joined
                        with you and yours to sustain our boasted Commonwealth for mutual protection
                        to person, to faith, to property! If the many cannot share this burden, how
                        are the few to bear it?</p>
                    <p>The gentleman from Philadelphia, (Mr. Ruddiman) who has just closed,
                        cautioned his fellow members that the passage of this bill would lead to
                        convulsions throughout the State; that it would lead to disasters which even
                        he seemed unequal to the painful task of depicting; that men must pause upon
                        the threshold of its passage, and learn from him the direful consequences
                        which must follow. I beg my ardent friend from Philadelphia to quiet his sad
                        apprehensions. Let him not commit the too common error of supposing that
                        because he has poured out the touching strains of the Sophomore and
                        convulsed himself with his own eloquence, the great Commonwealth will be
                        rocked in painful, agonizing fears for her fame and credit. His chaste and
                        exquisite rhetoric and impassioned, poetical sentences, do credit to his
                        head; but because one heart has been moved thereby to inconsolable grief at
                        the possibility of the success of the bill, he must not assume that the
                        State will tremble from centre to circumference. This same bill has passed
                        two legislatures of this State; has twice been approved by the Executive;
                        has been carried into practical operation for two years,--all before the
                        gentleman from Philadelphia was part of the law-making power of the State.
                        There was scarcely a division of sentiment on the subject in either branch.
                        It met the approbation of all, and there was no constituency that censured
                        its representatives therefor. There was no convulsion of the Commonwealth.
                        The sun still rose and shone with its accustomed splendor, and gilded the
                        western skies as it faded into night. The stars still twinkled merrily and
                        pierced the curtains of darkness. The birds sang just as sweetly; the
                        flowers bloomed as beautifully and spread broadcast their rich fragrance as
                        before. The seasons went and came; green spring-time, requiting harvest,
                        golden autumn and bleak winter, all brought their blessings and their
                        sorrows as in other days. The spheres stood firmly in their appointed work,
                        unconscious that the time for convulsion was at hand. The body politic moved
                        on in fulfillment of its beneficent mission to a free people, and is as yet
                        a stranger to the grief the burning words of the gentleman have portrayed
                        for its portion. There was no convulsion in nature or in government. Even
                        the gentleman himself forgot to become convulsed; or if he did, history has
                        not recorded it. His play, therefore, comes when its plot has already
                        miscarried. It is Hamlet with Hamlet omitted. It is a palpable abortion as
                        tragedy, and too stupidly grave for farce. It is simply a painful lesson
                        that others have lived and legislated before the gentleman from
                        Philadelphia, and he has forgotten it.</p>
                    <p>Previous legislatures not only cordially and with remarkable unanimity
                        sanctioned this measure; but the legislature of this State has, almost
                        without division of opinion, declared that these claims should be paid. In
                        1862, both branches passed a bill not only providing for adjudicating these
                        claims, but also providing for their payment out of the treasury of the
                        Commonwealth. Upon inquiry however it was found that the ordinary resources
                        of the treasury would not meet these demands, and the bill made no provision
                        for raising additional revenue. It was therefore re-called. At that time the
                        credit of the State was in peril. We had just accepted war as an inexorable
                        necessity. We were strangers to its arts and sacrifices, and were appalled
                        at the fraternal struggle with which we were overwhelmed by causeless, cruel
                        treason. Three millions of a loan had been put on the market and I know how
                        the authorities vibrated between hope and fear, and by common consent these
                        claims were postponed--not rejected--until a better day should dawn. All
                        admitted that our means were first due to the common cause of our threatened
                        Nationality, and the bill was modified to provide for adjudication, just as
                        the bill before the House now, and it passed without objection. There was
                        then no prophetic voice to tell of terrible convulsions as the legitimate
                        fruits of such legislation, and what may seem stranger still to the
                        gentleman from Philadelphia, there was no section or party that permitted
                        itself to be convulsed thereby.</p>
                    <p>The faith of this Commonwealth was pledged to every citizen that its honor,
                        its dignity and its protecting power should be faithfully maintained, and
                        all sections of the State confessed its justice and shared in its
                        vindication. At the time the measure was not mainly for those whom I now in
                        part represent. The invader had not then polluted our soil. It was for the
                        benefit of Philadelphia, of Chester, of Dauphin, of Allegheny, and of Erie,
                        that the first bill was passed; and had no foe reached our border to spread
                        desolation in a few counties, the counties I have named would have ardent
                        advocates of the principle of this bill in their representatives now on the
                        floor. Had any member then rose and advanced the arguments in opposition to
                        the bill which have been given to-night, they would not have been listened
                        to with common respect. But men have since learned to counsel with their
                        fears. The corrupt have marked this measure as their prey. They have
                        grappled with it relentlessly because it gives no promise of plunder, and
                        the petty waves of ambition have dashed against it with ceaseless fury. The
                        great vital principle on which it rests seems to have been forgotten or
                        rejected.</p>
                    <p>Why, sir, are we at war to-day with the common enemy of this government? Is
                        it simply because the North and the South differ in some abstractions? Have
                        we slain thousands of those who were once our brethren and dotted our fair
                        fields with untimely graves, for such a cause? By no means. We are at war
                        for a higher and holier purpose. We have given of our blood and treasure
                        unsparingly to preserve our government. Its blessings we regard as
                        priceless. Not merely its glory and its honor; but its protecting power,
                        endear it to all. It must be maintained in all its integral parts, or it is
                        worthless. It must exercise all its prerogatives--must vindicate its might
                        and supremacy, and give its just compensation for the tribute and fealty it
                        exacts. It cannot demand remorselessly and withhold its protecting arm. It
                        must have the power to shield the will to be just, and treat a wrong to its
                        humblest supporter as a wrong to the State. This is the rule of justice, and
                        it would be a blistering stain upon the now unblotted escutcheon of our
                        Commonwealth, did it turn a deaf ear to those upon whom the devastation of
                        war has fallen for the protection of all.</p>
                    <p>The gentleman from Philadelphia is quite too sweeping in his denunciation of
                        the principle of this bill. He denounces it as "a shame," as "monstrous,"
                        and yet if he were to turn from the legislature of the State and announce to
                        the people of his district that the duty of protection and retaliation do
                        not form the basis of our system of government, his constituents would bid
                        him learn his own laws and learn to respect and obey them. If in his own
                        city his home should be destroyed by a revolt, he would be prompt to demand
                        restitution to the uttermost farthing, and it would be promptly given. It is
                        the accepted law, not only of Philadelphia, but of every municipality of the
                        Commonwealth. At his home he rests in peace and safety. He yields tribute as
                        his government demands for the common good, and receives in return the
                        guarantee of protection or compensation in case of failure to protect. New
                        York city is now paying two millions of dollars to those her government
                        failed to protect from the rioters of 1863. She failed in her compact with
                        her people, and the duty of restitution is confessed by all. She is paying
                        more than one-half of all the losses of the border in obedience to the
                        settled law, based on eternal justice, that protection is one of the first
                        duties of government. Let the gentleman from Philadelphia return to his own
                        city and tell his people that they have erred until now--that government,
                        municipal, State and general, should merely exact and not remunerate when
                        remiss in protection, and there are few who would accept his new teachings
                        and applaud his wisdom. Let him stand on the hustings and proclaim there the
                        same doctrine he proclaims here, and his people will look for truer and
                        juster if not wiser men to enact their laws.</p>
                    <p>Such is the settled law of every city and town in the land, and wherein does
                        the municipal government of the State differ? We have already authorized six
                        millions of dollars to be expended to defend Pennsylvania. Not a voice was
                        raised against it in these halls. Not a murmur comes up from the people in
                        any part of the State. The duty to defend is confessed--it has not been
                        questioned, and will not be until some new Daniel shall come to judgement on
                        the issue like the gentleman from Philadelphia. Our common treasure is given
                        with a lavish hand to defend the homes and property of the border; but
                        defence ever came when danger was not at hand. Confessing the duty to
                        defend, and failing therein, what must follow by every rule of logic and
                        principle of justice? Restitution is inevitable. The only question should be
                        as to the ability of the government. If it is able to redeem its faith, it
                        can have no alternative without positive dishonor and perfidy to its people.</p>
                    <p>The gentleman from Philadelphia tells us of his valor in rushing to the
                        defence of the border to protect us. He tells us he was there in person;
                        shared the perils of the camp and enjoyed the fruits of the field. I
                        remember well, sir, when he was there. The militia came in 1862 and their
                        bloodless track remains. We have it in the mournful trace of desolation. We
                        have monuments of their presence but not of their dead. But silent as
                        history may be as to their sanguinary fields, the records of this war will
                        preserve to posterity the evidence of their organization and service. Their
                        pay rolls will perpetuate their achievements. (Laughter). They were not
                        unmindful that the State should exact no unjust sacrifice from any portion
                        of her people. With one accord they demanded their pay. If the gentleman
                        from Philadelphia was enrolled, he too doubtless was mindful that "the
                        laborer is worthy of his hire."</p>
                    <p>MR. RUDDIMAN--I gave no such intimation. I was not there in a military
                        capacity. I was there in offices of kindness and humanity. I deny both the
                        remark and the implication of the gentleman from Franklin.</p>
                    <p>MR. M'CLURE--Will the gentleman from Philadelphia inform me what offices of
                        humanity were to perform there?--whence came the wounded and suffering of
                        that army? What fields were crimsoned with its blood?</p>
                    <p>MR. RUDDIMAN--In the hasty call to the defence of the gentleman's homestead,
                        numbers rushed from my own city to take up arms, and to be the guardians of
                        the homes which the citizens were neither sufficient nor willing to be the
                        protectors. Among them were friends of my own who left behind
                        everything--their business interests and all that belonged to them. These
                        men who went away thus unprovided for were subjects of solicitude to others
                        and to myself. To attend upon them--to supply their wants--to give them what
                        they had gone without the furnishment of--I left my home and my business in
                        order that they might not suffer while they were doing good service for the
                        gentleman from Franklin and his constituents.</p>
                    <p>MR. M'CLURE--I remember the occasion well, and I would not detract from the
                        mission of humanity the gentleman was there to perform. He was not alone in
                        his enterprise. Few of his constituents in the ranks were without their like
                        ministers. They had more need for the gentleman from Philadelphia as Poet
                        Laureate than as surgeon or nurse. In common with others I welcomed them as
                        a necessity--all that I had was at their disposal to add to their comfort.
                        They were, as a rule, of the best men of the State, but they had no thought
                        of striking the foe. They were wanting in organization, in officers, in
                        equipments, in their commissary and quartermaster's departments, and studied
                        geography about the State line with more earnestness than the evolutions of
                        battalions. They were unprepared for war--could be nothing else because of
                        the haste with which they were thrown together. They had sense enough to
                        know it and they determined to avoid it. Imperfectly provided for, they
                        subsisted largely upon the inhabitants. They claimed freely and as a rule
                        received generously. Undisciplined, and commanded mainly by politicians and
                        political candidates, they would have been powerless before a disciplined
                        foe. They therefore came and went, subsisted and foraged, and the last
                        condition of our people was worse than the first. (Laughter). I state a fact
                        known to all who were charged with any responsibility in that memorable
                        campaign, that whatever may have been the feelings of pride and relief at
                        their march to the border, they were vastly enhanced when the militia were
                        got safely from the border to their homes again.</p>
                    <p>But while some marched and others refused to march when ordered to approach
                        the enemy, there was unanimity upon one point throughout that vast army. All
                        agreed that they must be paid. Then was the State convulsed from end to end.
                        The militia had earned thirteen dollars per man; an election was at hand,
                        and the State and National Government were required to observe a faith with
                        the militia even if there should be a pause in the war for the preservation
                        of the government. I was then in an official position connected with the
                        military department of this State; and politicians crowded the department
                        and demanded that all things should be set aside to pay the troops who had
                        marched to the border. And it was done. Delegation after delegation was
                        despatched to Washington, and there was no rest day or night until the men
                        to whom the gentleman from Philadelphia ministered humanity were paid their
                        wages. True the border people had lost more time; had, as a rule, given more
                        service, and lost by the total suspension of business and the ravages of ten
                        thousand raw and unprovided troops; but they were unthought of then, as they
                        seem to be forgotten now. The constituents of the gentleman from
                        Philadelphia were called to the border, at the expense of the government, to
                        share our dangers for but a fortnight. They did all that could have been
                        expected of them, and were entitled to compensation, but I submit that it
                        becomes not men to boast of their own services, or the services of their
                        constituents, as an argument against restitution to the plundered people of
                        the border. We of the border, and not the enemy, were the sufferers--were
                        necessarily so. We helped to pay them, and complain not of it. It was due to
                        them. They were sent in obedience to the duty of the government to defend;
                        and their wages, their subsistence and their damages sustained and
                        inflicted, with equal justice should be paid. Again in 1863 the foe invaded
                        our State, and the militia were called out. They again visited the border,
                        and again made their chief record in their pay rolls. They were again with
                        us to share for a few weeks the common perils of the border. So much was due
                        to the brethren of a Commonwealth. In addition to the personal dangers
                        shared with us by the militia, we periled everything besides. Again the
                        question of remuneration absorbed the dignitaries and prominent men of the
                        State. Delay could not be tolerated, and the Executive had to pledge the
                        faith of the State without law to compensate them. I do not complain of it.
                        They had just claim against the State for it, but was their exposure or
                        sacrifice even a tithe of that sustained by the border people? If one was so
                        clearly just as to override the law, what is the measure of justice in the
                        claims of those who have been bankrupted and rendered homeless by the
                        ravages of friend and foe? I recognize in this Hall some of the heroes whose
                        offices of humanity made them ceaseless in their efforts to pay the militia,
                        law or no law, and I regret to say that some of them seem now to have no
                        higher ambition than to defame the patient, faithful, despoiled people I
                        have the honor in part to represent.</p>
                    <p>I do not wish to be misunderstood. I do not mean to assail the patriotism or
                        valor of our militia. Any other ten thousand men from this or any other
                        State would have done just as they did. Their history is but the history of
                        undisciplined troops everywhere, and their devastation, however causeless
                        and wide-spread, is the common penalty of such defenders. I have referred to
                        them in answer to the gentleman from Philadelphia to show that what he
                        boasts of as an evidence of the fraternal kindness of the people to the
                        border, was but the work of death to us. Two-thirds of the losses sustained
                        in Franklin county, excepting the burning of Chambersburg, were inflicted by
                        our own troops. The insurgents were in an enemy's country with veteran
                        troops when they were with us, and discipline and order were essential to
                        their safety, while our own men were among there friends. I would not defame
                        them; but I cannot be silent when their heroism is boastingly contrasted
                        with my constituents, and their brief and bloodless service made a pretext
                        for withholding justice from the people they despoiled.</p>
                    <p>The gentleman from Warren (Mr. Brown) and the gentleman from Philadelphia
                        (Mr. Ruddiman) join in demanding that if losses of property on the border
                        shall be compensated, those who have given their sons and husbands as
                        sacrifices to save our Nationality in other sections should be repaid as far
                        as it is in the power of government to make restitution. Sir, the people
                        whose cause I defend tonight have been second to none in their sad
                        sacrifices of sons, and husbands, and fathers to destroy the murderous power
                        of treason. There is not an untimely grave in the districts of the gentlemen
                        that has not its counterpart in the beautiful valley of the Cumberland. We
                        too have mothers stricken by the angel of death, whose sons have fallen as
                        martyrs for our liberties. We too have widows mourning with their fatherless
                        children the sad exactions that civil war has made. We have vacant chairs
                        and broken circles thick as the City of Brotherly Love or the sons of the
                        North. We have broken hearts to solace; the keenest sorrows to heal;
                        bereavement with its terrible pall shadowing almost every home. In this our
                        sacrifices are but the common sacrifices of loyal men in all sections, and
                        we complain not. For this there can be no restitution. It is not in the
                        power of mortals to restore the martyred dead; but hundreds of those who are
                        thus bereaved to-day turn from their blackened walls and withered waste to
                        the graves of their holy offerings for the life of the Republic. They are
                        homeless, made so by the barbarous foe whose brutal fury they braved for
                        your protection, but they still have sacred shrines around which their
                        shadowed affections gather. Without habitations among the living, they have
                        holy altars with the dead, and these alone remain to mingle the sad
                        consolation of patriotism and love with their consuming sorrow. We boast not
                        of these sacrifices--we complain not of them. We have given of all we
                        possessed with unsparing hands to our common cause--our goods; our golden
                        harvests; our substance; and our sons and fathers have not been withheld.</p>
                    <p>Sir, I am not insensible as to the probable fate of the bill in this House. I
                        cannot be mistaken in the manifestations of sentiment already made. It does
                        not meet with the favor of a majority of my associates, and the vote soon to
                        be taken will consign it to death. I am prepared for the foreshadowed
                        result. I have spared no efforts, have been instant in season and out of
                        season to dissipate the groundless prejudices and calm the strange fears
                        which have confronted it from the beginning. When the vote about to be taken
                        shall have been recorded, the subject will not again agitate this
                        House--will not again convulse the timid and arouse the malice of those who
                        seem to hate the people who have suffered all things to preserve our
                        government. I shall return to my disappointed constituents and present the
                        record that has been made by this House, and they will not question the
                        fidelity and earnestness with which their representatives have labored in
                        behalf of the right. How deeply they will feel humiliated by the defeat of
                        this bill, after every possible misinterpretation of their motives and
                        wanton defamation had been employed against them, I need not here attempt to
                        portray. I know how keenly it will strike those, already thrice smitten by
                        the foe. They cannot but believe that their State is unmindful of them; that
                        while it sends the tax-gatherer and demands its full measure of tribute, it
                        forgets its solemn obligations to them. They have been taught that their
                        flag is the symbol of power, or protection from lawlessness within and foes
                        without, and they will believe so still. They will not falter in their duty
                        because the popular branch of the legislative has been faithless to them and
                        to the fame of their Commonwealth. They will bow to the decree of this House
                        tonight, well assured that more liberal and more just men will yet control
                        its actions. They will not complain of their government, nor will they
                        despair of its fulfillment of its highest prerogatives. They will, as best
                        they can, rear their homes again, plant anew their trodden fields, and make
                        beautiful again their withered flowers. They can if need be, afford to be
                        forgotten, even to be spurned with wanton insult by this House. They can
                        survive it; but the Commonwealth cannot. Theirs would be but the history of
                        the wrongs of individuals; but the blot upon the escutcheon of the State
                        would be ineffaceable. It would impair its power; teach distrust to its
                        people, and spread dishonor over its name and fame. No State, with our
                        exhaustless wealth, our heroic people, our just pride and untarnished
                        justice, can thus afford to disregard its accepted duties to any class of
                        its citizens. He who can declare himself a citizen of Pennsylvania, should
                        feel undoubted confidence that his boast is not an empty fraud. Rome
                        struggled for more than a century as to whether patricians or plebeians
                        should rule; but it was the highest pride of each to declare himself a Roman
                        citizen. It was the signal for respect, for justice, for protection within
                        the boundaries of civilization. And so it should be; it must be here. It may
                        not be so now; but it will be the policy of Pennsylvania, and when it
                        becomes accepted and established the trembling apprehensions and petty
                        hatreds of to-night will be disowned by their authors.</p>
                    <p>Sir, I have been pained, deeply pained, at the recklessness with which
                        disloyalty has been charged upon my immediate constituents. There may be
                        among those I represent, some who hate their country and its cause, and it
                        is possible that a few may have done themselves the dishonor to exact
                        exorbitantly from those who came to defend the State. If there are such,
                        they dare not avow it. They could not live in my county and declare by word
                        or deed, their sympathy with the enemies of the Government. For three
                        consecutive years the enemy has invaded our territory, and the authorities
                        were untiring in their efforts to ascertain who, if any, gave aid and
                        counsel to our foes. To but one was this terrible crime traced--a citizen of
                        York, and he lives today by the clemency of the President, who took from his
                        head the decree of death. Earnestly as the people of Franklin have differed
                        in their political faith, and firmly as a portion of them dispute the policy
                        of the war, I affirm it with confidence that, as a people, all stood
                        shoulder to shoulder and man to man to bring discomfiture upon the enemy
                        when he polluted our soil. They have been faithful in the past, and they
                        will be faithful still. There is no duty an endangered government can impose
                        upon them that they will not perform--no sacrifice can be demanded that they
                        will not cheerfully yield. They know the value of government, and they will
                        preserve it. If new graves, new bereavements are necessary to our national
                        life, they will be given. They will give their remaining homes and green
                        fields to the destroyer if need be to preserve to you and to them and to
                        posterity the measureless blessings of free government. They will not
                        reproach you because they have to bear the surges of the ruthless vandal
                        while you can dwell in peace and plenty in your homes. They will not murmur
                        that their seed-time and harvest come and go with nought but desolation,
                        while yours [section missing]<br> wrought; and as the green moss lives in
                        perpetual freshness on the chilly marble that marks the resting places of
                        their martyred dead, so will they follow with unfaltering devotion to the
                        cause of the Republic of our fathers. No studied wrong here --no perfidy
                        elsewhere, can make them aught else than faithful, though the mournful track
                        of war should come to every hearth-stone. They will do so because it is
                        their duty, and they shrink not from it. However this House may manifest its
                        indifference to their sufferings and to the dignity and fame of the
                        Commonwealth, they will accept the wrongs inflicted upon them by war as
                        wrongs to the State, and so within due time, our legislation declare.</p>
                    <p>In sincerest sorrow I am compelled to advert to the singular position assumed
                        on this question by those who claim to be the peculiar supporters of
                        government and law--my own political associates. With few exceptions they
                        have resisted this bill with an earnestness and energy that illy becomes the
                        advocates of the supremacy of government in all its might and prerogatives.
                        I fear, sir, that they have done us wanton wrong--that they have doomed us
                        to cruel embarrassments or it may be hopeless discomfiture, where our
                        struggles have been fiercest for success. They should bear in mind that the
                        mutations of politics deny perpetual power to any organization. In two
                        consecutive years I served in this House in a minority of one-third and a
                        majority of two-thirds; and I fear that the action of this House to-night
                        will but hasten the day when the men who shall stand where I address you,
                        will speak for the minority.</p>
                    <p>MR. BROWN--I will ask the gentleman from Franklin if he means to say that he
                        will be on the Democratic side of the House?</p>
                    <p>MR. M'CLURE--Sir, the member from Franklin is one of those who has borne the
                        burden and heat of the day to give success to the Union party. He has been--</p>
                    <p>MR. BROWN--Will the gentleman answer my question, whether he will vote on the
                        other side of this House if this bill does not pass?</p>
                    <p>MR. M'CLURE--There must be few to whom any answer to the question is
                        necessary. I have been constant in season and out of season to defend the
                        doctrines and policy of the party with which the gentleman from Warren (Mr.
                        Brown) and myself act. Sir, I am incapable, as he must know, and as I have
                        ever shown on this floor, of being influenced in my political opinions or
                        actions by any decision this House may give on this or any other question. I
                        cannot be changed in my purposes, or efforts, no matter what may be the fate
                        of this bill. No man has shown on this floor a more earnest devotion to the
                        doctrines of the Union party and to the interests of the government, and the
                        humble member who now addresses you. I have spoken of that which I fear the
                        future must produce by the illiberal and unwise action of the House on this
                        question.</p>
                    <p>MR. BROWN--I will put the direct question--whether if this bill is not passed
                        he will go over to the Democratic party?</p>
                    <p>MR. M'CLURE--I can give the gentleman from Warren (Mr. Brown) facts, but
                        cannot give him comprehension. (Laughter.) I have answered distinctly that
                        no action of this legislature on this or any other question can make me
                        change my political associations or convictions in any degree.</p>
                    <p>MR. BROWN--That is all right.</p>
                    <p>MR. M'CLURE--No man knew better than the gentleman from Warren (Mr. Brown)
                        that it was all right before.</p>
                    <p>I would remind members of the House, as a fact with which we must deal, that
                        it has become the accepted policy of the minority of this House to maintain
                        the faith of the Commonwealth unsullied on this question. It matter not why,
                        or for what reason. Men may impugn their purposes and declare it but an
                        effort for power; but they have been consistent from the first, and their
                        record is unbroken in behalf of the honor of the State. They have shown it
                        on every test on this question. They have not counseled with their fears.
                        They voted for it last year, and they found no convulsion, no complaint at
                        home. I ask men who seek the supremacy of right in politics not to turn
                        blindly away from these facts. This question will be carried to every
                        household in the land. In spite of the selfishness that the mousing
                        politician would arouse, the people of Pennsylvania love justice. Their
                        appreciation of it is mightier than the sophistries that ingenuity or malice
                        can weave around the issue. And when the revulsion comes, can the rejected
                        and long-suffering greet the day with else than joy because justice and the
                        honor of the State have triumphed? Look well to the lease of political
                        power. It is at best but transitory. The wisest councils and most sagacious
                        leaders have even failed to make it perpetual, and let the Union party not
                        surrender its supremacy because it was forgetful of justice.</p>
                    <p>Sir, I must close. My earnestness in behalf of a people who, ever faithful in
                        evil and good report, have been taught that it is theirs to wait and suffer,
                        may excuse the length and ardor with which I have spoken. I have now in my
                        feeble way fulfilled my trust, and the issue is with you. If your record
                        shall not be in vindication of our common brotherhood as citizens of a great
                        Commonwealth, I shall wait hopefully, confidently for the better day when
                        the despoiled people of the border will learn that our boasted government
                        recognizes all its obligations, and reaches out its strong arm to prevent
                        unequal burdens from falling upon any portion of its citizens. They with me
                        will hope and wait, and the day will come when equal and exact justice to
                        all will be indelibly inscribed in our history by ample restitution to those
                        upon whom has fallen the brutal fury of the foe.</p>

                    has swept the insurgent States."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Rebellion is ended! The last army of crime at all formidable in numbers
                        and prowess has surrendered to Gen. Sherman. No organized force of the foe
                        now inhabits the States East of the Mississippi. Texas has still what is
                        called the Trans-Mississippi rebel army under Gen. Kirby Smith; but it must
                        rapidly waste away if it does not follow the example of the trained and
                        battle-scarred armies of Lee and Johnston, and yield obedience to the
                        government they sought to destroy.</p>
                    <p>Thus has Peace broken upon us through Victory. It was the only channel
                        through which tranquillity could come with honor and the promise of
                        endurance. The military power of treason has been utterly, hopelessly
                        broken, and rebellion lives only in history to teach mankind to curse its
                        authors. It has dotted our fair land with untimely graves. It has spread
                        desolation over every State that owned its dominion. It has bereaved the
                        whole Nation, and shadowed nearly every household circle with sadness. It
                        has entailed a staggering debt to fall now alike upon loyal and disloyal,
                        and it has doomed to a dishonor worse than death men who once filled the
                        high places of the Republic.</p>
                    <p>Such are fruits of treason. It has no compensation for its terrible
                        sacrifices. It is all exaction, desolation, despotism, death. It fades away
                        before the vindicated majesty of the government without one redeeming virtue
                        to plead in extenuation of its atrocity in history. Save that its warriors
                        were brave and its leaders skillful, it has nothing in its chequered and
                        blotted record worthy of imitation. No new Davis's and Lees will learn of
                        this cruel war, and pant for the fame rebellion has won for its authors. All
                        the world will shun and condemn those who so causelessly inaugurated it, and
                        their bloody failure and unmingled shame will make future generations true
                        to mankind, to order, and to law.</p>
                    <p>The power of Treason is conquered. Its mournful sacrifices are ended, but
                        government has now to be inaugurated over the chaos that has swept the
                        insurgent States. With this delicate and solemn duty the new administration
                        is charged, and it will demand all the wise foresight and generous
                        forbearance that our most enlightened statesmen can exercise. They are
                        charged with a Nationality just rescued from its deadly foes and redeemed
                        from the stain of bondage, and its perpetuity and power and prosperity are
                        in their hands. They have started well. A faithful people is rallying to
                        their support with an earnestness bounded by no party lines, and we look
                        upon the past with melancholy pride, we look upon the future hopeful, even
                        confident, that henceforth the aim of government and people will be--LIBERTY
                        AND UNION, NOW AND FOREVER, ONE AND INSEPARABLE."</p>
