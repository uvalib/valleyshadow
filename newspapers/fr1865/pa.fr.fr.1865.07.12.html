<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Friday last Mrs. Mary E. Surratt, Lewis P. Howell alias Lewis Payne, Geo. A. Atzeroth and David E. Harold suffered
                        the extreme penalty of the law by hanging, in accordance with the verdict of
                        the military court convicting them of participation in the assassination of
                        the President and the attempted murder of Secretary Seward, and Michael
                        O'Laughlin, Samuel Arnold, Dr. Samuel A. Mudd and Edward Spangler have been
                        consigned to hard labor in the Albany penitentiary--the three former for
                        life and the latter for the term of six years. Thus in less than ninety days
                        after the conspiracy culminated in the murder of our Chief Ruler, all who
                        actively participated in it have been brought to fearful justice, save John
                        H. Surratt who is still a fugitive; and he must soon learn that his fiendish
                        mother has atoned for her revolting crime on the gibbet. Carefully and
                        profoundly as the great conspiracy was conceived and planned in all its
                        details, the government was advised of the names, whereabouts and
                        participation of all the leading actors therein a very few days after the
                        Nation was appalled and shrouded in gloom by the untimely and violent death
                        of Mr. Lincoln; and but one has escaped the just penalty for the horrible
                        deed. The act for which they in their madness hoped to be blessed by
                        millions of people, made them shunned and abhorred of all mankind--of friend
                        and foe of the Republic, and they were wanderers until justice brought them
                        within its terrible grasp. Booth, the chief conspirator and murderer was
                        turned from almost every door without sympathy. Even in the land of treason
                        he had to disown his name and crime to procure shelter, and finally he died
                        unwept by any save the few who were dishonored by his name and blood, and
                        none but the chief of the secret police and one trusted assistant can mark
                        his grave. Now four others who shared his perfidy to their common country
                        and joined the crowning crime of the nineteenth century, have been hurried,
                        by the avenging arm of justice, to the bar of Him who shall judge all the
                        living, and their names will live henceforth in history only as typical of
                        the deepest infamy with which the annals of crime in the Western World are
                        blotted. We would that they had been tried by the civil authorities--not
                        because any injustice has been done, but because the impartial historian
                        must record the constitution of a military tribunal for such a trial when
                        the functions of the civil tribunals were fully and freely exercised, as a
                        grave error and a dangerous precedent; but the verdict and its fearless
                        execution will stand approved wherever justice is revered.</p>
                    <p>Thus swiftly and terribly has the strong arm of justice fallen upon those who
                        were the immediate conspirators to deprive the nation of its constitutional
                        and beloved ruler by violence; but we insist that the work of justice is yet
                        unfinished. These columns have never counseled or sanctioned vengeance on
                        the part of the government. In its great triumph over treason it will best
                        serve its great purpose and vindicate its invincible power and blameless
                        majesty by the magnanimity that ever characterizes the noble victor; but
                        treason has given birth to crimes hitherto unknown in the history of
                        civilized nations, and it would be neither just to the martyred dead nor
                        merciful to the living to demand no atonement therefor. Jefferson Davis was
                        the chief executive of the so-called confederacy. He it was who wielded
                        despotic power for four years in the revolted States. He dictated and
                        enforced the policy of the insurgents, and he it was who, as a part of his
                        system of warfare, deliberately and remorselessly doomed thousands upon
                        thousands of Union prisoners to the most horrible death by starvation and
                        wasting disease. This monstrous crime stands out as the colossal crime of
                        the war; the master-piece of treason's savagery. Around Andersonville alone
                        some seventeen thousand have welcomed the grave as a refuge from rebel
                        brutality and starvation, and other thousands still linger in hopeless
                        disease, waiting for the fullness of treason's work.This revolting chapter
                        was no accident, and was not dictated by necessity. It was deliberately
                        planned by the rebel authorities and enforced with relentless cruelty by
                        Jefferson Davis, now a prisoner in Fortress Monroe. Some of his officers
                        have protested, and his Congress was compelled to take formal cognizance of
                        the barbarities into which treason had dragged them; but Mr. Davis, who was
                        supreme in power and had but to command or suggest and the starvation of
                        prisoners would have ended, persisted in the diabolical murder until the
                        last shadow of his power had vanished.</p>
                    <p>If Mrs Surratt and Payne and their co-conspirators were justly executed, as
                        is confessed on every hand, what should be the
                        action of the government in disposing of its arch-criminal now in Fortress
                        Monroe? They murdered one man--though a chosen and revered ruler he had but
                        one life to give to the demons who destroyed him. Davis has filled thousands
                        of untimely graves with the victims of the most cruel murders in our
                        history. It was wanton, causeless and without the shadow of excuse or
                        palliation. He did it in insolent violation of the accepted rules of war. If
                        he had shot down a prisoner brought before him in Richmond, who could
                        gainsay the he should be tried by a military tribunal for violating the laws
                        of war and condemned to die?--and when he, by the mere exercise of despotic
                        power, deliberately dooms thousands of prisoners to the most shocking
                        cruelties and death, what should be the penalty? We insist that he should be
                        tried in conformity with the laws of war, by a commission composed of the
                        ablest officers of the army, and when shown to be guilty of the horrible
                        charge, he should die as did the murderers of less note and less guilt on
                        Friday last.</p>

<b>Micawber Democracy</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>An attack on Philip Johnson, M. C. from Easton, a "Micawber Democrat" who,
                    once elected to Congress, opposed the war at every step of the way and "voted
                    steadily against men and means to prosecute the war." Though Johnson may have
                    been under the false impression that the President was sympathetic to his way of
                    thinking, the executions of the four conspirators has quickly settled the issue.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Hon. Philip Johnson, M. C. from Easton has had the singular fortune to be
                        reared in the Tenth Legion where Democracy, draft riots, bounty jumpers, and
                        coppery serpents generally do most vegetate. Had he been a resident of a
                        more enlightened and patriotic section, with his moderate attainments and
                        immoderate semi-rebel proclivities, he would have been an outcast and a
                        reprobate: but with a people in harmony with his views he has managed to
                        worry his way into Congress, and has been thrice elected because his
                        constituents have never been able to decide which of the many better men
                        offering should be taken. Being in Congress, he well appreciates his own
                        importance, and is a fit leader for the Micawber branch of the late
                        Democracy. He is weary of standing out in the cold, hungry for the
                        flesh-pots, and like the sanguine Micawber himself, he considers the
                        eventful hour at hand when something is certain to turn up.</p>
                    <p>He tried to persuade the people of the Nation that the war was a
                        failure--voted steadily against men and means to prosecute the war,
                        denounced every act of the government for the suppression of the rebellion -
                        bad draft riots and the murder of government officials as common occurrences
                        in his district; but in spite of all these persistent efforts of his in
                        behalf of treason and slavery, both have collapsed, and with them the
                        prospects of the whole Micawber school. Something else must be
                        done--something must turn up; and in the fertility of his invention he
                        proposes to fling his slimy, treasonable arms around President Johnson and
                        compass his destruction by his proffered support. He says, in an
                        effervescing 4th of July letter, that President Johnson "has proven his
                        devotion to the South and the Union by holding onto both and making more and
                        greater sacrifices for both than any other man north or south. "Let him but be well advised!" proclaims this
                        sanguine political Micawber, and all will be well. Let him but throw himself
                        into the hands of the men who pursued him and his cause with tireless
                        antagonism - let him dispense to his own and his country's deadly foes the
                        honors and emoluments within his gift, and Micawber Johnson will hail
                        President Johnson as "the restorer of his country," and sound his praises
                        while his patronage lasts. But the negotiations seem to work badly. Since
                        the letter was written, President Johnson has so far forgotten himself as to
                        hang four of Micawber Johnson's friends in Washington, simply because they
                        were treasonable murderers, and probably the fulsome praises of Micawber
                        will cease. If President Johnson shall be so rude as to reject Micawber
                        Johnson's tender proposals, let Micawber turn to some more congenial and
                        appreciative friends. There is one Robert E. Lee in Virginia; one Davis at
                        Fortress Monroe; one Breckinridge any where outside the confines of the
                        United States, and various others of the same sort, all of whom are
                        eminently devoted to the Micawber theory, and will join hands to praise or
                        condemn the President as circumstances may warrant. We beg Micawber Johnson
                        to be patient, somebody will take him although President Johnson will not;
                        and if he can't get terms to suit himself and his seedy followers, he must
                        suit himself and his crew to such terms as he can get. Patience is a virtue
                        and we beg Micawber Johnson to study it. If he can't get President Johnson's
                        old clothes, he can denounce him and wait for the good time coming for
                        Micawbers. It may come in the next forty year, and if the old Micawbers can
                        wait for it, they can console themselves by assuring the little Micawbers
                        that the far future has something in store for them. However little or long
                        ahead, it will be something to break the cruel surges of despair. In the
                        meantime Micawber Johnson can go in freely--he can try all around. If the
                        front door won't open, let him try the back door, the window, the kitchen,
                        the cellar, or any other point with a savor of plunder about the White
                        House, and when he has exhausted all his efforts, and finds just nothing for
                        his labors and eulogies, he can return to the old camp of the Democracy no
                        worse than when he started, and keep waiting, ever waiting, for the luckless
                        day when something will "turn up" for the Micawber Democracy. </p>

                        To the Editors of the Franklin Repository
                    </p>
                    <p>I was gratified with your admirable article in a late number of your paper on
                        the above subject, and as you desired an expression of opinion on the part
                        of those who had cultivated the Tappahannock or (white smooth eared)
                        Boughton wheat, I take the liberty of contributing my observation and
                        experience in regard to its cultivation for three years past.</p>
                    <p>So far it has more than realized my expectations, although the severe winter
                        of 1863-4 damaged the crop in every instance in this vicinity, so far as I
                        know, except my lot of 21 acres, which was ripe for the cradle on the 25th
                        of June (1864), and yielded 66 bushels of as fine a specimen of plump, white
                        wheat as I ever saw. The flour from it was extra good. The reason why mine
                        was not frozen out is to be attributed, I suppose, to the fact that I top-dressed it in the fall. My red Mediterranean
                        wheat in an adjoining lot, sowed on the same day as the white (14th
                        September), was nearly damaged by the fly. It yielded only 16 bushels to the
                        acre.</p>
                    <p>This year I had but 21 acres of the Boughton wheat, and none of the red. It
                        was ready to be cut on the 23d of June, although the threatening aspect of
                        the weather prevented me from having it reapt until the 27th. Neither weevil
                        nor rust effected it--not at all. It stood up
                        well, although the growth was rank and unusually tall. Owing to this last, I
                        attribute the fact, that the grains are not quite as plump as they were last
                        year, although they are of fair size and I think will hold out in weight,
                        (last year the weight was 64 lbs per bushel). I gave a slight top-dressing
                        to a portion of it last fall also, and even the stubble now shows how
                        grateful the land is for a little extra favor bestowed in this way. I think
                        you are perfectly right when you say that the Boughton wheat should have a
                        little extra culture. Give it a good soil and it
                        will give a good yield.</p>
                    <p>I have 64 dozen of wheat from the above 21 acres. If it should yield only 50
                        bushels, it will be better than a great many of our best fields of red wheat
                        will yield this year. But I am inclined to think it will yield nearer 60
                        than 50 bushels.</p>
                    <p>Of one thing I am fully convinced--we must discard such wheats as are late in
                        ripening, at least until the weevil, fly and rust pass away. Whatever
                        preferences we may have in other respects, we should see to it that we
                        obtain wheat which ripens early, whatever kind of
                        wheat that may be. So far the Boughton wheat has answered my purpose well,
                        and hence I shall hold on to it. I may perhaps try the Amber wheat also, as
                        it is said to be an early kind. R. S. SCHNECK.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Press of Friday last has the following
                        sensible view of the Oil trade and Oil stocks:--The oil-stock business is
                        still in its transition state. The wonderful success that many of the
                        companies have attained in the past, the remarkable swiftness with which
                        fortunes were made, by the lucky, stimulated speculation to an extraordinary
                        extent. In the beginning everything was favorable, but too much speculation
                        has affected the whole oil-producing occupation, and at the present time the
                        petroleum interest is flattened out. Oil stocks are discouraged, and buyers
                        are cautious. Undoubtedly many of the moonshine corporations which have been
                        started will have to fail. They will exhaust the means and patience of their
                        stockholders. The latter will resolve to pay no more money, considering what
                        they have already contributed as inevitably lost. Either a few men will get
                        the management of them, or they will be sold out, and those who come in at
                        the death will bag the game. And yet, with all these disadvantages,
                        petroleum, per se, will not suffer. It has become
                        an object of worth to commerce, and the demand for it will be steady. If the
                        number of producers decrease, the value of productions increase. The
                        companies organized for the production of oil, which have avoided the arts
                        of the stock exchange, which have at all times paid attention to the
                        development of their lands, and which have been managed with patient
                        industry, will reap the benefit. Their course was clear from the first. It
                        was to attend to their own business, unmindful of the turmoil around them.
                        They are now approaching the time when it will be demonstrated that this
                        policy will pay. As the number of flimsy companies fade out--as the chaff is
                        riddled from the grain--the old-fashioned, honestly conducted companies will
                        rise in estimation. They will find their reward in good prices for their oil
                        and enhanced value for their stocks. Happy they who have interest in such
                        concerns, for they will undoubtedly receive the benefit of their patience
                        and perseverance.</p>
                    <p>The general depression in all branches of business has seriously effected the
                        stock market, and Oil stocks have been extremely dull for some weeks past.
                        Indeed there are very few sales of any stocks, and there will be but few
                        until the summer months are passed. But while stocks are dull in speculative
                        channels, there never was such earnest, gigantic and diversified development
                        in the oil region as this summer. Despite the severity of the winter, which
                        stopped all operations preparatory to boring, and the destructive March
                        flood, which carried off half the derricks on the oil streams, the work of
                        developing has been prosecuted with boundless energy, and must soon tell
                        sensibly on the value of all stocks which have any substance in them. All
                        the leading commercial journals predict a degree of activity in oil stocks
                        this fall surpassing anything we have yet witnessed. They will then be
                        better understood--the worthless and bogus companies will be exposed and
                        driven from the market, and the good companies will generally have tested
                        the quality of their lands. The sooner the bogus companies are exploded the
                        better, as the public will then be able to invest with much more safety and
                        the stock of reliable companies, which is now prostrated with the bogus
                        organizations because accurate discrimination is impossible, will advance in
                        value to a just standard. We are glad to see the officers of several
                        swindling concerns in the courts now in Philadelphia and New York, and the
                        more vigorously that work is pushed by defrauded stock holders, the sooner
                        will holders of good stocks realize a just value for them. All the
                        indications point to the production of vast quantities of oil this summer
                        and fall, and many stocks which now hang sluggishly on the hands of owners
                        will attain vast value.</p>
                    <p>There are over twenty wells in various stages on the Imperial property, and
                        four on the Sterling--all of which must be tested within sixty days, and
                        some of them sooner. An 800 barrel well was struck on the 15th-hole quite
                        near to the property of the Sheridan and Cherry Run property last week, and
                        that stock is consequently held at an advanced rate.</p>
                    <p>The National Bank of Chambersburg has declared its regular semi-annual
                        dividend of five percent and, as will be seen by the statement presents a
                        clever addition to its surplus profits. Its total circulation, new and old,
                        is $510,270; its deposits $268,323.48; and its surplus fund $39,833.41.
                        Considering that it made a twenty per cent gold dividend when the change was
                        made, it presents a flattering balance sheet.</p>
                    <p>The First National Bank of Greencastle presents its first quarterly statement
                        in our advertising columns to-day, and does credit to the direction of the
                        institution. Its loans and securities amount to over $30,000; its deposits
                        exceed $35,000 and its profits and earnings reach $3,628.58. It is greatly
                        abridged in its operations for want of its circulation, which it will have
                        in a very short time.</p>
