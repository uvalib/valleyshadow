<b>How They Look At It</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>According to the Mobile Tribune's correspondent, Southerners should not shy
					away from the political process if they hope to receive compensation for the

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>CITIZENS OF FRANKLIN COUNTY! Another and an important election is at hand;
						one which appeals to every voter for deliberate, intelligent, unprejudiced
						action. Indifference on the part of any citizen at such a time is criminal.
						The right of suffrage is an inestimable privilege, but it is a great error
						to suppose that it is a privilege that the good citizen can exercise or not,
						as he feels inclined. The duty to exercise it whenever occasion offers is an
						imperative one, and that man who fails to do so, through indifference or
						neglect, disregards an obligation he owes to his government.</p>
					<p>There has never been an election, under our present system of government, so
						unimportant as to release the citizen from his obligation. The interests of
						society or the State are always either to be promoted or prejudiced by the
						election or defeat of one or other of the contending parties. It is
						impossible in the nature of things to have such matters so evenly balanced
						that the citizen is left without a preference. If weighted in the balance
						one or other of the tickets will strike the beam. There is always sure to be
						some consideration that will incline the balance.</p>
					<p>Never were parties further from an equipoise than they are this Fall. The
						opposing candidates have not equal claims upon you, nor can the sentiments
						of both commend themselves to the honest judgement of the same mind. The
						issue is one made up of individual qualification and merit, vital principle
						and moral effect. You are familiar with the opposing parties and you know
						their respective candidates. You know that one is represented in this
						campaign by men who have been faithful to their country in her greatest
						trial, some of whom have deserved the gratitude of their countrymen by
						services in the field and others by faithful adherence to her cause at home;
						and you know that the other side asks preferment for men whose course during
						the time of national troubles indicated a sympathy with our enemies, and
						whose efforts were given more to retard, than to help on the work of
						conquering rebellion. Can you hesitate as to which of these you will give
						your support? Would it not be base ingratitude to open the doors of
						preferment to men who turned their backs upon the government when it was in
						danger, and to close it upon those who in that crisis rendered her what
						assistance they could? The ticket the Union party presents to you is
						unexceptionable. The State ticket bears the names of two of our most eminent
						soldiers, who have gathered their honors where the danger was greatest,
						while the District and County tickets are composed of the names of men all
						of whom have given evidence of their patriotism by services on the field or
						by faithful adherence to their country's cause at home, and who are well
						qualified to discharge the duties of the offices for which they are
						candidates.</p>
					<p>Then again, have you the honor and credit of your STATE and NATION at heart?
						If you have, will you aid that party that seeks to establish them both on an
						enduring basis of peace and prosperity, by reaping the rich fruits of the
						nation's triumph, that endeavors to maintain their honor and integrity by
						enabling them to redeem every pledge of citizens and soldiers, and that is
						pledged to advance the interests of labor everywhere; or will you support
						that party whose whole purpose is to give victory to the conquered, to
						destroy your national credit and bring you again under the power of the
						spirit of SLAVERY? You have to choose for yourselves.</p>
					<p>The Union party never made you a pledge that it has not faithfully redeemed.
						Your memories are treacherous indeed, if you have forgotten how often the
						Democratic party have broken the word of promise to your hope. The latter
						now seeks power through the aid of the very men who were most active in
						inaugurating rebellion, and promises to restore them to the supremacy that
						Democratic subserviency gave them before the war. Its sympathies are just as
						much with these men now as when your capital was besieged or your State
						invaded; and for a poor mess of official pottage it is willing to barter off
						the grand results of the war, which were purchased at such a fearful cost,
						and to surrender into the hands of the vanquished the trophies of the
						conqueror. Shall the power of this government pass into the hands of men who
						acknowledged allegiance to such a party? If you permit it, your troubles
						have only commenced. If you wish to secure peace and prosperity to the
						Republic you must commit its government into the hands of its friends, and
						exclude from place and power all who sympathize with its enemies.</p>
					<p>SOLDIERS! Our cause appeals to you for your active, undivided support.
						DEMOCRACY has no claims upon you. It has merited your stern rebuke. Remember
						how it attempted to disfranchise you when you were braving the dangers of
						the field, and how it used every means to weaken you and strengthen your
						enemies. It never rejoiced when you achieved a victory nor wept when
						disaster overtook you. It opposed every effort that was made to strengthen
						your ranks, and denounced you as hirelings and mercenaries.</p>
					<p>You triumphed over your enemies with field and earned a nation's thanks. The
						price of that victory was the lives of your noble comrades, the ghastly
						wounds of others and the heroic labor of all. Will you now permit that
						enemy, aided by the cupidity and subservience of the DEMOCRACY, to reap the
						fruits of the victory you gained? You saved the REPUBLIC by your bullets,
						assist it now with your ballots. You acted well your part as soldiers, let
						the same love of Country, and devotion to freedom characterize you as
						citizens. One and all, stand firm.</p>
					<p>UNION MEN OF FRANKLIN COUNTY! You made for yourselves a glorious record
						during the last four years of danger and trial to the Republic. You
						contributed both blood and treasure in patriotic abundance to the defence of
						your Government, and suffered uncomplainingly the fortunes of war, that the
						government might live. You performed your entire duty with a fidelity which
						will be remembered and extolled by those who come after you. Will you falter
						now when there are no hardships to be endured, no exactions to be demanded?
						Will you, by supineness and indifference, permit the old enemy you have so
						often vanquished to triumph in this contest? We trust not. Victory is within
						your grasp. Exert yourselves to the end that a full vote may be polled and
						all will be well. A large majority of the voters of our County are
						undeniably with us and nothing but disgraceful lethargy on you part can give
						success to your enemy.</p>
					<p>We entreat you to do your whole duty as citizens, and to exert yourselves as
						men having a due regard for the honor of your State and the general welfare
						of the people.</p>

						omit certain portions of it, but we have tried to preserve the line of the
						argument unbroken. It is just such a paper as we would expect from an able
						lawyer like Mr. Cessna, and as a fair examination and interpretation of a
						law that has too long been defied, it will commend itself to all impartial
						minds:</p>
					<p>"On the subject of elections, the Constitution of Pennsylvania provides:</p>
					<p>Article III<br> "Section I.--In elections, by the citizens every white freeman, of the
						age of twenty-one years, having resided in this State one year, and in the
						election district where he offers to vote ten days immediately preceding
						such election, and within two years paid a State or County tax, which shall
						have been assessed at least ten days before the election shall enjoy the
						rights of an elector; but a citizen of the United
						States who had previously been a qualified voter of this State, and
						removed therefrom, and return and shall have resided in the election
						district, and paid taxes as aforesaid, shall be entitled to vote after
						residing in the State six months; Provided, that white freemen, citizens of the United States, between the ages of
						twenty-one and twenty-two years, and having resided in the State one year,
						and in the election district ten days, as aforesaid, shall be entitled to
						vote, although they shall not have paid taxes."</p>
					<p>It is important here to observe that it is not all white
							men that are entitled to vote, but white
							freemen. Throughout the entire section the words "citizens of the
						United States" are used in the same connection, and it is apparent that the
						word "freemen" used in this section is equivalent to the word citizens.</p>
					<p>In the case of the State of Tennessee vs. Ambrose, 1 Meigs' R., 331, the
						Supreme Court of the United States held that the word "freemen" used in the
						Constitution of Tennessee was equivalent to the word citizen. This is, of
						course, conclusive on this point.</p>
					<p>During the progress of the war for the suppression of the rebellion, various
						laws were passed to raise an army sufficient for the purpose. It was found
						that some persons resorted to different disreputable ways to avoid the
						draft, and others deserted the service. To prevent a repetition of the
						former, and to punish the latter offence, Congress enacted a law partly as
						follows, viz:</p>
					<p>"An Act to amend the several acts heretofore passed to
							provide for the enrolling and rolling out of the national forces, and
							for other purposes." Approved March 3, 1863.</p>
					<p>"SECT 21. That in addition to the other lawful penalties of the crime of
						desertion from the military or naval service, all persons who have deserted the military or naval service of the
						United States, who shall not return to said service, or report themselves to
						the Provost Marshal within sixty days after the proclamation hereinafter
						mentioned, shall be deemed and taken to have voluntarily relinquished and
						forfeited THEIR RIGHTS OF CITIZENSHIP, and their rights to become citizens;
						and such Deserters shall be forever incapable of holding any office of trust
						or profit under the United States, or of exercising any
							rights of citizens thereof; and all persons who shall hereafter
						desert the military or naval service, and all persons who, being duly
						enrolled, shall depart the jurisdiction of the district in which he is
						enrolled, or go beyond the [illeg] of the United States with intent to avoid
						any draft into the military or naval service duly ordered, shall be liable
						to the penalties of this section. And the President is hereby authorized and
						required forthwith, on the passage of this act, to issue his proclamation
						setting forth the provisions of this section, in which proclamation the
						President is requested to notify all Deserters returning within sixty days
						as aforesaid, that they shall be pardoned on condition of returning to their
						regiments and companies, or to such other organizations as they may be
						assigned to, until they shall have served for a period of time equal to
						their original term of enlistment."</p>
					<p>In pursuance of that Act of Congress, President Lincoln issued his
						Proclamation.</p>
					<p>If this Act of Congress is constitutional, and applies to those persons who,
						before its passage, had been citizens of Pennsylvania, and are guilty of the
						offences described in the Act, then it is perfectly clear that such persons
						have forfeited their rights of citizenship, and cannot vote. We hold that
						the Act of Congress is strictly constitutional.</p>
					<p>Prior to the passage of the Act of 1860 (Penal Code) a convict, who had
						served his time in prison, could not vote.</p>
					<p>The first article, eighth section, of the Constitution of the United States,
						among other things, declares:<br> "1. Congress shall have power -- <br>
						"2. To lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises, to pay the debts
							and provide for the common defence and general
							welfare of the United States.<br> "5. To establish a uniform
						rule of naturalization.<br> "12. To declare war.<br> "13. To raise and
						support armies.<br> "15. To make rules for the
							government and regulations of the land and naval forces.<br>
						"16. To provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the
						Union, SUPPRESS INSURRECTIONS and repel invasions.<br> "19. To make all
						laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying
							into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested
						by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any
						department of offices thereof."</p>
					<p>Prior to the passage of the Act of 1863, which imposes the penalty of loss of
						citizenship upon Deserters, Congress had passed several Acts for the
						"raising of armies" and to "suppress insurrections," and had also made
						"certain rules for the regulation of the land and naval forces," -- Chief
						among these was the Act of March 3, 1863, usually known as the "Conscription
						Act," a part of the provisions of which are hereinafter inserted.</p>
					<p>The constitutional power of Congress to pass this Act, and their general
						power to raise armies, are fully vindicated and sustained by the Supreme
						Court of Pennsylvania in the Philadelphia cases reported in 9th Wright, 295
						and following. In these opinions the liability of drafted men to the rules
						and regulations of war are clearly set forth. The constitutionality of the
						law cannot be doubted. We are equally clear that it applies to citizens of
						Pennsylvania, and that a person cannot lose his "citizenship of the United
						States" and retain his citizenship of Pennsylvania. We find in the
						Constitution of the United States:</p>
					<p>ARTICLE VI.<br> "SECTION 2--THIS CONSTITUTION, AND THE LAWS OF THE UNITED
						STATES, WHICH SHALL BE MADE IN PURSUANCE THEREOF, and all treaties made, or
						which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, SHALL BE THE
						SUPREME LAW OF THE LAND; and the Judges in every State shall be bound
						thereby, anything in the Constitution of laws of any
							State to the contrary notwithstanding."</p>
					<p>The Supreme Court of the United States have ruled as follows:<br> "Since the
						adoption of the Constitution no states can, by
						any subsequent law, make a foreigner, or any other
							description of persons, citizens of the United States, nor
						entitle them to the rights and privileges secured to citizens by that
						instrument." 19 How., 393; also, 21 Law Rep.</p>
					<p>It is a well established fact, and indeed a constitutional command, that the
						system of naturalization shall be general, and no State can regulate the
						subject to suit its own views. It is not possible that any person can be a
						citizen of the State in which he lives, and not be a citizen of the United
						States. Nor is it possible that he can be a citizen of the United States and
						not be a citizen of the State in which he lives. The opinion of Attorney
						General Bates, given November 29th, 1862, on the question of citizenship,
						sustains this position. He says:</p>
					<p>"The phrase 'a citizen of the United States,' without addition or
						qualification, means neither more nor less than a member of the nation. And
						all such are, politically and legally, equal--the child in the cradle and
						its father in the Senate, are equally citizens of the United States. And it
						needs no argument to prove that every citizen of a State is, necessarily, a
						citizen of the United States; and to me it is equally clear that every
						citizen of the United States is a citizen of the particular State in which
						he is domiciled."</p>
					<p>"Every citizen of the United States is a competent member of the nation, with
						rights and duties under the Constitution and laws of the United States,
						which cannot be destroyed or abridged by the laws of any particular State.
							The laws of the State, if they conflict with the
							laws of the Nation, are of no force. The Constitution is plain
						beyond [illeg] on this point. Art. 6, 'This Constitution and the laws of the
						United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties,
						etc. shall be the supreme law of the land, and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, anything in
						the Constitution or laws of any State
						notwithstanding.' And from this I assume that every person who is a citizen
						of the United States, whether by birth or naturalization, holds his great
						franchise by the laws of the United States, and above
							the control of any particular State. Citizenship of the United
						States is an integral thing, incapable of existence in fractional parts.
						Whoever, then, has that franchise, is a whole citizen, and a citizen of a
						whole nation, and cannot be (as the argument of my learned predecessor seems
						to suppose) such citizen in one State and not in another."</p>
					<p>The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania agree with Judge Bates in his definition of
						the word "citizen." In 1 Grant, p. 424, Judge Woodward says:<br> "So was
						the word 'citizen' well understood, as it is now understood, to mean a human
						being--a natural person, capable of acting, contracting, suing and being
						sued without legislative aids--a person of whom allegiance is predicable,
						and who may be guilty of treason."</p>
					<p>In 7 Penn. Law Journal, page 115, Van Metre vs. Mitchell, Judge Grier
						decides:<br> "No State legislation can interfere with the provisions of an
						act of Congress, or protect from punishment any one who may incur a penalty
						prescribed by such act."</p>
					<p>Let us now ascertain who are "Deserters" contemplated by the act of Congress
						taking away the right of citizenship. The inquiry is rendered simply by a
						reference to the act itself and the law regulating the "military and naval
						services," from which desertions are alleged to be made. This act was known
						as the "Conscription Bill," and was in part as follows:</p>
					<p>An Act for enrolling and calling out the national forces,
							and for other purposes, approved March 3d, 1863.<br> "SECT.
						8--That in each of said districts there shall be a board of enrollment, to
						be composed of the Provost Marshal, as President, and two other persons, to
						be appointed by the President of the United States, one of whom shall be a
						licensed and practising physician and surgeon."<br> SECT. 12--After
						ordering a draft, this section proceeds: "And the persons so drawn shall be
						notified of the same within ten days thereafter, by a written or printed
						notice, to be served personally, or by leaving a copy at
							the last place of residence, requiring them to appear at a
						designated rendezvous to report for duty."<br> SECT 13-- ...And any persons
						failing to report after due service of notice as herein prescribed, without
						furnishing a substitute, or paying the required sum therefor, SHALL BE
						DEEMED A DESERTER, and shall be arrested by the Provost Marshal, and sent to
						the nearest military post for trial by court-martial, unless upon proper
						showing that he is not liable to do military duty, the board of enrollment
						shall relieve him from the draft."</p>
					<p>On the 24th of February, 1864, Congress passed another law, which read as
						follows:<br> SECT. 16--"That copies of any
						record of a Provost Marshal, or board of enrollment, or of any part thereof, certified by the Provost
						Marshal, or a majority of said board of enrollment, shall be deemed and taken as evidence in any civil or military
						court in like manner as the original record; provided that if any person
						shall knowingly certify any false copy or copies of such record, to be used
						in any civil or military court, he shall be subject to the pains and
						penalties of perjury."</p>
					<p>How are Deserters to be known? It will be seen from the 16th section of the
						Act above quoted that copies of papers, duly certified by the Board of
						Enrollment or by the Provost Marshal, shall be evidence. Under the system
						regulating elections in Pennsylvania, the judges and inspectors compose the
						tribunal by which must be determined all questions (prima facie) touching the right to vote of all persons claiming
						the right of suffrage. From them an appeal lies to the tribunals provided
						for the trial of contested elections. But the board of judges and inspectors
						must first decide. They must determine whether the applicant is over or
						under twenty-one years of age; whether he is white or black; whether he has
						or has not resided within the State or the election district a sufficient
						length of time to entitle him to vote. They must also determine whether he
						is sane or an idiot or madman; whether he is a native or a foreigner, and if
						a foreigner whether he has been naturalized, and any other question which
						may arise under the law. All this they do by examining witnesses and hearing
						evidence, as directed by the law or as indicated by their own good sense.
						There is nothing in this new duty, growing out of the questions of
						desertion, more difficult than these duties. If the books of the Provost
						Marshal or enrolment board show an individual to be a Deserter, and he
						claims to be innocent of the charge, he will have no trouble in producing
						papers or witnesses to show that at the time of the draft made in which he
						was drawn he was serving the country as a volunteer, or that having
						deserted, he returned under the proclamation of sixty days' amnesty and was
						pardoned, or show some other legal defence. It will be observed that the
							person who left his district or his country to avoid
							the draft, and who was subsequently drawn, and had notice left at his
							last known place of residence, is as much a deserter as he who
						ran away after having been duly mustered into the service.</p>
					<p>The authorities already produced appear to be conclusive of the subject. But
						there is still another view of the question which is equally decisive. The
						right of expatriation has been recognized by the laws of nations from a very
						early period in history. It was regarded as one of the firmest foundations
						of Roman liberty, that the Roman citizen had the privilege to stay or
						renounce his residence in the State at pleasure. It is conceded that this
						doctrine has been differently held by different nations. It has been
						definitely and conclusively settled in the United States that the right of
						election (choice of allegiance) exists in every citizen. This view is taken
						by Chancellor Kent. 2 Kent; 39 &amp;c.</p>
					<p>The doctrine is thoroughly discussed and fully established by the Supreme
						Court of the United States in the case of Inglis vs. Trustees of Sailor's
						Song Harbor--3 Peters, 305; and also in the case of Shanks vs. Dupont--same
						book, 395. In these two cases all the authorities and decisions bearing upon
						this question are fully cited and explained. Indeed, it is now the
						well-settled and undisputed law of the United States, that the citizen may
						surrender his right of citizenship, or may withdraw or change his
						allegiance. Our naturalization laws are founded entirely upon the soundness
						of this position. Pennsylvania adopted this view of the law at an early
						period of her history. In the case of Jackson vs. Burns, 3 Binn 85, Chief
						Justice Tilghman, in delivering the opinion of the Supreme Court, said: "The
						principle of the English law, that no man could, even for the most pressing
						reasons, divest himself of the allegiance under which he was born, is not
						compatible with the Constitution of Pennsylvania."</p>
					<p>By an examination of the authorities it will be seen that the only objection
						to the universality of this doctrine of change of allegiance arises from a
						want of consent in the Government. In the case now under consideration, the
						Congress of the United States having passed the act forfeiting the right of
						citizenship, consent of the Government is thereby given, and the question is
						rendered free from all doubt. In discussing the right and power of an
						individual to surrender his right of citizenship, Senator Wallace, now
						Chairman of the Democratic State Central Committee, when opposing the
						extension of the right of suffrage to soldiers, declared:</p>
					<p>"It is said that so meritorious a class as volunteer soldiery should not be
						disfranchised. To this I answer that neither the Constitution of 1790 nor
						that of 1838 conferred this privilege, and that the act of the soldier in
						taking upon himself duties that are from their nature incompatible with the
						right of suffrages, deprives him of this privilege. HE DISFRANCHISES HIMSELF
							when he ceases to be a citizen and takes upon
						himself the duties of a soldier." Legislative Record of 1864, p. 339.</p>
					<p>From this it would appear that all parties concede the right and power of the
						individual, voluntarily, to surrender his right of citizenship. If he lost
						his right of voting by going into the service of his country, as here
						asserted by the Democratic Chairman, it is contended that much more justly
						did he lose that right by running away from that service.</p>
					<p>Nothing is better settled than the rule of law that when one party to a
						contract refuses to fulfill his stipulations, the other is not bound. The
						man who sells his neighbor a horse and refuses to deliver him has just as
						much right to collect the price as the deserter, bounty-jumper, Western or
						Canadian refugee has to demand the right to suffrage, after refusing to obey
						the call of his country in her time of need.</p>
					<p>A single objection to the views here presented needs to be briefly met. This
						objection is raised by the friends of Deserters--for even they have friends
						about election times. They argue that these persons cannot be deprived of
						the right of voting without a trial--without process of law, &amp;c. In
						answer to this position, we say that the Act of Congress itself is "process
						of law."</p>
					<p>The conscription bills of 1863 and 1864 establish the board of enrollment as
						a tribunal to hear and determine all questions connected with the draft,
						exemption, &amp;c. Their powers and duties are fully and clearly set
						forth, and carefully and extensively defined. There is much of the "process
						of law" embraced within their provisions. When a debtor is sued, the writ is
						often served by a copy left at his residence with some member of his family,
						judgment goes by default, and his property is seized and sold to satisfy the
						demand. The conscription law provides the same method of giving notice, and
						the results of his failure to report in time are clearly set forth, and
						fully made known to him by the law.</p>
					<p>It is however confidently maintained, that the terms of the Constitution,
						relied upon by those who sustain the cause of Deserters, such as "trial,"
						"due process of law," &amp;c., do not apply to cases of this kind. This
						defence could not be set up by the citizen against the Crown in England, nor
						will it avail him against his Government in the country. The very same
						section of the same article of the Constitution of the United States which
						authorizes Congress to raise armies and to provide rules for the regulation
						of the army and navy, authorized Congress to lay and collect taxes, duties,
						&amp;c., "and to make all laws which may be
							necessary and proper for carrying into execution these powers."
						When the power is given to Congress to lay and collect taxes and to raise
						armies, this power is not to be defeated by allowing the citizen privileges
						which would effectually defeat the end proposed. The citizen cannot
						interpose against the proceedings of Congress adopted for either of those
						purposes, his right of "trial," or the plea that his personal rights or his
						property are being taken from him without "due process of law." This appears
						to have been the unanimous opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States
						in 18 Howard, 272. The whole question is there fully examined and reviewed
						by the Court, and both the opinion and judgment fully sustain the view here
						taken. The decision of this question must be conclusive of the question. On
						this point Judge Woodward says:</p>
					<p>"I am to take the instrument in the sense in which it is received by the
						majority of the Supreme Court of the United States. Among the judicial
						tribunals of the country, if not in other departments and places, that Court
						is the supreme and final arbiter of questions under the Federal
						Constitution. The respect entertained for members of that bench makes that
						duty of following them, on a constitutional question, easy and pleasant,
						which the theory of the government makes imperative." 1 Grant, 424.</p>
					<p>The Constitution and laws of the United States and of Pennsylvania, the
						Supreme Court of the United States and of our own State; common sense,
						common honesty and common justice seem to agree in the power, the right and
						justice of the Act disfranchising Deserters.</p>
					<p>John Cessna,<br> Chairman Union State Central Committee. </p>
