					<p>When the war of the rebellion was precipitated, the then authorities at
						Washington, calculated that sixty thousand men and three months would be
						sufficient force and time to crush the plot of treason. It is not necessary
						now to refer to the fact that this calculation of a force of necessity to
						arrest rebellion was woefully wrong, and that instead of requiring three
						months, four years, four terrible, weary, bloody, and self-sacrificing years
						were consumed in the struggle to restore the Union to peace. But it is a
						curious fact that one of the States of the Union has furnished almost five
						times as many men to aid in crushing rebellion as was at first demanded of
						all the States, to accomplish that result.</p>
					<p>On inquiry in the office of the Adjutant General, A. L. Russell, for
						information relative to the full number of men furnished by the State of
						Pennsylvania, as recruits for the armies of the Republic, we were placed in
						possession of the following letter:</p>
					<p>WAR DEPARTMENT, PRO. MAR. GEN.'S OFFICE,<lb/> Washington, D.C., Sept. 2,
							1865<lb/><emph rend="italic">His Excellency, A. G. Curtin, Governor of
							Pennsylvania:</emph></p>
					<p>SIR: I have the honor to inform you that the number of men furnished by the
						State of Pennsylvania from April 17, 1861, to April 20, 1865, is three
						hundred and sixty-one thousand nine hundred and thirty-nine (361,939)
						without reference to period of service, which varied from three months to
						three years. Please acknowledge the receipt.</p>
					<p>I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant, JAMES
						H. FRY, Pro. Mar. Gen.</p>
					<p>The number of men credited to Pennsylvania, in the foregoing official account
						tallies so closely with the records that we are willing to accept it as
						correct. But there are other official records besides those kept at
						Washington of men furnished by Pennsylvania, to aid in crushing the
						rebellion, which greatly swell the aggregate force we sent into the fields.
						These records show, that for State defence and in response to the demands of
						sudden emergencies, Pennsylvania put into the field at various times a force
						of between 86,000 and 90,000 men. On several occasions we had a cordon of
						bayonets stretched along the southern border of the State. Then again, the
						number of men who were induced to leave the State for enlistment in other
						States, was very large. The border counties of New York along the entire
						border line, were paying heavy bounties before the counties in this State
						along the same line, offered pecuniary inducements for enlistments. The same
						inducements were offered to citizens of Pennsylvania by other border States.
						An entire regiment was raised in the western counties of Pennsylvania for
						Western Virginia. In New Jersey, for a time enlistments were largely
						discouraged by the copperhead leaders, so that loyal men in districts in
						that State, anxious to fill up their quotas, were compelled to find
						substitutes through the influence of heavy bounties offered to the people of
						Pennsylvania. Nor was it only the States immediately on our border that
						filled their quotas from among our citizens. States on the Pacific coast did
						the same; in proof of which we need only refer to the fact that a full
						regiment was recruited in the city of Philadelphia, for the State of
						California, a regiment afterwards commanded by one of the California United
						States Senators. Carefully estimating the men thus raised and enlisted in
						various localities, we put down the aggregate number of troops thus
						furnished by Pennsylvania at 25,000. Indeed, so great was this drain on our
						military resources that the Legislature passed a law sternly forbidding the
						enlistment of men within the borders of the State for service in the
						organizations of other States, and districts emphatically declared that the
						families of those thus leaving the Commonwealth, should not receive the
						benefits of the relief offered to the families of the soldiers in
						Pennsylvania organizations. Nor must we forget the large number of colored
						troops that were enlisted in Pennsylvania for other States. At least 2,500
						colored troops went into service in other States, who were taken out of
						Pennsylvania. Taking these figures at fair estimates we have the following:</p>
					<p><emph rend="italic">Recapitulation of Troops Furnished by the State of
							Pennsylvania, to Aid in Restoring the National Authority in the Revolted
							States:</emph><lb/> Number of men regularly furnished and accounted for
						by the Provost Marshal of the United States, 361,939.<lb/> Number of men in
						the aggregate called at various times to meet emergencies growing out of the
						attempted invasions of the North by the rebel army of Northern Virginia,
						96,000.<lb/> Number of men who left Pennsylvania to enlist in other States,
						25,000.<lb/> Number of colored men who left Pennsylvania to enlist in the
						organizations of other States, on account of there being no opportunity for
						colored troops to enlist in this States, 2,500.<lb/> Aggregate number of
						troops furnished by the State of Penn'a to sustain the National Authority,
						479,459.</p>
					<p>The above is a record of which the State may well feel proud, and taken in
						connection with the other fact--the reduction of our State debt--reflects
						honor and credit upon the patriotism and fidelity of the people of the
						Keystone State and their public servants, who administered its affairs.</p>

				<summary>In an attempt to gauge Pennsylvania's contribution of the war effort, the
					article discusses the various records detailing the number of men furnished by
					the state to the armies of the Republic. The task is made difficult, it notes,
					because several thousand men from Pennsylvania enlisted in regiments outside of
					the state, taking advantage of the superior bounties offered elsewhere.</summary>

				<head>The Senatorial Question</head>
				<origin/>
				<commentary/>
				<excerpt/>
				<transcript>
					<p>
						<emph rend="italic">To the Democrats of Adams and Franklin Counties:</emph>
					</p>
					<p>According to the true theory of representative governments every voter is
						entitled to consult his individual interest in voting.</p>
					<p>By doing so, it results that all interests are represented in the
						legislature, and the general interest is consulted in the legislation of the
						country.</p>
					<p>You will be required to make the application of this great principle of
						popular government at the approaching State election. Among the questions
						affecting your interests which will come before the next legislature, there
						is one which overshadows all others. I refer to that of compensation for the
						losses which you have sustained by the rebel raids and invasions of the last
						few years. So vitally does this question affect your interests, that all
						parties and all candidates for office in these counties have been obliged to
						declare in favor of compensation.</p>
					<p>If the political parties and candidates for the State legislature in other
						counties of this State were equally favorable to this measure, it would not
						be necessary for you to consult any other interest in this election than
						that of your party. But unfortunately such is not the case.</p>
					<p>The political parties in other counties of the State have not declared in
						favor of this measure of justice and generosity to their suffering fellow
						citizens on the Southern border.</p>
					<p>They are in fact interested in opposing it, and certainly never will consent
						to it except in consequence of the most persevering and determined efforts
						on the part of your representatives.</p>
					<p>More will therefore depend on the personal character of the men whom you are
						about to select to represent you in the legislature in procuring the
						allowance of these claims, than upon their merits or upon any other cause
						whatever.</p>
					<p>While the representatives from the other sections of the State will oppose
						these claims, party leaders will endeavor to avoid the responsibility of
						their rejection by doing indirectly and covertly what they dare not do
						directly and openly.</p>
					<p>And in this they will surely succeed if your representatives do not posses
						sufficient nerve and ability to unmask their efforts and to extort from
						their fears what will be refused on an appeal to their sense of justice and
						magnanimity.</p>
					<p>Fortunately it is in your power by sacrificing party to your individual
						interests to elect at least one man of the requisite ability to represent
						you in the next legislature.</p>
					<p>I need not name the person to whom I refer. It is only necessary to describe
						the man of energy, of address, and of persistence required for the occasion,
						and all who know him personally or by reputation will instinctively
						pronounce the name of David McConaughy. I need not add that he is a
						successful lawyer and advocate with the experience of twenty years practice,
						and earnestly devoted to the cause of the Border claims.</p>
					<p>This gentleman has just been presented as a candidate for Senator by the
						Union convention, and will of course be supported by Republicans on
						political grounds. It is therefore only necessary for him to receive the
						votes of Democrats who are interested in the compensation question to be
						elected. These votes he must receive (at any hazard) or you will be without
						a representative in the Senate from the Border known to be qualified to
						successfully advocate your cause before that body.</p>
					<p>If the Democratic party, or more properly speaking its managers and leaders,
						should suffer from this preference of your own interests to theirs, the
						fault is not yours. It is that of the Democratic State Convention which
						failed to endorse the compensation proposition. It is that of the Democratic
						district convention which nominated Mr. Duncan instead of Mr. Sharpe, as its
						candidate for Senator. It is not my purpose to disparage Mr. Duncan, he is
						no doubt worthy of the nomination which he has received, though it was one
						under the circumstances, not expedient to be made.</p>
					<p>Mr. Sharpe was known to be man of mark and ability, who possessed
						considerable influence in the legislature, and had he received the
						nomination instead of Mr. Duncan, the Democrats of Franklin and Adams
						counties would have found it to be their interest to sustain him, and he
						might, even have received the votes of many Republicans who knew him better
						than Mr. M'Conaughy. But unfortunately different councils prevailed with the
						convention. A gentleman comparatively unknown and wholly untried and
						inexperienced was nominated. Will it be said that he may possess abilities
						superior to those of Mr. Sharpe, and might, if elected, come to exercise as
						great an influence in the legislature than the latter is known to have
						exerted? Surely this is no time to make experiments with new men, so far as
						the suffering voters of Southern Pennsylvania are concerned.</p>
					<p>This was a matter for the consideration of the nominating convention and it
						has been disregarded by its members, who preferred selfish or personal
						considerations to the general interest, they will have no right to complain
						if the Democratic masses prefer their own vital interests to those of their
						would be leaders. But I apprehend the party and the country will survive
						should you in the exercise of your sovereign discretion prefer your own
						interests to those of other people, as you are entitled to do according to
						the principles of your party and of our government.</p>
					<p>It has been urged by leading Republicans who are deeply interested in the
						result, that it is the true policy of the Democrats in the border counties
						to vote for representatives who are in political communion with the party in
						power both at Harrisburg and Washington, and which holds the majority vote
						which can give success to your claims.</p>
					<p>Whether there is any force in this argument or not it is not material to
						inquire, since the folly of the Democratic district convention has left the
						Democrats of Franklin and Adams no other alternative than to adopt the
						course I have suggested.</p>
					<p>These remarks are addressed to you by a Democrat who is, like yourselves,
						deeply interested in the speedy and satisfactory solution of the local
						question which for the time, so far as the people of Adams and Franklin are
						concerned, supersedes in vital importance all others of a general nature. A
						DEMOCRAT.</p>

				<summary>Because there is general feeling among legislators throughout the rest of
					Pennsylvania against indemnifying the residents of the border counties for the
					damage they suffered as a result of rebel raids during the war, the author of
					the letter insists that it is critical for the voters of Franklin county to send
					men of strength and integrity to the Legislature to fight for their best
					interests. For this reason, he endorses David McConaughy, the Union candidate,
					over his Democratic challenger, Duncan.</summary>
