                <commentary>"Hon. Thaddeus Stevens made one of his boldest speeches in Gettyburg on
                    the 3rd inst. in which he discussed the status of the Rebel States with a degree
                    of originality and pungency peculiar to himself. There is nothing new in his
                    position but is arguments are ever fresh and logical, and his keen satire on
                    time-servers is worthy of his palmiest days:"</commentary>

                <summary>A transcript of an address delivered by Thaddeus Stevens, in which the
                    Radical politician lays out his prescription for reconstructing the southern
                    states. His plan, he acknowledges, is more severe than the one offered by the
                    rebels and their sympathizers. Among other things, it calls for the confiscation
                    of the leading rebels' estates to pay the national debt, to indemnify loyal men
                    for the damages they suffered, and to relieve the burden of taxation.</summary>

                <summary>It is reported that scores of Irish immigrants have returned to their
                    homeland since the end of the war, carrying with them "revolvers, pistols,
                    rifled guns, daggers, and short swords," which they were acquired while serving
                    in the Union Army. With weapons such as these, the returnees boast, members of
                    the Fenian Brotherhood are now preparing in the U. S. for "the invasion of

                <excerpt/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>Pennsylvania is still true to her noble fame, to her heroic soldiery, to the
                        memory of her martyred dead, to the Republic rescued from treason in the
                        field and then threatened by the treacherous friendship of its deadly foes.</p>
                    <p>The same Democracy that proclaimed the war a failure but one year ago, turned
                        upon its own consistent record and sought to deceive the patriotic people it
                        could not make faithless to their government. It endorsed President Johnson,
                        with the hope of making him perfidious in case of their success, and
                        demanded that the authors of treason and war and our widespread bereavement,
                        should be restored to the power they wielded for our destruction.</p>
                    <p>They appealed to every prejudice that hates, even justice to the victims of
                        slavery, and impelled thousands to vote against their own best interest lest
                        they should be degraded by negro equality; but the profound, patriotic
                        convictions of the people have prevailed, and once more Pennsylvania
                        thunders that to faithful me, and not to traitors, shall the power and
                        destiny of this government be entrusted.</p>
                    <p>The Union party occupied no doubtful position. It had no concealment--no
                        double-dealing. It met the issues manfully and trusted to a just cause and
                        the intelligence and virtue of the people for success. Their platform is
                        explicit as to the true policy of the administration, and although assailed
                        with all the ingenuity and malignity that accomplished Democratic leaders
                        could exercise, it has triumphed solely because the people believed it
                        Right.</p>
                    <p>--There is Pennsylvania--behold her! Her voice is one of admonition to her
                        Rulers, to the South, to the Democracy, and one that bids loyal men be of
                        good cheer and hope confidently for the full fruition of the causeless,
                        bloody war with which treason appalled the Nation. Let the doubting look to
                        her sturdy sons--ever slow to accept, but equally slow to surrender--and go
                        forward in renewed faith that the Republic lives!</p>

                    <p>It will be seen that the entire Union county ticket is elected by the home
                        vote but Col. Rowe, who is eight behind; but we confidently look for more
                        than enough of soldier votes to elect him. The vote cast in the county is
                        7109--574 less than that cast for President last year. It is however 134
                        more than the vote, home and army vote together, cast for Congress last
                        year, and is therefore a very respectable poll for a quiet election. We
                        presume that there are not ten counties in the State where the vote has been
                        as full as in Franklin. The Union men have done nobly, and assured their
                        supremacy in the "Green Spot."</p>
                    <p>In order to show the variations in the vote of Franklin county during the
                        last twelve years, we append the vote of each party, the aggregate vote and
                        the majority each year from 1854 until now, including the vote at both
                        elections in 1864. It will be seen that in that period Franklin county has
                        given a Democratic majority but once--in 1857 when there were two candidates
                        (Wilmot and Hazelhurst) opposed to the Democracy, and the majority has
                        varied from 17 to 779, and the total vote from 5271 to 7683. The largest
                        Republican vote was 4053 cast for Lincoln in 1860, and the lowest was 2860
                        cast for Nicholson for Canal Commissioner in 1855. The highest Democratic
                        was 3821 cast for McClellan in 1864 and the lowest 2411 cast for Plummer in
                        1855:</p>

                    <p>Lancaster, Oct. 15, 9 PM--Yesterday afternoon as the day express train
                        [illeg] on the Pennsylvania Railroad was within four miles of this city, an
                        axle of the head passenger car broke, and a part of it striking the bottom
                        of the car, near the front end, tore out part of the bottom, precipitating
                        the occupants off their seats, on each side, to the ground, who were run
                        over by the wheels of the rear truck. Eight persons were killed outright and
                        another died some hours afterwards. Only two others were badly hurt. The
                        train consisted of seven passenger and two baggage cars. The last four cars
                        were thrown off the track, one of which was turned on its side. No one in
                        these cars were seriously hurt.</p>
                    <p>The accident occurred nearly opposite Mrs. Kauffman's mill, in a cut in the
                        road, nearly midway between Lancaster and Landisville. The passengers were
                        immediately brought to Lancaster, where preparations were made to administer
                        to the wants of the wounded, the entire medical force of the city being
                        assembled at the depot as soon as the news of the accident reached here.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Barr, one of the killed, was the wife of Hon. James P. Barr, of
                        Pittsburgh, Surveyor-General of Pennsylvania.<lb/> Col. Butler, killed, was
                        whiskey inspector in Philadelphia.<lb/> W. H. Butler, Clerk in the
                        Surveyor-General's office, Pennsylvania.<lb/> Mrs. Willet, killed, was the
                        wife of Theo. Willet of New Cumberland, Pa.<lb/> The three children who were
                        with Mrs. Yetta of Milwaukee, state that their father had died in the South,
                        and that they were going to an aunt in Philadelphia, whose name they could
                        not give. </p>
                    <p>Three females, evidently a mother and two daughters, and apparently Germans,
                        supposed to be recently from California, have not yet been identified. One
                        of the girls may have been fifteen and the other nine years of age. All the
                        bodies, except that of Mrs. Yetta and the three not identified, have been
                        sent to their relatives. The others have been temporarily deposited in a
                        vault in one of our cemeteries.</p>
                    <p>Colonel Isaac Moffet, of Philadelphia, it is supposed, was somewhat injured
                        internally. He is the only one known to have received serious injury.</p>
                    <p>The train was running on schedule time and at the usual rate of speed. The
                        breaking of the axle, which was the cause of the accident, appears to have
                        been an unavoidable occurrence.</p>
                    <p>The officers of the Company here have been active and unremitting in their
                        efforts to minister to the comforts of the wounded. Much difficulty has been
                        experienced in identifying the bodies of some of the dead. The solicitor of
                        the Company for this district has spared no exertion to secure the
                        identification of some of the dead.</p>
