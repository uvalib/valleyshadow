                    giving contradictory reasons and demands a "sensible explanation" or none at
                    all.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Gen. Coffroth has written an elaborate letter to Mr. Weyland of Somerset in
                        defence of his vote in favor of the amendment to the constitution abolishing
                        slavery, and in vindication of his consistency as a Democrat; but he seems
                        to have failed to satisfy Mr. Weyland "or any other man" on that side of the
                        House. From this extraordinary epistle we learn that Gen. Coffroth knew in
                        advance that when he cast his vote his "political enemies, in order to
                        exasperate Democrats, would be fulsome in their praise," and he adds "I
                        feared more the praise of my political foes than I did the criticism of my
                        friends." As to the criticism of his friends, we cannot pretend to speak
                        advisedly; but we are not perspicacious enough to see where the "fulsome"
                        adulation of his enemies comes in. He will bear as a witness that we have
                        not been malicious enough to speak well of him in terms of unusual
                        extravagance, and we are not aware that any of the Union journals of the
                        district have been so ungenerous as to damn him with violent approbation;
                        while it must be confessed that the criticism of the Democracy has been
                        rather more candid than complimentary. We assure Gen. Coffroth also by way
                        of "indemnity for the past and security for the future," that we shall be
                        more careful hereafter not to shock his sensibilities with rude
                        commendations relative to his Congressional career. To the best of our
                        knowledge he has cast but one vote on the side of patriotism during two
                        sessions, and that he has been persistently trying to explain into suspicion
                        or positive disrepute ever since. Rest easy, General, you shall not fall by
                        the "fulsome" praise of your foes.</p>
                    <p>But Gen. Coffroth goes into the future. When no one was accusing him in any
                        public manner of a disreputable compact with certain Republicans to secure a
                        seat in the next Congress, in the face of his defeat by the people, he
                        rushes to his own vindication, and insists that if any person should happen
                        to think he was so influenced in his vote, they must be at once undeceived.
                        He gives the world to know that he don't affiliate with Republicans, or
                        Abolitionists as he calls them. He did not mean to give vitality to the
                        Republicans by his vote, but he launched it forth upon them with death and
                        widespread destruction. He says--"I assure the abolitionists that are now
                        praising me, I did not vote for the amendment on account of any love for
                        their party or their principles, but it was to stab
                            them!</p>
                    <p>Thus while Coffroth has been censured by thoughtless friends for supporting a
                        favorite dogma of the Republicans, he was in fact playing the part of
                        political assassin and meant by one grand sweep of strategy to kill and
                        entomb the opposition to the Democracy. So far from being the apostate of
                        Democracy, he would prove himself the Brutus of Republicanism and go down in
                        history as the hero who bought gifts to weave in chaplets for the dead. When
                        the impartial limner comes to paint the startling events of the last
                        Congress and the death of the Republican organization, the central figure of
                        that panorama must be the Brutus of the 16th district, with the dying party
                        uttering its last sad words--Et tute Coffroth!</p>
                    <p>Two reasons are given in detail by Gen. Coffroth for the vote in question. He
                        voted for the amendment to destroy the Republican party by destroying
                        slavery and again he tells his constituents that he voted for it to run a
                        corner on the President because the States would inevitably defeat its
                        adoption! Profoundly logical! Since both propositions cannot be accepted,
                        will the General oblige us with a brief letter of not over several columns
                        telling us just what he did mean when he cast the vote for the amendment?
                        Had he been silent, his vote would have needed no explanation. It would have
                        stood forever as a record of which himself and his children could have been
                        proud; but since he has given half a score of reasons for it at different
                        times, no two of which harmonize with each other, and all of which confront
                        the vote itself, we beg the General to give us one sensible explanation of
                        his explanations, and then--stop!</p>
