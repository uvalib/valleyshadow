                    County Convention. McLellan discusses the issues that will form the core of the

                    farmers from the state's border region, black suffrage, and President Johnson's

                <transcript>
                    <p>We are now within a short month of the October election. There have been
                        issues of more immediate moment in past political conflicts, when the very
                        life of the Republic trembled in the scale; but never had Pennsylvania a
                        more solemn duty to perform, touching the future peace and safety of the
                        Nation, than that devolved upon the faithful people by the vital issues of
                        the pending contest.</p>
                    <p>If Pennsylvania shall falter, there is not a despairing traitor who will not
                        take fresh courage in his work to embarrass the happy restoration of the
                        revolted States; there is not a foe of free government or of freedom who
                        will not be glad; there is not a sordid, faithless devotee of repudiation
                        who will not rejoice that, even after armed treason has been overthrown, the
                        great Republic of the World may yet be shorn of its strength and the lustre
                        of its triumphs dimmed by the destruction of its credit.</p>
                    <p>Loyal Men of Pennsylvania!--you who have with unfaltering faith upheld the
                        cause of the government in the darkest days with which murderous treason
                        shadowed us--you who have given freely of your sons as martyrs to a holy
                        cause, and withheld not your means when imperiled credit threatened to give
                        triumph to the foe--there are but few days for thorough organization; for
                        patient, tireless, systematic work; and the success of the Union ticket
                        depends wholly upon the fidelity with which you discharge that duty. If we
                        shall prove faithless, the better discipline and ceaseless efforts of the
                        Democracy will prevail.</p>
                    <p>Immediate and thorough organization only will save Pennsylvania this fall.
                        Our opponents are well prepared for the conflict. They have ceased not to
                        prepare for the struggle since the overthrow of the rebellion gave them new
                        issues under which to hide their substantial aid and sympathy with treason
                        during the war, for which they were so overwhelmingly condemned by the
                        people. They have now new banners, with new devices, and where their
                        heaviest artillery thundered before they come with gifts more to be dreaded
                        than their blows.</p>
                    <p>They profess to accept the results of the war, and yet quibble with and
                        respond to every complaining traitor whose treason and wanton sacrifice of
                        hundreds of thousands of lives and countless treasure, have won but a tithe
                        of their just penalties. They seek to disarm the loyal people by professing
                        to sustain President Johnson, and yet they denounce his daily acts, and
                        plead the cause of every assassin who is overtaken by justice. They declare
                        that the National faith must be maintained, and yet not a journal or orator
                        of their faith but denounces every measure of the government devised to
                        preserve our credit--the only safety and the chief peril of the Republic.</p>
                    <p>They will poll their full vote. In the North-east, they will do quite as well
                        as last year. There is not a skulking conscript who will not now return to
                        vote in behalf of the remnant of the treason whose triumph he sought to
                        insure by deserting honor, home and country. In defiance of the law justly
                        disfranchising them, they will vote, and swell the thousands of majority
                        which so nearly made Pennsylvania a suicide one year ago. Other thousands in
                        Schuylkill, Luzerne, Carbon, Lehigh, Northampton, Monroe, Pike and Wayne,
                        who have concealed or postponed their naturalization until now, in order to
                        evade the defence of the government they have adopted, will now swarm upon
                        the assessments and rejoice with the Hughes's, Reeds, Woodwards,
                        &amp;c., when their immense majorities are announced.</p>
                    <p>In the Southern counties--those South of the Juniata and Susquehanna and East
                        of the Alleghenies, we cannot materially improve the October vote of last
                        year. It is possible to reduce the crushing majorities of York, Cumberland,
                        Adams, Fulton and Bedford a thousand; but more is not to be expected--less
                        may be the result.</p>
                    <p>Philadelphia must fall off essentially in her vote, because the vast
                        manufacturing for the army has been almost wholly arrested, and thousands of
                        government employees and operatives on government work of various kinds have
                        been scattered in other channels of industry over the country. Their
                        reduction must diminish the large Union majority of last year from 2,500 to
                        3,000, and the adjoining county of Delaware can scarcely fail to be
                        similarly effected by the same causes.</p>
                    <p>The success of the Union ticket depends wholly on the organization and full
                        vote of Lancaster, Dauphin, Somerset, Bradford, Susquehanna, Tioga, Erie,
                        Crawford, Indiana, Lawrence, Allegheny, &amp;c. If these Union
                        strong-holds shall be systematically and thoroughly organized and polled, we
                        shall carry the State by a decisive majority. If they fail, as they did last
                        year in October, the State will inevitably be lost.</p>
                    <p>Loyal men of the Union counties!--forewarned forearmed! The issue of this
                        momentous struggle is with you, and upon your verdict will the verdict of
                        the State depend. The Union State Committee is, we are assured, pressing
                        organization and discharging its duty with matchless energy; but without
                        complete local co-operation, it cannot insure the triumph the Union cause
                        should attain. There is still time enough for Work, FOR VICTORY! Close up
                        the Union ranks--forward the whole line, and the people of Pennsylvania will
                        be faithful to their past history--to their martyred sons; to their noblest
                        inheritance, to Freedom, Justice and a redeemed Republic!</p>

                <summary>With the state elections less than a month away, say the editors,
                    Republicans of Franklin county must mobilize to ensure that Pennsylvania does
                    not wind up in the hands of the traitorous Democrats. It is particularly
                    important for the "Unionists" to get "systematically and thoroughly organized
                    and polled" this year, they claim, because the state is closely divided,
                    therefore, Franklin, as well as other "Union strong-holds" such as Lancaster,
                    Somerset, and Bradford, will play an important role in determining which way the
                    election turns out.</summary>

                <transcript>
                    <p>We deeply, indeed profoundly, sympathize with the Bedford <emph rend="italic"
                            >Gazette</emph> and the Bedford Democracy generally. They have more than
                        their share of sorrow. They have lost elections; they have lost a war; they
                        have lost agonizing conscripts; they have lost offices; they have lost the
                        loaves and fishes; they have lost hopeful sons for a season in the rebel
                        armies; have lost upright, eminently order-loving citizens from their social
                        circle for the mere eccentricity of murdering a Deputy Provost Marshal and
                        enlisting in the rebel army to devastate their own homes; and to crown their
                        deluge of grief, the Ethiopian now threatens to arise from his abject
                        degradation, marry their daughters, confiscate their lands, and crack the
                        master's whip about their loins as they go forth from day to day to
                        unrequited toil. We keenly sympathize with them, for--<lb/> "Like warp and
                        woof all destinies<lb/> Are woven fast."<lb/> And when the dark day of
                        Ethiopian dominion shall come, none can escape the terrible doom--"the
                        paining jar through all will run." Well does the <emph rend="italic"
                        >Gazette</emph> proclaim the danger. "Arouse! Arouse!" it thunders to its
                        imperiled readers, and decide "whether <emph rend="italic">you</emph> shall
                        continue to be the dominant race in this country." Whether the historic
                        hills and fastnesses of Bedford, which have been hitherto sacred to
                        bounty-jumpers and skulking conscripts, shall henceforth resound the broad,
                        deep, sonorous voice of the lordly African calling his Meyers's, Shannons
                        and Reeds--his unwilling but yet subdued and obedient serfs--to their daily
                        tasks; or whether they shall remain, as now, the recipients of the priceless
                        religious, civil and social blessings conferred on them by a government they
                        have rewarded with the deepest hate and the most persistent efforts to
                        destroy it. Such is the issue--so fraught with weal or woe; so pregnant with
                        the question of dominion between the sable and the pale faces of our Western
                        citizens. The <emph rend="italic">Gazette</emph> has read Jefferson--the
                        father of Democracy--and it remembers that, in consequence of Slavery, he
                        trembled for his country when he reflected "that God is just; that His
                        justice cannot sleep forever; that considering numbers, nature and natural
                        means only, a revolution of the wheel of fortune, an exchange of situation
                        is among possible events; that it may become probable by supernatural
                        interference," and that "the Almighty has no attribute which can take side
                        with us in such a contest!" Well has the <emph rend="italic">Gazette</emph>
                        trembled, and it and its sorrow-stricken followers--<lb/> "Thus roving
                        on<lb/> In confus'd march forlorn, th' advent'rous band,<lb/> With
                        shuddering horror pale, and eyes aghast,<lb/> Viewed their lamentable lot,
                        and found--<lb/> No rest!"<lb/> The Ethiopian is omnipresent with them.
                        Their dreams are shadowed by sable nightmares; their waking hours are made
                        hideous by dark apparitions ever flitting before them; the lash and chains
                        are ever clanking and whirling in their ears, and they are at last driven to
                        that depth of despair where "hope ne'er dawns and pleasure never smiles." In
                        starless midnight of their grief they cry to themselves and to their
                        followers to "Arouse! Arouse!" for the African is at their doors, and with
                        grimly smile he rattles the dead bones of a million of his sleeping race,
                        cursed, brutalized and benighted by man, each one crying for that vengeance
                        which God has "no attribute" to interpose and break its fearful sweep.</p>
                    <p>In clarity we would whisper philosophy to the palpitating hearts of the
                        Bedford Democracy. How much they merit the fearful doom that makes them
                        utter the cry of despair, lest the African may win distinction over those so
                        sparingly endowed as the Democratic leaders of Bedford, we do not pretend to
                        decide; but we assure them that all needful protection shall be awarded
                        them. If it must be so, we shall favor statutory interdiction to protect the
                            <emph rend="italic">Gazette</emph> from the competition of a better and
                        abler democratic organ being published by a sable son of the South, or even
                        one of mingled African and lordly Democratic blood. If they fear that the
                        disenthralled slave shall outstrip them in the learned professions; shall
                        make their fields to blossom with still richer fruits; shall shame them into
                        the support of truth and justice as voters at the polls; shall win popular
                        elections by honest suffrages rather than by manipulating election returns;
                        shall gather their daughters in marriage over their paler rivals, and, in
                        short, make Democracy and the <emph rend="italic">Gazette</emph> forget
                        their cunning, and draw them step by step from power to the voluntary
                        surrender of dominion--if these are to be the inevitable fruits of the
                        freedom of the benighted bondman, when his untuned chords shall strike in
                        painful melody with the fine-strung social strains of his oppressor, then
                        must there be law to save the <emph rend="italic">Gazette</emph> and its

                            rend="italic">Gazette</emph>. Jefferson's appalling prophecy will fall
                        short of fulfillment, for the reason that the God of justice did not sleep
                        until the slave worked out his own redemption. His proud, insolent,
                        traitorous lords, and their cowardly, coppery serfs of the North, hastened
                        the triumph of Freedom, though they marked its victorious path with rivers
                        of gore. The slave is free, but he rules not. His fidelity and his bayonet,
                        turned the tide of the terrible conflict when loyal hearts were dismayed
                        with agonizing doubts, and when the <emph rend="italic">Gazette</emph> and
                        its treacherous satellites demanded the confession of treason's supremacy.
                        He has won the right to be a man; to own himself; to protect the purity of
                        his hearth; to shield his children from the auctioneer's block and a
                        master's brutality and lust. No more, no less, is his victory; and having
                        consigned him to a bondage that made him but a chattel, a thing, a stranger
                        to light and knowledge, we now condemn him because he has not defied all
                        statutes and moral and social barriers, and fitted himself for citizenship.
                        He is committed to our care for atonement--not as the prey of the fears and
                        prejudices of the ignorant, who tremble at the prospect of his progress, and
                        demand protection from his probable intellectual, social, and political
                        power. The <emph rend="italic">Gazette</emph>, and like organs and orators,
                        who dare not to be just lest the degraded bondsman shall teach them
                        humility, will be faithless still; but the enlightened, the patriotic, the
                        Christian sentiment of the Nation will in due time vindicate itself, and
                        labor to elevate an abject race, made so by our crimes--not theirs. Let the
                            <emph rend="italic">Gazette</emph> quiet its fears, let it learn to
                        accept the inevitable logic of events, for--<lb/> "The mower mows on though

                <transcript>
                    <p>We give elsewhere in to-day's paper the <emph rend="italic">Spirit's</emph>
                        report of Mr. M'Lellan's speech before the Democratic Convention, believing
                        that our readers who have been used to his speeches on the right side, may
                        feel some solicitude to know how he will advocate the other side. It reads
                        oddly enough, and but for the concluding portion of it, the reader would be
                        perplexed to make it harmonize with the accepted convictions of his new
                        associates. All will endorse his views relative to restitution to the
                        despoiled border, and the propriety of supporting the President in his
                        administration of the government. Had he stopped just there, it would have
                        required a distinct label to stamp him as a Democrat; but forgetful of the
                        wise admonition given the young judge by his father, he gives too many
                        reasons for the faith that is in him, and badly damages the symmetry of the
                        faith itself by awkward and ill-shaped props proposed in vindication of it.</p>
                    <p>Whether the South should be held in military subjection or restored to the
                        entire supremacy of civil law, is a question for defeated traitors
                        themselves to determine--not for us. If the North had the option, then Mr.
                        M'Lellan would be justly sustained in his theory that it is a question of
                        finance, and civil law should be at once restored to arrest our
                        expenditures. But it is not a question for us to decide. We wish indeed that
                        it was; but the same wicked treason that made wanton war, still practically
                        defies the supremacy of the civil authority unless it can control said
                        authority and use it to crush out every man who was not a traitor during the
                        war. Traitors are willing to accept pardon; to resume possession of their
                        lands; to vote at elections provided they can vote for blood-stained rebels,
                        and to accept offices and administer the local governments, provided they
                        can be rebels still and practically punish the faithful men of the South for
                        the crime of loyalty to the Union while treason was seeking to overthrow it.
                        If they will accept the arbitrament of the sword and the clearly defined
                        results of the war, let them vote and reign; but the government owes it to
                        all men in the subjugated States, and especially to those who were faithful
                        among the faithless, the same protection in the exercise of citizenship that
                        is due Mr. M'Lellan; and the opening efforts for the restoration of civil
                        power in Virginia have demonstrated that no such security can be attained
                        under a restoration of rebel rule. Until they will thus rule, as faithful
                        citizens and not as malicious foes, seeking covertly to crush loyalty and
                        weaken the parent government, military occupation of the South and even
                        military government are imperious necessities, and rise above all
                        considerations of a possible increase of a few millions of debt.</p>
                    <p>The gravest error of Mr. M'Lellan's whole speech is his assumption that the
                        negro cannot "be permanently elevated without placing him on a social
                        equality with the white man." This theory ignores the highest duties of the
                        citizen, and thickens the curse upon a race we have brutalized by slavery
                        because he has not defied all accepted rules of progress among whites, and
                        elevated and enlightened himself in spite of the laws interdicting his
                        education. That he is degraded is our shame, not his crime; and now that the
                        great National crime of bondage has crimsoned the fair fields of the
                        Republic in its death, and the Christian world rejoices at our National
                        disenthralment, it becomes not us to declare that the victims of our
                        brutality shall not be elevated lest they should win from us social
                        equality, and mingle their blood with the proud Anglo-Saxon. We advocate no
                        such solution of the grave problem as either social equality or
                        amalgamation. They could not be enforced even by statute, nor can they be
                        attained by the workings of any social system unless the whites shall
                        proffer their vices--not their virtues--to the victims of slavery. For such
                        men we have no fears to deter us--no hopes to make us be unjust to any. They
                        will be criminals whether surrounded by whites or blacks--the degraded of
                        any race, and no political theories will either protect them or deepen their
                        disgrace. We cast them aside in measuring the duty we owe to a people we
                        have made strangers to light and knowledge--used to gratify our tastes and
                        lusts, and thus plunged them into abject moral and social darkness. We owe
                        them elevation now--not curses for the hard destiny we have wrongfully
                        imposed upon them, and no one can be more sensible of this truth than Mr.
                        M'Lellan. There are those who might tremble at the elevation of the
                        negro--some whom a discriminating Creator has but poorly endowed, and who
                        might justly fear that the negro would outstrip them in the race for social
                        distinction and business success; but we trust that Mr. M'Lellan does not
                        confess to that standard for himself. If he does not, then is his argument
                        unworthy of his sense of justice and confronting a manifest duty to a race
                        long doomed to ignorance and by our wrongs. The time has come for atonement
                        to the slave--not by high-sounding theories of social equality, but by
                        patient, just, generous effort to make them useful to themselves and to
                        others, and aid in the early fulfillment of the justice of Him who "doeth
                        all things well."</p>

                <summary>In reaction to McLellan's address before the Democratic Convention, the
                    editors note that, although they agree with "his views relative to restitution
                    to the despoiled border, and the propriety of supporting the President," his
                    opinions relative to the reintegration of the southern states are reprehensible.
                    His "gravest error," however, is his "assumption" that blacks cannot "'be
                    permanently elevated'" without making them the social equal of the "white man."</summary>

                    <p>The Democratic Senatorial Conference met at Goodyear's on Thursday last, and
                        C. M. Duncan, Esq., of this place, was unanimously nominated for
                        Senator--Mr. M'Sherry having previously withdrawn. Mr. Duncan will please
                        clean up his revolvers and prepare for a new peace campaign. Judge Kimmell
                        is Chairman of the Democratic County Committee, and he will see that the
                        bottle and sponge are kept in order. Sharpe is ordered to the rear, for the
                        crime of knowing too much about some things and too little about some other
                        things, and he can amuse himself with the stragglers. M'Lellan will be
                        assigned the task of skirmishing around the enemy with occasional flags of
                        truce to take President Johnson's latitude, and with a strong guard to
                        prevent the Ethiopian from thanking him in moral and social progress.
                        Stenger will be charged with the task of proving that as himself, Duncan and
                        the other party leaders all voted against conferring the right of suffrage
                        upon our soldiers, therefore the soldiers should vote for them. He is
                        expected to demonstrate his proposition on the scriptural principle that the
                        soldiers when smitten on one cheek by himself and his associates, should
                        with becoming meekness present the other cheek also. Perhaps the machine
                        will run that way, and perhaps it may get a little tangled. As Duncan and
                        Stenger insisted, a year ago, that the soldiers didn't know enough to vote
                        independently, and therefore should not be allowed to vote at all, the
                        soldiers may still not know enough to vote for such candidates this year.
                        They might in the course of a century or two, learn to appreciate the
                        theories of such Democratic leaders; but just now a few may be wise that
                        way, but most of them otherwise!</p>
