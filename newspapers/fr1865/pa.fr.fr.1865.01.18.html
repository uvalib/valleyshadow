<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>"S. C." reports rumors of Blair's peace mission and deems the likelihood of
                    passage of the abolition amendment "very poor." He also criticizes the
                    "absurdity" of Provost Marshal Gen. Fry's decisions. Fry ruled against allowing
                    credit to districts for volunteers enlisting before the draft date. He also
                    decided to grant exemptions of only one year for those who find substitutes to
                    enlist for three years. "S. C." finds the "obnoxious" decisions unsurprising
                    since Fry is known as "no friend of the conscription law."<br>
