                <commentary>"When rebel sympathizers and their coppery grumblers are reminded of the
                    burning of Chambersburg, they invariably refer to the previous campaign of Gen.
                    Hunter in the valley as a justification for McCausland's brutality. Little by
                    little, however, the truth of history is vindicating itself, and Hunter's
                    campaign will stand the test of all rules of war relative to the burning of Gov.
                    Letcher's house and the Lexington Military Institute. It will be remembered that
                    Gen. Rhodes had burned a somewhat similar Institute at Carlisle the year before,
                    and the fact that McCausland persisted in using the Lexington Institute as a
                    fortress from which to fire on our troops fully warranted Gen. Hunter in burning
                    it to the ground. Col. Halpine (Miles O'Riley) who was an officer under Gen.
                    Hunter, gives the following account of the burning of Letcher's house and the
                    Lexington Institute in a late number of his spicy paper, The Citizen. We commend
                    it to the consideration of those who have labored industriously to find some
                    excuse for the atrocities of McCausland:"</commentary>

                    <p>In last week's REPOSITORY we gave Gen. Cameron's Philadelphia speech
                        assailing the Union Congressmen of that city and it is but just that Judge
                        Kelly should be heard in reply. It will be seen that he don't take to
                        funeral ceremonies at all gracefully, especially when he is to play the part
                        of the corpse. Judge Kelly's letter is addressed to the Union voters of the
                        Congressional district he has so ably and acceptably represented since 1860,
                        and is as follows:</p>
                    <p>A long and successful career in crime emboldens the guilty. A recent
                        illustration of this law of human nature impels me to violate my life-long
                        rule of conduct, and for once to notice a political slanderer. I do not,
                        however, address you for the purpose of repelling his innuendoes or
                        falsehoods. My life has been passed among you, and if its record, familiar
                        to you all, does not repel them, I have lived in vain. My purpose is simply
                        to pierce the mail of ill-gotten gold in which the slanderer has clothed
                        himself, and give you a glimpse at the loathsome object it protects.</p>
                    <p>The papers of Friday announce that Simon Cameron, of Dauphin county, was
                        serenaded by his friends on the preceding evening at the Girard House in
                        this city, and availed himself of the occasion to villify my colleagues and
                        myself "the Congressmen of Philadelphia," in a speech to the assemblage.</p>
                    <p>I was but a youth when I first heard the name of Simon Cameron, and it was as
                        the perpetrator of a great crime. He had been made the agent of the
                        Government to carry a large amount of money, due them, to the Winnebago
                        Indians, and had taken advantage of their ignorance and helplessness to
                        enrich himself. Those of you who had then attained to manhood, though you
                        may not, after the lapse of so many years, revive the burning indignation
                        with which you regarded the infamous swindler of the poor Indians, will
                        doubtless remember that instead of paying them the specie which the
                        Government confided to him for that purpose, he retained it, and gave them
                        the notes of the Middletown Bank, of which he was an owner. At their
                        encampment in the remote wilderness these notes were utterly worthless. The
                        Indians could not use them for any purpose there, nor carry them to
                        Middletown for redemption. But what was that to Simon Cameron! Was not their
                        loss his gain, and was he not so much the richer by every note that failed
                        to come home for redemption, though they did suffer and starve! And those of
                        you who are not old enough to remember all this, now know why this bold, bad
                        man is sometimes spoken of by your seniors as the "great Winnebago," and
                        sometimes as "Old Kickapoo."</p>
                    <p>For more than thirty years I have watched the tortuous career of this man,
                        and have never seen a reason to abandon my first impression of his
                        character. Whether acting with the Democratic, the Know Nothing, or the
                        Republican party--for he has in turn disgraced them all--he has never been
                        false to his criminal instincts. He has endeavored to turn them all to
                        profitable account. His ambition is sordid and panders to his avarice, and
                        he measures honors by the perquisities they expose to his grasp. He has no
                        confidence in the people, and is aware that they distrust him. His speech
                        Thursday evening was not characteristic of him, for he is prone to the use
                        of instruments. His habit is to point the stiletto, but to employ another
                        hand to drive it home. Though an active participant in the politics of his
                        country and the State for more than half a century, during which long period
                        he has pursued the profits of office, of jobs, of contracts, with eager and
                        ceaseless assiduity, he has never dared to permit his name to be presented
                        to the people of his country or State as a candidate for an elective office.
                        He crawls to the feet of the appointing power. He cares not who may be King,
                        so that he may "still be Vicar of Bray," and to that end he chaffers with
                        and corrupts weak and needy members of Conventions and the Legislature of
                        both parties.</p>
                    <p>I need not recite the disgraceful facts attending his several canvasses for
                        the United States Senate. Their nauseous odor lingers in your nostrils to
                        this hour. In the first he <emph rend="italic">bought</emph> the votes of
                        three Democratic members, and in the last bid twenty thousand dollars for
                        the one vote which would have elected him. Their last transaction was so
                        flagrant that the Legislature was compelled to take cognizance of it, and,
                        if justice be not lame as well as blind, the law and honor of our State will
                        yet be vindicated.</p>
                    <p>The evil report of his deeds pervades the country as a reproach to our State.
                        Yes, unhappily for Pennsylvania and her great interests, the buzzard-winged
                        fame of Simon Cameron is national. By months of abject solicitation and
                        corrupt bargaining he procured a mass of letters, certificates and <emph
                            rend="italic">recantations</emph>, that imposed upon President Lincoln
                        as the representative man of the Keystone State. That was an evil hour for
                        Pennsylvania. You all remember how he organized the Navy Agency in this
                        city, and feel the ineffable reproach he thus brought on our Navy Yard and
                        commercial and other business men. In the course of his imprudent and
                        ill-judged harangue he said: "In the olden time a member of Congress from
                        Philadelphia would have had sufficient influence to have carried his point
                        (the establishment of a Naval Station at League Island) without a dissenting
                        voice." Is that the assertion of a sober man? And did he who made it forget
                        that our Congressmen in the olden time in proposing to locate a government
                        workshop at Philadelphia, had not the terrible reputation of Simon Cameron,
                        the Fagan of the Harrisburg lobby and ex-Secretary of War to contend with,
                        and, therefore, had some change for success? My colleagues and I were less
                        happy than they in this respect.</p>
                    <p>As I have said, he begged and bargained for the influence which induced Mr.
                        Lincoln to invite him to a seat in his Cabinet. It was now fondly hoped, by
                        those who had not sounded the depths of his depravity, that, being old and
                        rich, he would take advantage of so distinguished an opportunity to prove
                        that he could be honest, and could administer a trust without turning it to
                        his own profit, or handing the fund over to his creatures, to be used on
                        joint account. How sadly these hopes were disappointed is attested by the
                        brevity of his term of office, and the circumstances under which it closed.</p>
                    <p>In less than one year from the day on which Simon Cameron was installed as
                        Secretary of War, Congress--though at that early day it had before it but
                        partial evidence of his crimes--indignantly drove him from that high office.
                        Two-thirds of the members of the Lower House were friends of the
                        Administration, and would gladly have sustained each member of it as they
                        did its distinguished head.</p>
                    <p>You can imagine how painful it must have been to them to find themselves
                        constrained by duty to proclaim the fact that the first man the head of
                        their party had been induced to appointed as the successor of John B. Floyd
                        had exhibited greater aptitude than he for his worst tricks. But it became
                        inevitable, for this old man, notwithstanding his boasted and reputed
                        millions, believes that one of his name is never rich enough until he has a
                        little more, and to save their party and the country, the friends of the
                        Administration in the House had to proclaim his infamy and denounce his
                        crimes. Nor was the vote by which they did it a meagre one. His friends and
                        those who would most gladly have averted this disgrace from our State, could
                        rally but about one-third of the House against the resolution of
                        condemnation. The vote was about two to one against him, though I, as a
                        Pennsylvanian, not willing to bear witness against the representative of our
                        State, but too well satisfied with his guilt to vote against the resolution,
                        failed to record my vote.</p>
                    <p>In this fact, gentlemen, you have the secret of "this distinguished
                        statesman's" hostility to me and my friends. Mr. Walborn, the Postmaster of
                        Philadelphia, and other of his creatures, have offered me his friendship and
                        support if I would endeavor to have that resolution expunged. My reply has
                        invariably been that to stir foul matter would produce a stench. I have
                        never in this or aught else endeavored to propitiate him or his creatures.
                        No stone may mark the spot where my poor remains may finally rest, but I
                        mean that my children shall be able to vindicate my name by pointing to the
                        fact that Simon Cameron and his confidential friends were ever hostile to
                        me.</p>
                    <p>With grateful regards, your, very truly.</p>

                    <p>Our "erring brethren" and "wayward sisters" of the rebel States seem to take
                        to the work of reconstruction something after the manner that the spider
                        takes to the fly. They are willing to take the oath of allegiance, to resume
                        possession of their property forfeited by their treason, to vote at
                        elections, and to be obedient to the constitution and the laws, as they
                        understand them, or rather as they would make them if they had the power.
                        Through the recent election in Norfolk thay rallied to the standard of one
                        of Lee's officers, elected him chief magistrate of the city, and smashed in
                        a few heads of those who happened to differ with them by way of showing
                        their regard for the laws and their respect for such men as had been devoted
                        to the Union from the beginning of the rebellion. The city of Norfolk was
                        thus re-constructed after the most approved style, and may now be considered
                        in the Union and a law-abiding establishment. True, any man who was not
                        heartily in sympathy with the rebels during the war is safe there only when
                        in close proximity to a few Union bayonets; but the "erring brethren" have
                        that way with them and those who have not been so fortunate as to err, must
                        accept the consequences.</p>
                    <p>Another effort at re-construction was had recently in Richmond, where a
                        clean-limbed rebel ticket was chosen from Mayor down, and the re-constructed
                        local government would have been promptly under way but for the arbitrary
                        exercise of military power, which so disregarded the rights of unrepentant
                        traitors as to squelch the whole election with its victorious champions.
                        Although all voters had taken the oath of allegiance, solemly swearing to
                        maintain the constitution and the laws of the United States, they openly,
                        defiantly, advocated and elected men, solely because of their notorious
                        hostility to the government and their presumed readiness to resist the
                        national authority in every conceivable manner that does not lead
                        straight-way to hemp and a trap-door. But the arbitrary military power of
                        the government struck out with its despotic arm and suppressed the
                        perspiring voters and their full-fledged traitors who had boasted of their
                        restoration to civil power, whereupon the whole army of coppery sore-heads
                        of the North mourn the cruel fate of their sympathizing brethren of
                        Richmond, and vigorously denounce the Administration for not allowing
                        blood-stained traitors to re-inaugurate lawlessness and chaos in the already
                        desolated Old Dominion. It is sad, indeed, that the shadows of Libby with
                        its chilly, dreary dungeons, and Belle Island, with its unnumbered graves of
                        martyred Union prisoners, must pass from the authority of the traitors; but
                        a loyal people have so decreed it, and such must be the record of history.</p>
                    <p>We know not where this system of reconstruction would end did not the
                        administration demand some test of fidelity to the Union on the part of
                        those who may be chosen to administer the laws in the subjugated States. In
                        all probability, Hangman Wise or thieving Billy Smith would be recalled to
                        the gubernatorial chair. Gen. Lee and Gen. Early, the hero who ordered the
                        burning of Chambersburg, would doubtless be chosen United States Senators.
                        The guerilla Mosby with Capt. Dick Turner, the famous keeper of Libby, and
                        others of like heroism would be elected to the popular branch of Congress,
                        and the lesser lights of treason could fill in as members of the
                        Legislature, local Judges, Justices of the Peace, &amp;c. Such a
                        re-constructed government in the Old Dominion would have the merit of
                        harmony in all its departments, and it would be uniform and consistent in
                        its great aim to overthrow the Republic and make Virginia uninhabitable for
                        Union men. This farce must stop sometime, and we think that the sooner the
                        better. It is time that traitors should be made to understand that loyalty
                        is one essential qualification for every State of the Union for any official
                        trust, and if they will not learn it one way, they must learn it another. If
                        they will elect only blood-stained, defiant rebels to important civil
                        positions, they will hasten a solution of the great problem of
                        reconstruction by subjecting the rebellious States to absolute military rule
                        and the treatment of mere provinces of the United States.</p>

                <summary>Reports that no civil cases were tried last week and that the "criminal
                    cases were mostly unimportant." There were two cases of note, however. In the
                    first, Com. vs. Snyder, an indictment for "rape on oath of Sarah Myers," the
                    jury convicted the defendant of adultery. A motion for new trial was made and
                    held over until Sept. 13th. In the second, Dr. Kell, of Orrstown, was denied his
                    motion for a new trial.</summary>
