                    grave political blunder."<br>(Names in announcement:  C. M. Duncan,  William McLellan,  Samuel Boyd,  Cap Doebler,  William Stenger)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We give elsewhere in to-day's paper the proceedings of the Democratic County
                        Convention which met here on Monday of last week, and nominated a ticket.
                        The Chambersburg patriots bore off every nomination for offices of honor and
                        profit, and the rural districts were left to gather up the odds and ends at
                        the tale end of the ticket. The town has the nominees for Senator, Assembly,
                        Sheriff, and District Attorney--the entire oyster, and the shell goes to
                        their Democratic brethren of the county persuasion. For people who like such
                        tickets, they are, we presume, just the kind that such people like, and if
                        the Democracy is content, we shan't complain. Considering that Chambersburg,
                        where all the honors are crowded, will give from two hundred and fifty to
                        three hundred against the entire list, the compliment to the Concords,
                        Letterkennys, Quincys, &amp;c., which are to give the majorities, can be
                        fully appreciated.</p>
                    <p>The nomination of C. M. Duncan for Senator was a grave political blunder,
                        looking alike to the immediate and ultimate interests of the party, and to
                        the momentous interests of the border people in case the Democratic
                        nominations should be ratified by the people. Mr. Duncan is young,
                        inexperienced, and without claims to the position other than as a mere
                        partizan of the most ultra school. He secured his nomination solely by
                        untiring effort, and against the manifest wishes of the party; but as he had
                        the field to himself until ten days before the Convention, while Mr. Sharpe
                        made no personal exertions at any time to procure delegates, the result is
                        not surprising. In the North Ward, where both reside, a fair contest was had
                        for the delegates, and Sharpe defeated Duncan by two to one, and yet Duncan
                        is made the nominee against the overwhelming protest of his own ward and
                        immediate neighbors. There are men who would have declined a further contest
                        after such a verdict from his own immediate constituents; but Mr. Duncan is
                        of the bolder class and does not become appalled at little conventionalities
                        of that sort. Politically speaking we should not complain of the nomination
                        of Mr. Duncan, as it will chill the ardor of many of the best men in the
                        party, who feel that the wishes of the Democracy were deliberately defied by
                        the Convention.</p>
                    <p>Mr. M'Lellan was nominated for Assembly without the formality of a
                        ballot--the party taking to the new convert with the tenderest evidences of
                        affection. He made a speech accepting the nomination, in which he expressly
                        disclaimed any partizan purpose, and stated that the interests of the
                        plundered border only compelled him to accept. Whether his manifest
                        reluctance related to the company he was in, or the position for which he
                        was nominated, we are not advised; but inasmuch as he announced his purpose
                        to support President Johnson's policy, we infer that he meant to make his
                        own platform in advance within the folds of his new circle of associates.
                        Many years of intimate personal and professional association with Mr.
                        McLellan could not but make us testify to his blameless character, and his
                        unusual candor and integrity as a politician; and we are anxious to see
                        whether he will advocate the destructive measures of the Democratic party,
                        and if so, how he will undertake to do it. He may prove how far a man may
                        lean toward the wrong and yet escape it, or he may demonstrate how a fair
                        man may be mastered by the wrong and scarcely know it. We part regretfully
                        with him in our political struggles, but our paths of duty diverge and the
                        issues at stake rise above all personal considerations in the pending
                        conflict.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stenger is re-nominated for District Attorney, and, with Duncan, will be
                        the master spirit of the contest. He won his commission three years ago, in
                        defiance of the army vote which defeated him, and the constitution did not
                        then confer the right of suffrage upon our soldiers; but now there will be a
                        fair poll and a full vote, of soldiers and citizens, and his competitor is
                        one of our most gallant veterans who is morally certain to conduct the
                        prosecutions of the county, during the next three years. The rest of the
                        ticket is of little moment. The election of Cap. Doebler for Sheriff is
                        conceded on all hands and Mr. Boyd won a barren honor without a serious
                        contest. The resolutions reaffirm the Democartic State platform and demand
                        restitution for military damages.</p>
