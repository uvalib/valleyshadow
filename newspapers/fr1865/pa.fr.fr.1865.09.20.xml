                <summary>A copy of the address given by Thaddeus Stevens on Sept. 6th before the
                    citizens of Lancaster, in which the Radical Republican describes the "current
                    condition of the Rebel States" and spells out his vision for "the proper mode of
                    re-organizing the Government, and the future prospects of the Republic."</summary>

                    was "characterized by masterly ability," and cast their support for his proposed
                    reconstruction program, including his call to confiscate land in the South,
                    which he deems as "the only means of supplanting the withering blight of slavery
                    with an educated, progressive, and honored industry."</summary>

                <summary>Pointing to the situation in Virginia, where several "former" rebels have
                    been elected to office, the editors question whether the political system is
                    functioning properly. To illustrate the apparent contradiction in the current
                    policy, they note that A. H. H. Stuart, the owner of the Staunton Spectator, has
                    proclaimed in his journal that "'no man who can conscientiously take the
                    Congressional oath would be a fair exponent of the sentiments of the people,' "
                    yet he is running as a "professedly loyal repentant candidate" for Congress.</summary>

                <excerpt>"We do not complain of his pardon--indeed, we think it best that it should
                    be so for the government has certainly more important duties to perform than to
                    try such half-fledged traitors as Mr. Reed, who was too faithless to be loyal
                    and too cowardly to ve traitor with any degree of manhood."</excerpt>

                <summary>It is reported that Mengel Reed was pardoned by President Johnson, but,
                    notes the article, it was granted on the grounds that he was a "traitor" "who
                    had taken up arms against the government." As such, Reed's admission runs
                    counter to the statements made by his supporters in Bedford who claim that he
                    "had no sympathy with the rebels and was their unwilling captive."</summary>

                <summary>The editors categorically dismiss an accusation made in the Lancaster
                    Intelligencer suggesting that David McConaughy received the Republican
                    nomination for Senate only after A. K. McClure dropped out of the race once he
                    "became satisfied" that the district "could not be carried by a Republican."
                    Rather, they explain, the nomination "belonged" to Adams county (the other
                    county in the district), hence the claims made in the pages of the Intelligencer
                    "are wholly wrong."</summary>
