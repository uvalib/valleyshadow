<b>The Chief Danger</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>An article from the Petersburg Express claims that the greatest threat to
                    Virginia's people and honor comes from "apostates", whites who betray their race
                    by joining the Radical party.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Our danger now is solely from apostates -- a class more to be dreaded than
                        the negro -- because they have evinced a determination to sacrifice all
                        pride of race and devotion to principle, to an indiscriminate scramble, with
                        the negroes and aliens, for the crumbs which may fall from the table of our
                        conquerors. Our danger is that enough white men may be found, who, lured by
                        the tempting power of the spoils, are now willing to herd with the poor
                        unfortunates they once despised, and thus secure victory and supremacy to an
                        inferior race.</p>
                    <p>These are sad confessions for a Virginian to make, and yet they confront us
                        with a reality which cannot be denied. We will not say that all who enter the Radical camp are actuated by
                        unworthy motives -- but this does not alter the effect of their conduct.
                        Their motives may be good -- it may be a sincere desire for reconstruction
                        -- hatred of democracy -- but this does not neutralize the baneful tendency
                        of their course. They are wounding the mother that nourished them --
                        betraying a race with whom they hold all things in common -- herding with a
                        class for whom they must have a most loathing contempt -- and are pursuing a
                        policy which, if triumphant, consigns their State to Africanization, and
                        their neighbors to civil, social, and political equality with an ignorant
                        and besotted race. Rather than witness such a result, or be participants in
                        securing such a humiliation, let the star of Virginia remain forever
                        obscured in the constellation of States. Our people have grown familiar with
                        defeat, privation, and suffering. They have been taught in the fiery
                        crucible of persecution the stern lesson that life itself is not a price too
                        dear to pay for unsullied honor. If the conquerors demand it, we can remain
                        as we are forever. When we return to the Union it must be with no blush of
                        shame, and with no tarnished record. An effulgence as pure and bright as the
                        character of Lee lends its luster to Virginia's virgin name! Accursed --
                        forever accursed -- the tongue whose whispered treason shall betray the
                        councils of her braves! COURAGE, BROTHERS! The darkness of the night is far
                        spent -- a bright day dawn awaits those who, "patient
                        through suffering," have conquered the tempter. Virginians, return. Withdraw
                        from the council fires of those who plot your mother's destruction. Rally to
                        the standard of the race whose skin you wear. Resist the sophistries of men
                        and devils who would deceive you into a still further
                        antagonism to your people. Let no one be deceived. There is but one issue in
                        the pending canvass. SHALL WHITE MEN OR NEGROES RULE VIRGINIA? -- Petersburg Express.</p>

<b>Col. Withers, Gen. Walker and Maj. Yellott</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Outlines the points made by Col. Withers, the Conservative candidate for
                    Governor, in a speech made in Staunton. Col. Withers is campaigning against the

                    universal suffrage and taxation.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Wednesday last, as per appointment of the Executive Committee of the
                        Conservative party of Virginia, Col. Robert R. Withers, nominee of the
                        Conservative party for Governor, Gen. Jas. A. Walker, nominee for Lieut.
                        Governor, and Maj. Coleman Yellott of Lexington, one of the appointed
                        canvassers, addressed the citizens of this county in the Court House. They
                        made able speeches, and were listened to for hours with great interest. We
                        have not the space to publish abstracts of their speeches which would do
                        anything like justice to them. We can only mention briefly the principal
                        subjects which were discussed in the most dignified, able, systematic and
                        logical manner by Col. Withers in his thorough analysis and clear and
                        satisfactory exposition of the hideous features of that monstrous thing
                        miscalled the Constitution. He prefaced his remarks by stating that in
                        trying to ascertain why the Convention of the Conservative party had
                        selected him as the honored standard bearer of the White man's party, he had
                        come to the conclusion that it came down to the fact that, having been a
                        physician of twenty years, practice accustomed to the dissection of defunct
                        and putrid bodies, the odor arising therefrom was less offensive to him than
                        to others, and that he was, therefore, selected to dissect that foul thing
                        miscalled the Constitution and to expose its vileness and rottenness. He
                        yielded to some in his devotion to Virginia, and maintained that she should
                        be ruled in the future, as she had been in the past, by white men.</p>
                    <p>In giving the character of the persons who composed the Convention which
                        framed the Constitution, he classified them as follows, which he said was in
                        the order of their respectability.</p>
                    <p>1st. There are conservatives -- Virginia gentlemen.</p>
                    <p>2nd. Twenty-four core field negroes.</p>
                    <p>3rd. "Carpet-baggers", a set of lean, lank, hungry
                        looking cormorants who, leaving their country for their country's good,
                        flocked in numbers to destroy, like the locusts of Egypt, every green thing
                        in Virginia.</p>
                    <p>4th. "Scallawags", who are nominally Virginians, but who know nothing of the character of
                        true Virginians, and occupy the same position in society that the scallawag
                        cattle do in the stock market.</p>
                    <p>The handiwork of such men could not be expressed to be otherwise than wicked
                        and monstrous.</p>
                    <p>Suffrage. In the reforms and extensions of the
                        privelege of suffrage heretofore, no man ever dreamed in his wildest
                        imaginings that the privilege would be conferred upon negroes. By this
                        Constitution every negro 21 years old, or who will say that he is, or can
                        get some one else to say so, can vote, while twenty thousand of the best
                        white citizens of the State are denied the privilege. The rule it
                        establishes is: Restricted suffrage for white men,
                            unrestricted suffrage for negroes.</p>
                    <p>Registration. Whilst the system of registration
                        was professedly established to prevent fraud in elections, it was really established for the purpose of perpetrating fraud. In illustration he mentioned a
                        case where only 13 were allowed to vote when there were 116 entitled to
                        vote, even under the restrictions imposed by the military bills.</p>
                    <p>If the 116 had been Radicals, all would have been allowed to vote.</p>
                    <p>Ballot. The voting by secret ballot was adopted,
                        because it enabled the Radicals to add to the ballots if a sufficient number
                        should not be cast to ensure the success of their party. It was a sneaking,
                        mean way of voting.</p>
                    <p>Taxation. The taxes would be increased fourfold.
                        The tax for the support of free schools alone would exceed the heaviest tax
                        ever levied in Virginia to include everything.-- The greatest tax ever
                        levied in Virginia amounted to about 87 cents in the $100 value, whereas
                        this Constitution allows 100 cents in the $100 value for
                            free schools alone -- making the tax for only one object about 15
                        per cent greater than the heaviest ever laid embracing all objects. The
                        taxation under the Constitution, if adopted, will not be less than three per
                        cent of the value of the property of the State, as in West Virginia.</p>
                    <p>For the first time in the history of Government the taxes will be imposed by
                        those who will have no taxes to pay. The taxes will affect all property, and
                        will oppress the poor more grievously than the rich.</p>
                    <p>The Militia System In the militia there will be no
                        distinction of race or color or previous exhibition. The
                        whites will have negroes to the right of them, negroes to the left of them,
                        negroes in front of them, negroes in the rear of them, and a negro officer
                        waving his sword of command over their heads. Negroes in the front, white
                        trash in the rear!</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>S. H. Lemon, a colored Presiding Elder in the African Methodist Church,
                        publishes the following communication in the Charlottesville Chronicle, in which he gives good counsel to his
                        colored brethren:</p>
                    <p>Mr. EDITOR.--SIR: I beg leave to have space enough in your columns to make a
                        few brief remarks to my colored brethren, as it seems to me that a great
                        many of them are in a great excitement about political things.</p>
                    <p>One thing is, the Constitution of Virginia. I will say to my colored friends,
                        that it will be better for them to be silent upon the subject. I speak to
                        them on this subject because I love them all. They live here with their
                        white friends in the South, their wives and children are in the house of our
                            Southern white friends, and now I will say in
                        conclusion that as there are two white parties now in the country, who are
                        against each other, while one is for the Constitution, and the other is
                        against it, it will be wise in us as a colored race to give up the politics
                        of the country to the two parties of white men, and when they get right,
                        then we can see what we can do. I will say to you as Moses said unto the
                        Children of Israel when at the Red Sea, "Stand still and see the salvation
                        of God."</p>
                    <p>We are taught by words of Divine Truth that "when the righteous rule, the
                        people rejoice; but when the wicked rule the people moan." I ask you if
                        there ever was a time when there was more moaning than there is at this
                        time. I would say to my colored race:--Do all you can to keep peace at home and pray to God that peace and quiet may
                        attend all the different nations of the world. I will farther say to you
                        that I believe every Southern gentleman who owned slaves is glad that you
                        are free, and I know all they want of us is good manners and industry, true
                        to our bargains and strictly truthful; and I will give you my reason for
                        saying the above words. One reason is they are now free from your tax and
                        doctor's fee; and another is that they are free from furnishing you houses
                        at their own expense and all of this trouble is now on yourselves. And I
                        will now say to you that we are taught that "The wicked flee when no man
                        pursueth, but the righteous are as bold as lions."</p>
                    <p>Dear friends I hope you will take this counsel from Your friend,</p>
                    <p>S. H. Lemon</p>
