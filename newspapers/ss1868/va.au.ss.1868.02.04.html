<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>This new reconstruction bill proposes to set aside the President and the
                        courts and the civil governments and laws of the ten excluded Southern
                        States, and to set up over them, in the person of General Grant, an absolute
                        military dictator. Let us suppose that this scheme is carried out, and that
                        these ten outside States are placed absolutely under the will of General
                        Grant, with the army at his back; that he has carried through the work of
                        Congressional reconstruction; that these ten Southern States are again in
                        Congress -- are with radical delegations in both houses, some with a
                        sprinkling of negroes and some with all white radicals ; that these States,
                        so reconstructed, have voted for the radical candidate for the Presidency ;
                        that their votes are necessary to his election, and that their acceptance by
                        this Congress the radical candidate is declared elected by this Southern
                        negro political balance of power. ---What next? Unquestionably such a state
                        of tumult and chaos among the political elements of the North as will invite
                        the experiment of a military dictator over the whole land.</p>
                    <p>This Southern negro political balance of power in the Presidential contest is
                        clearly the present object of this revolutionary Congress. In this design
                        the radical fanatics have gone too far to recede. The game is desperate, but
                        there is no alternative; and as desperate cases require desperate remedies,
                        we may be prepared for anything from these radicals resolved upon the
                        perpetuation of their power. Where, then, lies the remedy? In the hands of
                        the people of the Northern States, to be applied in the coming Presidential
                        election. -- N. Y. Herald</p>

<b>Distress in the South</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Provides an account of devastation and misery in the South, focusing on
                    unemployed Freedmen.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Richmond Enquirer says that "the accounts of
                        the despair of the whites, and of the utter demoralization of the blacks
                        which reach us from the South, are all alike. The gloomy outlines and
                        fillings up are all the same whether sketched on the banks of the
                        Mississippi or upon those of the Santee. Everywhere the negroes are armed,
                        and refuse to work. Everywhere bands of predaceous blacks are sweeping the
                        neglected plantations of everything which can be made useful either as
                        plunder or for food. Live stock of all sorts are stolen, corncribs and
                        cotton pens are pillaged, vegetables are stolen from the garden, and the
                        bare land is left for the unhappy planter.</p>
                    <p>The negroes refuse to contract, and steal all that they can lay their hands
                        upon, while they are waiting for the "Convention" to give them "forty acres
                        of land and a mule." The traveller everywhere encounters these demoralized
                        laborers in gangs, wandering up and down the highways, and skulking through
                        the forests, seeking what they may devour. "The misery of Mexico, of
                        Ireland, and of all the rest of the most wretched sections of the earth
                        seems," says an eyewitness, "to have fallen upon the Cotton States."</p>

<b>West Virginia</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article denounces the creation of the State of West Virginia, arguing

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Excerpt from the Lynchburg Republican, claiming that the Radicals seek to
                    establish a lasting system of power, but that such an attempt is doomed to
                    failure.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Lynchburg Republican says that "one of the
                        chief aims of the mongrel gatherings which now disgrace the South under the
                        name of Con- stitutional Conventions, seems to be, that they may give to
                        their dirty work the stamp of permanent durability. Vain attempt! the stuff
                        they are now concocting cannot preserve its power for ten years to come: one
                        of two things is morally certain, either the whole nation will soon be sent
                        to Hades, by the vile efforts of a corrupt Radicalism, or else the
                        intelligence and wealth of the South will again assert their na- tural
                        supremacy. In either event, "good-bye" to the Constitution now in the
                        process of manu- facture in the model of the witches' broth in Macbeth. </p>
                    <p>It may be taken as an axiom, that the better class of a country can never be
                        long nor success- fully kept in political bondage to their inferiors. That
                        is the abnormal condition of affairs which disfranchises the Judges and the
                        Congressman, whilst it sends their boot-black and carriage-drivers as
                        delegates to frame the fundamental laws for sovereign states.</p>
                    <p>These evils are their own corrective. The very violence and outrage which the
                        Radical party has imposed upon the Southern people, in bringing about the
                        work of reconstruction, will be the sooner cause that great reaction that
                        shall wipe out all remembrance of the infamous vultures now preying upon the
                        popular liberties, save the accursed memory of their diabolical
                    plottings."</p>
