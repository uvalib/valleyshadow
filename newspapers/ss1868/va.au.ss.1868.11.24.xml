                    <p>The <emph rend="italic">Norfolk Virginian</emph>, with that vigilant and
                        earnest patriotism which characterizes that able journal, calls upon the
                        Press of the State to join it in rousing the people to a lively sense of the
                        danger by which they are menaced, and says, with truth, that the loss of the
                        Presidential election is a mere trifle to the stunning disaster of defeat
                        incurred in the fight on the Constitution. The administration of Grant will
                        be, for the most part, exterior to our daily life; but government, under the
                        instrument now pending, would deal with us in our domestic as well as public
                        relations. In evidence of which we must always bear in mind that the power
                        of <emph rend="italic">compelling</emph> attendance in mixed schools is
                        lodged in the negro majority in the General Assembly. It says "no argument
                        is necessary to show our people, at this day, that the new Constitution
                        would, if put in force, make a Pandemonium of the State.--We all understand
                        this. We have seen the bitter fruits of reconstruction in Arkansas, where
                        martial law now prevails; in Louisiana, where a negro is suing the Convent
                        of the Sacred Heart to compel admission for his daughter to the classes of
                        its Female School, and, not to multiply these illustrations, in Tennessee,
                        Brownlow has, in his own profane language, "organized hell." We can defeat
                        the infamous system of law devised in Richmond. We have the numerical power,
                        and it remains for the Executive Committee and the Press to see that our
                        people do their duty. Let us look to it that the dreadful poppy-sleep of
                        apathy does not fall upon us. Let us then, gentlemen of the Press, hoist the
                        famous motto of Nelson -- "Virginia expects every man to do his duty," and
                        beat to quarters in ample time to avoid the disaster of surprise in the
                        coming action.</p>
                    <p>In the future, as in the past, that journal will find this an earnest
                        colaborer with it in the endeavor to save Virginia from the evils consequent
                        upon the adoption of the scalawag constitution.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>On Tuesday last, in the U.S. Circuit Court in Richmond, Judge Underwood
                        presiding, was one of the most important cases ever tried in this State, the
                        result of which may affect not only the judicial acts of the able,
                        energetic, industrious, and seemingly indefatigable Judge of this Circuit,
                        but also all the official acts of ninety-nine hundreds of all the officers
                        in the State.</p>
                    <p>It will be remembered by the readers of this journal that some time since a
                        negro in Lexington -- Caesar P. Griffin -- shot a son of Judge
                        Brockenbrough, for which he was tried, convicted, and sentenced to the
                        penitentiary for the term of two years by the Circuit Court of Rockbridge
                        county -- Judge H. W. Sheffey presiding. The negro, Griffin, thus sentenced
                        for unlawful shooting of Brockenbrough, sued out a writ of <emph
                            rend="italic">habeas corpus</emph>; hoping to secure his discharge in
                        Underwood's Court on the plea that Judge Sheffey had no authority to act as
                        Judge -- claiming that he has been disqualified since the 28th of July last,
                        the date of the promulgation of the ratification of the 14th amendment of
                        the Constitution of the U.S. which declares those ineligible to office who
                        took the oath to support the Constitution of the United States and
                        afterwards participated in the rebellion.</p>
                    <p>In the trial of this case, the Commonwealth is represented by
                        Attorney-General Bowden, Mr. Neeson and Gen. Bradley T. Johnson, and the
                        prisoner by Messrs Bundy and L. H. Chandler.</p>
                    <p>On Wednesday, the Court was addressed by Mr. Bundy in behalf of the prisoner.
                        On Thursday by Attorney-General Bowden and Gen. Johnson in behalf of the
                        Commonwealth, who were replied to by Bundy in his second speech.</p>
                    <p>On Friday, Mr. Neeson submitted the closing argument in behalf of the
                        Commonwealth, but not concluding by 3 o'clock, at which time the Court
                        adjourned, he was allowed one hour on Monday morning, to which time the case
                        was continued.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>The Richmond <emph rend="italic">Whig</emph> of the 18th contained an
                        editorial article discussing whether the people of the South had the <emph
                            rend="italic">right</emph> to resist, and, if so, whether it would be
                            <emph rend="italic">expedient</emph> to do so. As there is no one in the
                        South contemplating, much less advocating, armed resistance, we do not see
                        that there is any use in discussing the question, and might ask the <emph
                            rend="italic">Whig: Cui Bono?</emph> After establishing that they have
                        the <emph rend="italic">right</emph> to resist, it maintains that it would
                        not be <emph rend="italic">expedient</emph> to do so. The article concludes
                        as follows:</p>
                    <p>"Is it worth what it would cost? We think not. We should sacrifice our all --
                        our homes, our fortunes, our lives -- and, worst of all, our women. We
                        should involve in an indiscriminate ruin, the warm and generous friends we
                        have at the North. We should gain no honor even in our fall. There is
                        nothing left of the Republic worth a sensible man's fighting for. And if
                        there were, we could not restore it. And even if the Republic were
                        re-established to-morrow in its original perfection, it could not stand a
                        month. There is not honesty enough for such a Government; -- nor confidence
                        between individuals and sections sufficient enough to uphold it. -- <emph
                            rend="italic">A personal Government is a necessity of the
                        situation.</emph> We may deplore it -- (the memory of lost freedom is too
                        fresh not to excite a tear) -- but the sin and shame of it do not rest on us
                        of the South. We have fully met the demands of honor and liberty by what we
                        have done, and are entitled to our discharge.</p>
                    <p>Our conviction is that the South has gained much in having one man of honor
                        to deal with rather than a mob of tyrants. <emph rend="italic">They</emph>
                        have no conscience, no sense of responsibility, of honor, of justice, or of
                        humanity. This is the character of all mobs, great and small. What we know
                        of General Grant induces the belief that he is a man of calmness and
                        moderation; of honorable and patriotic impulses; firm in maintaining his
                        sense of right, and free from vindicative passions. As his reputation as a
                        statesman will depend on his success in promoting the welfare of the whole
                        country, it is not an unreasonable expectation to restore the prosperity of
                        the Southern States. At any rates, this strikes us as a far better reliance
                        than the desperate expedient of resistance, with the certainty of failure,
                        and converting the whole land into a Mexico or a hell."</p>

                        Grant's election as a "modest stillness." It is their duty to judge him,
                        fairly and candidly, by his acts; not to meet him with prejudice or ill
                        feeling; and <emph rend="italic">to hope</emph> that he will administer the
                        affairs of the government satisfactorily, and not in a spirit of oppression
                        towards the South. -- This is all that ought to be expected. There is no
                        need to be fawning on the footstool of power. A manly attitude is the
                        correct and proper one. It will be appreciated by a high minded and
                        honorable man. A contrary proceeding can only excite disgust and contempt.
                        And we are happy to know, that the great body of the Conservatives, upon

                <summary>Mrs. Nancy Clayton, wife of William Clayton, died near Deerfield on
                    November 14th. She was 61 years old. "Among the large circle of her
                    acquaintances there was not one to controvert the fact of her being one of the
                    best women known in that community. Her whole life seemed to justify, nay,
                    demand the assertion that she was a friend to all; and if she had an enemy, or
                    if any one, old or young, black or white, could be found who would even speak
                    disrespectfully of her, the writer of this, though well acquainted with her
                    history, has no knowledge of it. For many years she had been an exemplary member
                    of the Presbyterian church, letting her light so shine that others seeing her
                    good works might follow. Among the many brilliant traits of her character may be
                    mentioned that of the meek Christian; the devoted wife; the untiring nurse in
                    all cases, but especially around the bed of her aged and afflicted husband who,
                    for at least six years has relied upon her kind hand almost as a child upon a
                    mother. The kind friend to the orphan, and the charitable neighbor. Her illness,
                    termed inflammation of the liver, lasted only six days, when she breathed her
                    last, calmly and sweetly relying upon that Saviour in whom she had so long
                    trusted."</summary>
