                <transcript>
                    <p>In reply to a letter written him by Mr. John T. Stuart, of Springfield,
                        Illinois, asking information as to the part in the National Democratic
                        Convention the opponents in the South to the Republicans will pursue, Mr.
                        Stuart writes the following letter:</p>
                    <p>STAUNTON, Va., May 14, 1868.</p>
                    <p>Hon. John T. Stuart--Dear Sir--your favor of the 8th instant has been
                        received, and I hasten to reply to it.</p>
                    <p>As far as I have been able to gather the sentiment of the Whigs and Democrats
                        of Virginia, in regard to the selection of a candidate for the President, it
                        is this: They have no particular partiality or prejudice for or against any
                        individual. They go for success. They will cordially support any respectable
                        Conservative who may have the strength to beat the Radicals. They know that
                        the great battle for the Constitution and the Government is to be fought in
                        the North, and they are, therefore, disposed to concede to the Northern
                        States the right of selecting the standard bearer. I think when the
                        Convention meets, the Southern delegates will say to their Northern
                        associates, "You are the best judges as to which of the candidates is
                        strongest in your section; deliberate carefully and dispassionately, make
                        your choice, and we will stand by your judgment." Mr. Pendleton is not very
                        extensively known to the people of the South but all that we do know of him
                        is favorable, and the fact that he commands so large a share of the
                        confidence of the people of his own and other Western States, who know him
                        best, speaks volumes in his favor. I may add, that, as far as I am
                        individually concerned, your <sic>indorsement</sic> of him carries great
                        weight.</p>
                    <p>I have no personal acquaintance with him, but I understand he is a son of my
                        old friend, Nathaniel Green Pendleton, with whom we served in the
                        Twenty-seventh Congress, and that fact predisposes me strongly in his favor.</p>
                    <p>What the South desires, above all things, is a release from Radical bondage,
                        and we care little under whose lead that result is accomplished. We look to
                        the end, not to the means.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Pendleton would be entirely acceptable to the people of Virginia. If, on
                        a comparison of opinions in the Convention, it should be decided that this
                        is the strongest man, we will rally to his support with enthusiasm.</p>
                    <p>I have seen it suggested in some papers that while Mr. Pendleton is strong in
                        the West and Northwest, he would be obnoxious to the Middle States,
                        Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey for example. I do not know how this
                        is, but I think the matter should be carefully weighed, so that the choice
                        should fall on the man who combines the largest and most diffused elements
                        of popularity. Mr. Pendleton's views on currency and finance will be
                        acceptable to the South.</p>
                    <p>In my judgment the most enlarged and catholic spirit ought to prevail in the
                        Convention. It is no time to stand on personal preferences. The issues are
                        too important for anything of that kind to have weight.</p>
                    <p>The Southern people will support cheerfully Pendleton, Hancock, Doolittle,
                        Hendricks, Seymour, or any other sound Conservative man, provided he has
                        what John Randolph called the "turning out faculty." I think the signs of
                        the times are all auspicious, and it would be a shame if we should lose a
                        glorious victory by miserable bickerings and squabbles in regard to men.
                        Very truly yours,</p>

                    <p>For the Spectator.</p>
                    <p>NEW HOPE, AUGUSTA CO., VA.,</p>
                    <p>May 20th, 1868.</p>
                    <p>MR. EDITOR:-- The usual quiet of our village was somewhat disturbed on Sunday
                        morning the 17th inst., by the reception of an order issued by Mr. Jordan,
                        the agent of the Freedmen's Bureau, and directed to the Rev. Mr. Engle, the
                        preacher in charge here, Mr. Batis and Mr. Fisher; requesting those
                        gentlemen to have the doors of the Methodist Church opened on Sunday
                        morning, at 10 o'clock, for preaching, by the Rev. Mr. King, and threatening
                        in case of any disturbance, the arrest and trial of the parties engaged, by
                        military authority. -- Not having the order, I am unable to give the exact
                        words, but the above is the sum and substance.</p>
                    <p>In compliance with this order, Mr. Batis early on Sunday morning, endeavored
                        to carry out its requisition; but failing to obtain the keys, the matter
                        ended, with the exception of some angry and excited remarks being indulged
                        in by the parties concerned, and here, permit me to say, that the individual
                        in whose behalf, and I presume upon whose application this order was
                        obtained, certainly did not make a very favorable impression upon the minds
                        of the community, in this his first advent into our midst. Instead of
                        hearing, that he seemed to be a meek and humble disciple of his Master,
                        whose whole soul, thoughts, and feelings were enlisted in the great and
                        glorious work in which he professes to be engaged; nearly the first thing
                        which saluted our cars was, that the Rev'd gentlemen travels his circuit
                        with a <emph rend="italic">revolver</emph> in his pocket, thus exciting, at
                        least, the suspicion that he is a fighting man -- a man of blood and
                        carnage, and the reason assigned for this unusual accompaniment of a
                        Minister of the Gospel, whose weapons were supposed to be spiritual, was to
                        protect himself in any emergency; and fearing, perhaps, that a similar <emph
                            rend="italic">oral indignity</emph> might be attempted in Augusta, which
                        was, as I understand, perpetuated upon him during his itinerary last year,
                        in the county of Rockbridge. The ball, which he fired at his assailants, on
                        that occasion, while engaged in the discharge of his ministerial duties,
                        fortunately "missed its aim," and I am informed, Mr. King carries it with
                        him, and exhibits it, as I am told he did, in families in this community,
                        not so much perhaps as evidence of his skill as a marksman, while indulging
                        in carnal weapons, as a trophy of his chivalry.</p>
                    <p>My object in this communication is not to gratify any idle curiosity, but
                        simply to ascertain the fact, "whether or not the agent of the Bureau, at
                        Staunton, is clothed with the power claimed in this order. The people of
                        Augusta have always been distinguished as law-loving and a law abiding
                        people; and the citizens of this section of the county can claim supremacy
                        in this respect, over those of New Hope and its vicinity, but believing as
                        they did, that Mr. Jordan has transcended his authority by interfering with
                        matters, not pertaining to his office, they refused compliance with his
                        orders. What redress the issuing of this order on behalf of Mr. King rather
                        singular, arises from the fact that the Rev. Mr. Phelps, the Presiding Elder
                        of the Northern Methodist Church, who had an appointment to preach here some
                        time during the past year, hearing, upon his arrival, that objection was
                        made to his occupying the Church, where the rightful owners thereof, were
                        opposed to his occupying it. Mr. Phelps, I believe, is still the Presiding
                        Elder, living in Staunton; and I have never yet heard of any attempt being
                        made by him, to call upon the strong arm of the agent of the Freedmen's
                        Bureau, to introduce him into the pulpit of the Methodist Church in that
                        place. If the agent of the Bureau by a flourish of his can open the doors of
                        the Church, at New Hope, for the admittance of Mr. King, by the same process
                        he can open the Church in Staunton; and so, of every Church in the county of
                        whatever name or denomination. All that is necessary, is for Mr. King to
                        make an appointment to preach, and objection being made, he has only to call
                        upon Mr. Jordan to aid him in the accomplishment of his designs. Can this be
                        so? Has Gen. Schofield entrusted in the hands of the agent at Staunton the
                        exercise of any such power?</p>
                    <p>I ask, and as I am seeking for information, I am in hopes the questions will
                        be answered -- Is there any law, civil or military, in the State conferring
                        upon Mr. Jordan, the power claimed in this order? If there be, let him
                        publish it; and the people of this county will yield ready obedience,
                        however repugnant such law may be their feelings. If there be, let him
                        publish it; and the people of this county will yield ready obedience,
                        however repugnant such law may be to their feelings. If, however, as I
                        believe, the Post he occupies clothes him with no such authority, then the
                        people ought to know it, and Mr. Jordan be reported to his superiors, for a
                        gross violation of the duties of his office.</p>
                    <p>I had supposed from the name of the office, "<emph rend="italic">Freedmen's
                            Bureau,</emph>", that the duties appertaining to this department were
                        more exclusively confined to the interests of the negroes; and the people
                        will surely be surprised, if, in addition, they find that the rights and
                        priveleges of the different religious denominations in our county are
                        committed into the hands of Mr. Jordan, to mould them at his will.</p>

                <summary>The paper reports on May crowning celebrations in Staunton. The students of
                    the Deaf, Dumb, and Blind Institute selected a queen and celebrated a floral
                    crowning, with Miss Lizzie Catlett receiving the honor. It was accompanied by
                    student musical performances. The students of St. Francis Female School also
                    selected and crowned a May Queen. Both Protestants and Catholics crowded the
                    church grounds for the ceremony. Prof. A. J. Turner composed the music. Miss
                    Mary Nelligan was selected queen, and surrounded by a court. She led the
                    procession into church, where she crowned a statue of the Virgin Mary. The
                    pastor explained to the congregation that "the ceremony of crowning the statue
                    was not, as some suppose, a superstitious act, but only the carrying out of a
                    simple instinct of the heart, in thus paying a tribute of respect and affection
                    for one who occupied so intimate a relation to the God-Man." Religious services
                    followed.</summary>

                    <p>The white advocates of negro suffrage are dreadfully afraid that negroes will
                        want to hold office. That is exactly what was not intended. The negro, under
                        the scallawag program, was only to vote; and to vote for the white
                        scallawag. So when any colored voter desires to go to Congress he is most
                        earnestly implored not to press his claim -- he will divide the party -- he
                        will injure the negro cause! Why will he injure the negro cause? Will
                        Radicals dare to object to his holding office?--to his admission into
                        Congress?</p>
                    <p>When a man advocates the conferring of the right of voting upon negroes, and
                        denies their capability to hold office, he stultifies himself, and shows
                        that he is a man without principle. According to our republican government,
                        the two qualifications go together. The body of men capable of <emph
                            rend="italic">voting</emph> are capable, through representatives elected
                        out of their body, of <emph rend="italic">governing</emph>. If they are not
                        fit for the one, they are not fit for the other function. The white men who
                        defend the negro's right to vote assert his capacity to govern; and when
                        they try to exclude him from office they show their own selfishness and
                        greed -- that they have pretended to be friends of the negro merely to get
                        his vote for themselves -- that they have, by false pretenses to him, sought
                        to get offices and honors they could not obtain by white votes -- and that
                        they are, in short, traitors to both white and black. The negroes will best
                        show their sagacity and honesty by probing these corrupt white allies of
                        their's, finding out their rottenness, and repudiating them as soon as
                        possible. -- <emph rend="italic">Dispatch</emph>.</p>

                <summary>Claims that "the white advocates of negro suffrage are dreadfully afraid
