<b>Eastern Lunatic Asylum</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article supports the Eastern Lunatic Asylum and extols the virtues of
                    Staunton's own Western Lunatic Asylum.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We are happy to learn that the Eastern Lunatic Asylum is again becoming what
                        it was in the day of the lamented Galt. The management of this Institution,
                        if we remember rightly, caused one or more investigations to be made by
                        committees of the last Legislature of Virginia, which terminated in the
                        removal of the entire Board of Directors by Gov. Pierpont, who requested the
                        military authorities to take charge of the Institution.</p>
                    <p>General Schofield appointed, last January, a mixed Board of military and
                        civil gentlemen; who appear, since they assumed charge, to have been
                        actuated only by a desire to do justice to the State, and not to the
                        unfortunate inmates of the Institution. They elected an entire new set of
                        officers, who, we are gratified to find, are all native Virginians; and we
                        are happy to learn that in these elections, no political or personal
                        consideration actuated the Board.</p>
                    <p>The present superintendent, Dr. A.E. Peticolas, though personally unknown,
                        save to a single member of the Board, was unanimously elected, and the
                        Institution placed under his management. The result has proven the wisdom of
                        the re-election; for a late visitor states that the neat and cleanly
                        appearance of the place reminds him of the days of Galt. The walks have been
                        again shelled--the building painted--the patients neatly dressed, and the
                        diet improved in quantity and quality. The Gas house and laundry, so long
                        abandoned, will soon be in operation; and a bowling alley and billiard room
                        will be added for the amusement of the patients. The drainage, which has
                        been neglected for many years, will be commenced as soon as the funds will
                        permit. There has been no extra appropriation for repairs; the improvements,
                        being carried on entirely by the usual annual appropriation for the support
                        of the Institution. Dr. Peticolas, we learn, has been ordered by the Board
                        of Directors to visit Staunton, and consult with Dr. Stribling upon various
                        points of management and discipline.</p>
                    <p>We sincerely hope that no political or partizan spirit, will again be brought
                        to bear against this useful Institution, to the detriment of the poor
                        unfortunates to whom the State has ever acted with  generosity.</p>
                    <p>Our own institution which has acquired an enviable reputation under the
                        management of its present faithful and efficient officers, is a striking
                        example of the advantages which result from looking to capacity and merit
                        apart from all political considerations in making appointments to
                    office.</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Editorial quoting from the Norfolk Virginian and the Richmond Enquirer.
                    Argues that Virginians should unite to defeat the Constitution in August.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Our friend Jas. Barron Hope, of the Norfolk Virginian, properly appreciates the crisis, and speaks truly,
                        energetically, and patriotically -- He says, "we stand face to face with the
                        hideous problem of Negro Supremacy. We must look
                        at it fairly and without winking. We must realize that</p>
                    <p> "Now's the day and now's the hour"<br> for us to assert our ancient renown,
                        or sink into a condition whose subject misery no fancy can depict.</p>
                    <p>Every consideration of interest, every suggestion of the instinct of
                        self-preservation, every inspiration of honor, unite in calling upon us to
                        be true to ourselves and State in this grave emergency.</p>
                    <p>Interest tells us that the new constitution would be inaugurated by an
                        expenditure equal to one-third of our State debt; and in view of this fact
                        let every man of substance in the Commonwealth ask himself where he is to get this money to pay for a
                        multitude of scallawag, carpet-bag and negro officers.</p>
                    <p>Where A. B. pays one dollar tax to the State he would pay ten, direct and
                        indirect, at the least; and this would bankrupt our people.</p>
                    <p>The most sordid man in our midst must be alive to this consideration, and,
                        unless an idiot, will resolve to vote down the constitution which would
                        impose upon him taxes too enormous to be borne.</p>
                    <p>The instinct of self-preservation alone warns us against the pending
                        constitution -- with mixed schools, negro equality in church and theatre,
                        railroad and steamboat; negro magistrates, negro police, negro
                        administrators on estates, and negro guardians for white orphans.</p>
                    <p>There can be but one of two results -- a war of races or the absolute
                        degradation of the white race. If, then, you have a white skin and a manly
                        temper turn out and vote down the infamous constitution.</p>
                    <p>But, above all other impulses, the sentiment of honor should impel the people
                        of Virginia to repudiate this abominable instrument with one voice.</p>
                    <p>Think of it, fellow-citizens! You live on soil famous for the first
                        Anglo-Saxon settlement on this continent -- the soil on which the final
                        victory of the Revolution was fought; the soil rich in the blood of
                        Stonewall Jackson and thousands of unknown heroes; the soil which gave birth
                        to the greatest men who have ever adorned the history of our race; and now,
                        oh Brothers! shall we sink below the level of our former slaves!</p>
                    <p>By the ashes of the illustrious dead and the hopes of the living, we implore
                        you to come forward and do your duty!"</p>
                    <p>Do you wish to hand your name down to undying infamy, to be despised while
                        living and disgraced after death by all true men? If not
                        -- VOTE AGAINST THE CONSTITUTION.</p>
                    <p>We commence "the last heat" of the political race, says the Enquirer, under the most encouraging circumstances.
                        A wonderful change has taken place in the temper of our people since the
                        adjournment of the Conservative Convention in Virginia. They are now full of
                        hope and spirit. Apathy and despair no longer oppress them, and they are
                        anxious for a trial of strength with that mob of negroes, renegades,
                        scallawags, and carpet-baggers who are seeking the ruin of the State.</p>
                    <p>Until the election is over and our vile opponents are routed, there is work
                        for every decent man in Virginia to perform. There is a post of honor in the
                        great army of the white man's party for every one who will do his duty --
                        there is radiant honor for all who labor to maintain the supremacy of the
                        white race -- and black disgrace and deserved infamy for all who falter, or
                        desert their posts.</p>
                    <p>The vote upon the infamous work of the incendiaries and brutal negroes, who
                        for three months polluted our State capitol, will be given after the
                        adjournment of Congress, and before that body assembles in December next.
                        The blow, therefore, which will prostrate the atrocious "Constitution" in
                        August will utterly crush and annihilate it. It will completely and forever
                        rid the people of Virginia of its loathsome presence. It will "fall amid its
                        worshippers" never to revive, for we are cheered by the most encouraging
                        indications that after the next Presidential election the Radical party will
                        have neither the courage nor the power to preserve in its designs against
                        the liberties of the white race in the Southern States. It will simply be
                        necessary for our people to do their duty and they will win a victory the
                        salutatory effects of which will be felt for centuries.</p>
                    <p>By defeating the "Constitution" we shall keep the State in its present
                        condition as "a conquered province," and thus avoid all those embarrassing
                        complications which surround the question of reconstruction in those States
                        where the Radicals have triumphed. Nothing is more certain than that by the
                        time Congress meets in December either the Supreme Court will have announced
                        its decision in the McArdle case, pronouncing the reconstruction law
                        unconstitutional, or the Democrats will have won a great national victory
                        which will sweep our enemies from power. The defeat of "the Constitution"
                        is, therefore, the greatest blessing which can befall us.</p>

                        With all earnestness, we would urge white men in every neighborhood to so

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Ten or twelve years ago Staunton was in a state of discord. Political and
                        religious dissensions had invaded the business and even the social circles.
                        There was no harmony, no co-operation. At the outbreaking of the war, the
                        people were drawn together. A new order of things was initiated. This has
                        been kept up since the war. Once a week, regularly, the ministers of the
                        various denominations meet together for brotherly discourse and the
                        advancement of beneficent measures. The congregations have followed the
                        Christian example of their pastors. Harmony is restored. Families
                        interchange visits. Business men co-operate. Every one has the good will of
                        the town and of each other at heart. The choirs of the different churches
                        meet regularly and are taught by a master of music. Hence such church music
                        as you hear in no other town in the State. Hence a friendly, healthful
                        spirit, which pervades the very atmosphere. This is the great secret of the
                        prosperity and advancement of Staunton, while other towns are languishing.
                        Let us imitate Staunton, and we will share her prosperity and her happiness.

                    husband and parent, and beloved by all who knew him. In the Fall of 1866, he
                    removed to Waco, Texas where he expected to reside, and remained there about
                    eight months. His health failing him, he returned to his relatives and friends
                    in Staunton. He had been confined to his room nearly ever since his return and
                    endured intense suffering from dyspepsia, with the most unmurmuring patience and
                    christian fortitude. He leaves a wife, one small child, and a large circle of
                    friends to mourn their loss."<br>(Names in announcement:  George M. Baker,  George A. Armentrout)</blockquote>
