<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The space we designed devoting to comments on the various recent
                        revolutionary steps taken by Congress, we surrender to make room for the
                        lengthy and interesting letter of our Washington City Correspondent. We do
                        this the more willingly as we have filled a considerable portion of our
                        space with extracts from other journals which present similar views to those
                        we would express in reference to the unconstitutional and revolutionary
                        preceedings of that unscrupulous body. If the President and the Supreme
                        Court exhibit the proper degree of firmness and determined resolution, the
                        Radical party will be overthrown and ruined at the next election; but if the
                        President and the Supreme Court shall prove deficient in the requisite
                        degree of moral courage, then the Government as a Republic will cease to
                        exist, and the very worst kind of military despotism will take its place.</p>
                    <p>Grant is a disgraced man, and his duplicity and treachery have withered the
                        laurels which wreathed his brow. Dark clouds, threatening a terrific storm
                        of revolution, darken the political sky, but we do not tremble with fear. We
                        believe that the Radicals are madly rushing upon ruin, and the very means
                        they are adopting to effect their wicked ends will be so overruled by a wise
                        Providence as to frustrate their evil purposes and to bring merited
                        punishment upon them. Retributive justice is upon their track and will, in
                        time, overtake them. They will yet writhe under the scorpion lash of popular
                        condemnation. The forbearance of an outraged people, born to an inheritance
                        of freedom, cannot always abide -- there is a point beyond which forbearance
                        ceases to be a virtue, and that point has been reached, and the people will
                        arise in the majesty of their strength and hurl from places of honor and
                        power those who have betrayed them and trampled upon their rights, and will
                        visit upon them their biting scorn and fiery indignation. The people of the
                        South should be true to themselves and await the result with patience.</p>

<b>Congress Rampant</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Discusses acts of Congress. Describes as unconstitutional the measure
                    passed by Congress to require that the Supreme Court have a two-thirds majority
                    to declare an act of Congress unconstitutional.<br>
</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In view of the revolutionary and outrageous proceedings of Congress, on
                        Monday, the 13th inst., the Alexandria  Gazette 
                        says that Congress mounted a high horse again and rode at a furious rate.
                        The Senate sustained Stanton, and refused to concur in his suspension from
                        the office of Secretary of War. The House passed a bill for the
                        "reconstruction" of the Supreme Court to suit the present schemes of the
                        Radical party, requiring the assent of two-thirds of the Supreme Court in
                        order to set aside as unconstitutional a law passed by Congress. As the
                        Court now consists of eight members, being thus fixed by Radical
                        legislation, a vote of six out of the eight will be requisite to make
                        two-thirds. Mr. Garfield, of Ohio, attempted to introduce a bill "to reduce
                        and improve the military establishment by the discharge of one major-general
                        -- the one who was last commisioned in that grade before
                        the 1st of January, 1868. This is a mean method of
                        attacking Gen. Hancock, without mentioning his name, as he is the major
                        general indicated. The resolution was not passed, but will be renewed on
                        Monday (yesterday.) It does really seem as if the Radical leaders were
                        determined to go to the utmost length in revolutionizing the government by
                        legislation. The New York Times, a Radical
                        journal, declares that the extremists "are reckless, if not desperate." It
                        adds that "for twelve months past they have been engaged in tying the hands
                        of the President, and stripping him of authority conferred by the
                        Constitution; and now they are about to attempt the same operation upon the
                        Supreme Court, with the view of preventing an adverse decision upon the
                        reconstruction acts." It may well be asked that, when the overthrow of such
                        a party -- a party which tramples on the Constitution because it impedes
                        their policy -- comes, as come it must -- what will be the fate of that
                        policy - what is the upshot of their plotting and legislating and usurping?
                        The clouds were never darker over the country, than they are at present. The
                        ominous mutterings of the storm are heard and heeded in the North; for the
                        South, though it hears them, is passive, helpless and without power to
                        interpose in any way whatever. If the country is to be saved the "reaction"
                        among the people of the North and West, which has commenced, must go on!</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Expresses a fear that the Radicals will provide Grant with too much power,

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Radical Leaders in Congress, says the Alexandria Gazette, are foolishly imagining that by their course of action
                        they are strengthening the legislative power
                        which is in their hands, and which they hope yet to control. They are, none
                        of them, statesmen enough to see that they are defeating their own purposes,
                        and that by gradually placing executive authority, almost without stint, in
                        the grasp of General Grant, they are fashioning a MASTER for themselves as
                        well as for others. They are on the high road to a military despotism over
                        the whole country, themselves included. One of these days, they will wake up
                        to a sense of their condition! The National Convention in France went on
                        precisely in the same way. They had at first a government carried on by
                        legislative decrees; then, by legislative committees; then, by "leaders"
                        --such as Danton and Robespierre -- then, as they saw the power departing
                        from them, they frantically grasped after it again, but their feeble hands
                        could not long hold the reins -- and it all ended in the supremacy of a
                        Military Chieftain. And the people tired, sick, and disgusted with the
                        changes and trials and sufferings, and evils of a legislative government
                        exercised by demagogues, gladly sought peace and quiet, and refuge under the
                        strong rule of one man; and exchanged a Republic for an Empire, and an
                        Assembly of Legislators for an Emperor with the powers of a Dictator -- and
                        Libery in France lay prostrate under the heel of Napoleon. We have no
                        Napoleon -- but we may have a much weaker man, in every respect, for a
                        master!</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Radicals, says the Enquirer, hope to escape
                        their own doom by precipitating ours; and hence the result which they had
                        intended to consummate under color of pretended conventions and elections
                        and the like, they now propose to decree at a word. The prospect is, that
                        they will cut short the mummery which was intended from the first only as a
                        sham and a show, and summarily put the Southern States under Congo rule, by
                        a mere resolution of Congress.</p>
                    <p>To give force to this opinion and to strengthen our own conviction, we need
                        not recite in detail the acts of the present Congress which indicate the
                        Radical attitude. Scarcely a day passes in which abundant proof is not
                        afforded. But if any doubt remained, surely the proceedings in Washington,
                        resulting in restoring the infamous Stanton to his station as a spy in the
                        Cabinet will remove it all.</p>
                    <p>While this new attitude of the Radicals implies, as we have seen, no new
                        purpose, yet it has served to lift the veil of pretence, and reveal their
                        full designs, to the comprehension of the blindest. They discard nothing of
                        their original design but its machinery. Our people all now see that the
                        courts must save us, or the African yoke will soon be on our necks. Hence
                        the intense anxiety with which every eye is turned to Washington and the
                        eagerness with which every report is caught up which tells of the probable
                        action of the Supreme Court on some cases which have gone thither.</p>
