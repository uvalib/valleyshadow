<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Hon. A. H. H. Stuart, having been invited by a committee to join in a
                        banquet in Washington, on the 8th inst., the anniversary of the battle of
                        New Orleans, thus beautifully and appropriately replied. The letter speaks
                        for itself.</p>
                    <p>Staunton, Va. January 2, 1868.</p>
                    <p>Gentlemen:--I pray you to accept my thanks for
                        your kind invitation to attend a banquet to be given at the Metropolitan
                        Hotel, in the city of Washington, on the 8th instant, under the auspices of
                        leading members of the Conservative Democratic Party.</p>
                    <p>Under ordinary circumstances it would be peculiarly gratifying to me to
                        participate in the festivities of that occasion, and to enjoy "the feast of
                        reason and flow of soul" which, I doubt not, will give zest to your
                        entertainment. But situated as I am--disfranchised as a citizen, denied the
                        political privileges which are accorded to my negro servant; repelled from
                        the hall of the House of Representatives, to which I was elected almost by
                        acclamation; my native State, the proud old mother of Washington and Henry,
                        and Jefferson, unrecognized save as Military District No. 1--I must confess
                        I would feel somewhat out of place at your board.</p>
                    <p>In former days, when I visited Washington as representative of the people, or
                        as the associate of Webster, Crittenden and Corwin, in the executive
                        councils of the nation, I felt that, in the eye of the law at least, I was
                        the peer of the loftiest in the land. I was privileged to think freely and
                        to speak freely on all matters of public concern. Were I to join your circle
                        now, I should feel painfully conscious of the difference between your
                        position and mine. No military order can consign you to a dungeon beyond the
                        reach of habeus corpus, and no persuasive
                        bayonets admonish you to speak with "bated breath." With me the case might
                        be different. But be that as it may, while Virginia mourns I cannot rejoice.
                        While the cypress encircles her brow I cannot twine the myrtle round my own.</p>
                    <p>But may I not hope that the present condition of things is temporary? If I do
                        not misinterpret the signs of the times, the day is near at hand when, by
                        the mandate of a magnanimous people, the shackles will be stricken from the
                        limbs of Virginia and her Southern sisters, and there shall be given unto
                        them "beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, and the garment of
                        praise for the spirit of heaviness." When that glorious day shall have
                        arrived I shall be happy to meet you and your fellow patriots around the
                        festive board, and on behalf of Virginia to offer a willing and hearty
                        tribute of gratitude to the noble Conservative Democrats who set her free.</p>
                    <p>Respectfully, your ob't serv't,<br> Alexander H. H. Stuart.</p>
                <br>
