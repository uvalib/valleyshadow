                    <p>From all parts of the country we hear but one report -- the people are rising
                        in their might, determined to drive from power the horde of speculators,
                        fanatics, office-seekers, carpet-baggers, and negroes. A gentleman whose
                        position gives him the very best information, declared to the editor of the
                        Norfolk <emph rend="italic">Journal</emph> that he believed that Seymour and
                        Blair would receive fully two hundred electoral votes. There has not been,
                        since the time of Gen. Harrison, anything like the enthusiasm that now
                        exists. The people are tired out with Radical fanaticism, imposture and
                        extravagance. They had reached that point where the masses cry out "anything
                        for a change; for we can't be worse off than we are." Whenever the people
                        get to such a pitch as that good-bye to the party that is in power -- it has
                        to pack up and travel.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>It must be a source of pride and satisfaction to every citizen of Staunton
                        and Augusta County, to witness the rapidity with which the limits and the
                        business of the town are extending. In all directions new buildings are
                        going up, and old ones are being remodeled, and adapted to new uses. Our
                        mechanisms are taxed to the utmost of their ability, and are yet not able to
                        meet the demands upon them. Immigration of valuable citizens, from the North
                        and the South, and from Eastern Virginia, is flowing into our town, and the
                        demand for dwelling and business houses, cannot be supplied.-- Many of these
                        new-comers are of the most refined and polished classes, who will contribute
                        charming additions to our social circles -- others are active, intelligent,
                        energetic business men, who will add largely to our material wealth. -- It
                        is satisfactory to know, that there is nothing fictitious in this apparent
                        prosperity. It rests on a substantial basis. The agricultural interests of
                        the Valley, have been re-established on a firm foundation. At the close of
                        the war, our people, and especially our gallant young soldiers, who had won
                        so much renown, under Jackson, Jeb Stuart, and Mosby, threw aside their
                        arms, and went to work with a will. The results of this wise and patriotic
                        conduct are now visible. The ravages of the war have been repaired -- barns,
                        mills, and dwellings have been rebuilt, and the traces of rapine
                        obliterated.-- The close of the war, found us without a currency, and our
                        country stripped of those productions that bring money. But there was no
                        giving way to despondency. Males and females had, during the war, become
                        accustomed to privation. All submitted with good grace to the necessities of
                        the times. They lived frugally, and practised economy in every department.
                        In the progress of time, bountiful crops rewarded their industry. With the
                        proceeds the farmers bought labor-saving implements and machinery, to supply
                        the loss of the negro, and made wise investments in concentrated
                        fertilizers. By these means, the productions of the country have been
                        greatly augmented, and we doubt if there have ever been such bountiful crops
                        raised in the Valley, as there have been during the present year.
                        Agriculture is the true basis of the prosperity of all interior countries.
                        When the farmers flourish, all other classes share their good fortunes. Our
                        farmers are now eminently prosperous.-- Their crops of wheat, rye, oats, and
                        corn, potatoes and hay are abundant. The pastures are luxuriant, and
                        everything is in profusion except fruit. This bountiful supply of the good
                        things of life, fills the pockets of our farmers, and enables them to give
                        activity to trade and manufactures, and hence the prosperity of our town,
                        which is situated in the heart of this favored region.</p>
                    <p>Another source of the prosperity of Staunton is, in its admirable schools,
                        males and females. There is no place in the State, in which young men can be
                        more thoroughly prepared for the University, and our first class Colleges,
                        than in the Schools of Professor Powers, and the Staunton Academy.</p>
                    <p>Staunton is now the centre of female education in the South. Three of the
                        principal religious denominations, the Episcopal, Presbyterian and
                        Methodist, have large and flourishing schools here, under the management of
                        able principals, assisted by corps of highly educated professors. These
                        schools are all liberally patronized, and we hope, before long, that the
                        Baptists and Catholics, will follow the good examples which have been set
                        them, and establish first class female schools in our community.</p>
                    <p>Besides these larger Institutions we have the excellent family schools of
                        Mrs. Harman and Mrs. Hanson, which are already favorably known to the
                        public.</p>
                    <p>The location of Staunton, midway between the University and Washington
                        College, and the Va. Military Institute -- the salubrity of its climate --
                        its exemption from all malarial diseases and the high moral and religious
                        tone of its society, must strongly commend it to parents who are seeking a
                        residence, with a view to the education of their children, or who wish to
                        send their children to school.</p>
                    <p>These noble and munificent charitable institutions, the institutions, the
                        Western Asylum, and the Institution for the Deaf, Dumb, and Blind, also
                        contribute in no small degree to the prosperity of the town, not only by the
                        market which they afford, but by reason of the number of persons they
                        attract to the neighborhood.</p>
                    <p>So much for the elements of our prosperity. But all these would not avail,
                        without the enterprise, intelligence, and activity of our merchants and
                        mechanics. Agriculture produces the raw material of wealth. Manufactures
                        work them up into available shapes, and commerce distributes and converts
                        them into money. We are fortunate in having skillful, energetic, and
                        industrious artisans and sagacious, enterprising, and far-sighted merchants.
                        These classes have already increased the business of the town four-fold,
                        over what it was before the war. And there is still room for more.</p>
                    <p>So much for the sources of our prosperity. A word in regard to our wants.</p>
                    <p>We require more houses, for residences and business purposes. We ought to be
                        prepared to welcome and to accommodate all who come. The more the merrier.
                        Business begets business, and competition is the life of trade.</p>
                    <p>We want also improvements in our streets within the town and in our roads
                        leading to the town. We want more convenient means of access to the Railroad
                        Depot, to which all the heavy trade naturally tends. Now there is but a
                        single approach to it, by Augusta Street -- which is insufficient to meet
                        the demands of commerce. Let new avenues be opened to relieve this single
                        thoroughfare which is often blocked by wagons and other vehicles. The
                        opening of these new avenues, East and West of Augusta Street will render
                        accessible new suites for business houses near the R.R. These will soon be
                        improved, and the taxes on the new buildings will soon renumerate the
                        corporation for the outlay. Let our city fathers look to this.</p>
                    <p>The County Court should also make good roads to the remote parts of the
                        county. Nothing facilitates commerce and intercourse so much as good roads.
                        The Court, at its last term took an important step in this direction in
                        ordering a valuable change in the road leading to New Hope. Better grades
                        and a little work on the roads leading to Staunton will draw the trade of
                        the whole county to this central point. Instead of grades of 7 and 10
                        degrees let us have them brought down to 3. -- A little engineering skill
                        will accomplish this, at a small cost. We cannot do all at once, but we
                        should commence the system and go by degrees. Then farmers can haul twice as
                        much on the improved road as they could on the old one, and in marketing
                        their crops one trip will accomplish as much as two do now. What will the
                        County Court say -- or rather, what will they do?</p>
                    <p>There is another important want to which we invite the attention of the
                        Common Council.</p>
                    <p>Before the war the Council, to save the upper part of the town from freshets
                        and overflow widened and deepened the channel of the creek from Main Street
                        up to Mr. Garber's foundry. The recent flood demonstrated the wisdom of that
                        improvement. If it had not been made the flat part of the town would have
                        been submerged and the damage would have exceeded the whole cost of the
                        work.</p>
                    <p>But the council has not gone far enough. -- They should continue this
                        improvement from the Foundry of Parkins, Nelson &amp; Co. to some point
                        below the Gas Works. The recent flood has demonstrated the necessity of this
                        continuation of the valuable improvement above referred to. Justice to the
                        property holders in the lower part of the town demands this much. They were
                        taxed to protect the property of those above them on the creek, and it is
                        but fair that those who have been protected, should now contribute to save
                        the property of those lower down. We earnestly invite the attention of the
                        town authorities to this important and pressing necessity.</p>
                    <p>Finally, we want the Chesapeake and Ohio R. R. This is our greatest want and
                        we put it last to cap the climax.</p>
                    <p>We want the people of Augusta to give their sanction and assistance to this
                        great work which swells into national importance. We want to see the work
                        commenced and pressed with energy. We want the short line to Richmond, which
                        will bring us within 100 miles of that city. We want access to the coal,
                        iron, timber, and salt of West Va. When that is accomplished, we will have
                        scores of iron works springing up from the Blue Ridge to the Alleghany. We
                        will have cheap fuel and countless factories for the manufacture of
                        machinery, farming implements, furniture, and wool, and cotton, rising like
                        magic. We will have 100 trains per day sweeping along our Rail Road
                        diffusing wealth and prosperity in their progress. Thousands will pass
                        through our country who would, otherwise, never visit it, and when they once
                        see it who can doubt that they will be attracted to it? Then our population
                        will be increased, our lands enhanced in value, and new avenues to wealth
                        and prosperity opened. Staunton would soon have a population of 10,000 and
                        Augusta 50,000.</p>
                    <p>Let our people then, one and all, vote for the subscription to the R. R. They
                        may rest assured that the completion of that road would be worth more to the
                        country than the richest gold mine of California. The cost to them would be
                        but a trifle and would soon be refunded over and over again, in diminished
                        freights, increased facilities to market, enhanced value of lands, and the
                        general stimulus to industry.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>The Baltimore <emph rend="italic">Gazette</emph> says that the Democratic
                        party is denounced as revolutionary because, forsooth, at the recent
                        Convention at New York General Wade Hampton suggested, and the committee
                        promptly embodied in the Democratic platform, the declaration that "the
                        Reconstruction acts are revolutionary, unconstitutional and void." Does not
                        every one know that they are so? Was it not evident during the late session
                        of Congress that the Radicals themselves were alarmed lest the Judiciary
                        should decided that all the measures of Reconstruction were, as Thaddeus
                        Stevens himself admitted them to be "outside of the Constitution," and
                        therefore void and of no effect? If they had not satisfied themselves in
                        respect to the decision of the Court, why was a bill passed suddenly, taking
                        from the Court the right of jurisdiction in such cases? Why did the Court
                        itself, with that miserably weak subservience to the interests of its party
                        which has brought it to well-deserved shame, defer a decision until December
                        upon the only case that would have settled the question as to whether the
                        Reconstruction acts were constitutional or not?</p>
                    <p>Who that looks upon the present condition of the Southern States doubts that
                        all the measures of the Radicals, in respect to them, have been
                        revolutionary? What warrant is there in the Constitution for military
                        satraps? How could States which were declared to be in the Union during the
                        war, be out of the Union after the war had ended? How could the States that
                        ratified the constitutional amendment abolishing slavery be otherwise than
                        States entitled to representation in Congress? The imposition of negro
                        suffrage upon the ten States south of the Potomac, by a mere Congressional
                        edict, was also of itself a measure in the highest degree revolutionary. The
                        recognition of that right in Congress would establish the revolution as a
                        fixed fact, and would leave all States hereafter at the mercy of a
                        controlled despotism.</p>
                    <p>The leaders of the Radical faction were the very men who forced the war on
                        those whom now, even after three years of peace, they denounce and
                        disfranchise as rebels. They deliberately drew the fire of the batteries in
                        Charleston harbor; and by fraud, deceit, and treachery, they roused at the
                        North that storm of passion which cost the two sections half a million of
                        lives. They have impoverished ten Southern States, a large class of untaxed
                        bond-holders, burthened by the masses of the people with a debt equal to one
                        sixth of the entire wealth of the country and, through the agency of direct
                        and indirect taxation, they have absorbed a large portion of the wages of
                        the mechanic and the laborer.</p>
                    <p>It is the great mission of the Democratic party to restore, not to
                        revolutionize; to reconstruct, not to pull down; to reaffirm the doctrine of
                        State rights wherever those rights do not conflict with the provisions of
                        the Federal Constitution, and to build up new barriers, if need be, for the
                        protection of the people against the tyranny of those who, whilst professing
                        to be servants, arrogate to themselves the authority of masters. This cry of
                        "Stop thief," on the part of the Radicals, is a trick as old as knavery. It
                        can deceive no one who has followed, step by step, the usurpations of the
                        Radical party, and who know that its custom has been, and still is, to cloak
                        its own revolutionary designs by imputing revolutionary designs to
                    others.</p>
