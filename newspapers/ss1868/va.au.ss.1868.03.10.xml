                    <p>The Radicals will find that they have made a <sic>woful</sic> mistake in
                        their impeachment of the President. The New York Herald, in our opinion,
                        expresses the proper view when it says, as it does in its issue of the 2nd
                        inst., that if impeachment is necessary to assert the majesty of the law and
                        to guard the threatened liberties of the people from the encroachments of
                        ambitious power in the person of the President, Congress deserves well of
                        the nation for impeaching him; but if it be not necessary, if the law is not
                        in danger, if there is neither the fact of crime nor a criminal intent, and
                        if this great final appeal is made only in the interest of a partisan
                        quarrel, then to have made it and to have agitated the nation and stirred up
                        dangers of every sort against our tranquility is such a wrong that the law
                        has hardly put in the hands of the people a punishment adequate to the
                        office; for an abuse of power of impeachment is as great a crime as any that
                        impeachment was intended to punish or prevent.</p>
                    <p>Is Congress abusing this power? Is it bringing a great constitutional process
                        into contempt by appealing to it where there is no cause? Is it
                        unnecessarily disturbing the public peace? -- Is it striking at the
                        President for doing things for which the law gives him full power? Congress
                        admits and publishes to the world that it is doing all this. It reiterates
                        in every form of phrase and with all particulars the declaration of its own
                        offence. Every line of its ten articles makes a boast of its guilt before
                        the nation. -- Its ten articles of impeachment make nothing so clear as that
                        impeachment has not a sound foot to stand upon -- that it is only the insane
                        dream of men who, in indulging an intense party passion, have driven away
                        from them the guides of reason and judgment; of men who, having acquired the
                        arrogant habit in Congress of forcing their will on a feeble majority, have
                        forgotten that there is no previous question to cut off debate before the
                        people, and who therefore are now in a fair way to find out that there is
                        after all a difference between an extravagantly one sided view of the law
                        and the law itself. It matters not what happens in the Senate, for the case
                        is before the people, and they will judge it on the disproportion between
                        the offences charged and the remedy sought -- on the utter want of wisdom,
                        moderate counsel, and patriotic purpose of the republican party. If
                        impeachment go through the Senate, it will destroy the republican party
                        before the country; for the American people will not be dragged at the heels
                        of an organization governed by the failing intellect and vindictive spirit
                        of Old Thad Stevens. If impeachment fail in the Senate, it will only add to
                        the decision of the people against the representatives the weight of the
                        Senatorial judgment to the same effect.</p>

                <summary>The editors write that the impeachment of Johnson is a terrible mistake for
                    the Republican party. They argue that the party is using impeachment without
                    just cause and only as a partisan tool to impose their will. They predict that
                    the people will judge the Republicans harshly for this mistake, whether Johnson
                    is convicted or not.</summary>

                <origin/>
                <commentary/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>We expressed in our last week's issue our commendation of the speech, made in
                        the Convention on the question of negro suffrage by Mr. Jas. C. Southall,
                        the representative from the District composed of the counties of Augusta,
                        Albemarle, and Louisa. We publish the speech in full on our first page this
                        week, and hope that none of our readers wil fail to read it. We are sure
                        that they will concur in the opinion that it is an admirable speech. It is a
                        carefully prepared and finely finished production. Read it and then think of
                        what we would have gained by having Fred. S. Tukey for our representative
                        (?) in the place of Mr. Southall. <emph rend="italic">Such</emph>
                        comparisons are, indeed, odious. It is not complimentary to Southall to say
                        that he is to Tukey as Hyperion to Satyr, and, in such a comparison, we do
                        not detract from Tukey's just merits. The former has risen to a commanding
                        height, the latter has sunk to the plummet's lowest depth</p>
                    <p>While we admire Mr. Southall's speech for its eloquence and beauty, and its
                        able argument in opposition to negro suffrage, we do not endorse all the
                        sentiments expressed in it. Our kindness to the negroes prevents us from
                        rejoicing at their emancipation, for we think that emancipation, effected as
                        it was, is the greatest curse which ever befell their race.</p>

                    representative in Southall's place, and expresses disagreement with Southall for
                    his statements supporting emancipation.</summary>

                <summary>The Staunton Lyceum debated whether or not there is sufficient reason to

                    Col. Bolivar Christian in the negative. It was decided in the affirmative by a
                    vote of 9 to 3. The next topic of discussion will be whether or not banks of
                    discount help more than hurt a community. Col. George Baylor and Dr. A. M.
                    Fauntleroy will speak in the affirmative; J. B. Peyton and S. Travers Phillips
                    in the negative.</summary>

                <transcript>
                    <p>By John Quill.</p>
                    <p>Having had much experience in the science of Courting, I have determined
                        herewith to lay down some definite rules for the guidance of my 'young
                        friends.' You see I had a good many unsuccessful courts before I met my wife
                        - the females whom I loved having gone emphatically back on me. But, bless
                        you, did it harm me? No, it didn't. I was benefited thereby, and when I met
                        my wife I knew the ropes, and gathered up my affections, made one fell swoop
                        on her heart, and the door thereof banged wide open and let me in. I will
                        give you the rules and shed the sunny light of illustration upon them from
                        my own life :</p>
                    <p>1st. Never go courting the girl's parents.--You'd better edge up to the
                        charmer at once; for you can't marry her if you don't try, unless she wants
                        you, and you may be able to, even if the old folks are hard on you.</p>
                    <p>2nd. By all means get the girl's ma down on you as much as possible. If the
                        old lady is always blowing against you, the little dear begins to take your
                        part, and can't help loving you.</p>
                    <p>I did this way, and my present mother-in-law used to throw brooms and
                        washboards at me, and teach the dog to bite me in the trowsers as I climbed
                        over the fence.</p>
                    <p>3rd. If you see any others prowling about, always euchre them if you can. If
                        you see one of them buy tickets for a concert, go up and make an engagement
                        with her and get your tickets afterwards but when they visit the house
                        always act as if you were at home and they were only visitors, and never
                        leave first.</p>
                    <p>4th. If the old man has worldly wealth express a dislike to greenbacks, and a
                        hankering after love in a small house.</p>
                    <p>5th. If you are long in the parlor, you may sometimes try if your arms fit
                        well on her waist.</p>
                    <p>I tried this once, and called forth a piercing scream, which induced her big
                        pap and two brothers to chuck me down the stairs. So you be careful.</p>
                    <p>6th. When you inquire if she will have you, don't fall on your knees. It is
                        ridiculous, besides being rough on trowsers. Just take her hand and speak
                        out like a man.</p>
                    <p>I behaved similarly to this to a female, and said to her:</p>
                    <p>"Will you be mine?"</p>
                    <p>"She replied rather abruptly.</p>
                    <p>"Not much, I won't!"</p>
                    <p>It's likely that she was a little timid, but I did not care about pursuing
                        the subject any further.</p>
                    <p>7th. When you are engaged, don't go off like an old jackass and begin buying
                        teaspoons and washboilers, and candles. It is very unwise, and excites
                        comment.</p>
                    <p>8th. If a girl refuses you, don't give it up, but try again. Because two
                        negatives make one affirmative in grammar, don't consider yourself accepted
                        when a girl jilts you twice.</p>
                    <p>I asked one female forty-one times, and at last she got to expect it when I
                        came, and would sometimes holler out 'No,' from the top of the stairs,
                        before I got fairly into the house.</p>
                    <p>9th. Kiss all the children in a house, even if they are dirty, and smear
                        molasses candy in your hair. Let the boy play horse with you and make a fool
                        of you generally. This always works. It's a trump card if you play it right.</p>
                    <p>10th. And, finally, if there are two sisters and the old one is jealous, get
                        someone to choke her off, while you go in for the younger.</p>
                    <p>I did that once, and used to get a friend to ask the senior out for the
                        evening, but she found me out, and used to arrange her hairpins in the sofa
                        cushions before she went out, so that it was extremely uncomfortable.</p>
                    <p>Thus it will be seen that when courtship is alluded to, I am right there. If
                        any further information is wanted, send me a letter enclosing fifty cents,
                        and I will cheerfully give it.</p>
