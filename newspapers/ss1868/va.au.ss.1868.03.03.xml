                    <p>On our first page we insert at length one of the most remarkable publications
                        of the day. -- It is the strongly impressive address recently adopted by the
                        Democratic State Convention of West Virginia to the people. Call it rather
                        an appeal to mankind, clothed in the solemn and cogent eloquence of mournful
                        truth, calling all nations to witness the unspeakable sorrow, the
                        unaccountable folly, and the immeasurable guilt of this, our own. The man
                        who can read this without emotion must be lost to human sympathy; and if he
                        could lay it down without a resolution to right these terrible wrongs, to
                        correct these fearful errors, and to cease these multiplying abominations,
                        his conscience must be torpid, his reason perverted, and his perception of
                        truth so blinded that the spear of Ithuriel could not open his eyes. We
                        commend the address especially to adherents of the usurping party of
                        Congress.</p>
                    <p>The above, from the National Intelligencer, contains no ordinary
                        commendation. We earnestly beg our readers, says the Fredericksburg <emph
                            rend="italic">News</emph>, not to neglect to read this long article,
                        because it is long. We are on the imminent verge of the dreadfully solemn
                        and desperately earnest work of delivering ourselves and our children from
                        the domination of barbarism, by accomplishing our deliverance from the
                        detestable designs of the demagogues and devils in the shape of Radicals. We
                        verily believed the ark of civil and religious liberty for this whole
                        country was the cause of the Confederacy. We opposed the war, because we
                        thought that the time had come for us to make a new Constitution and
                        compact, as our fathers did when the old Articles of Confederation failed in
                        '87; and we vainly hoped it could be done without war. With the war and
                        since the war, it has not been done, although the Constitution of our
                        fathers is dead. A new one must be made, even if we have to wade through
                        another French Revolution to its accomplishment. If dastardly fear or
                        cowardly apathy or criminal indifference shall prevent us from defeating the
                        coming Constitution made by those vile wretches in Richmond, then we shall
                        deserve our fate, and the wrath of fate will adjudge our punishment the
                        appropriate penalty of our vile apostacy from plain principle and base
                        treason to manifest duty. -- We say then, stop sucking in moral poison from
                        Yankee publications, but seek the truth and do it, and come up to the help
                        of God and humanity in this great struggle.</p>
                    <p>Men of Virginia, awake! Arise to the height of this great argument and the
                        terrible obligation which rests on <emph rend="italic">every man</emph> to
                        do his whole duty.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>Mr. Jas C. Southall who represents in the State Convention the District
                        composed of the counties of Augusta, Albemarle, and Louisa, on Monday, the
                        24th ult., delivered an able speech in the Convention on the suffrage
                        question. The Richmond <emph rend="italic">Whig</emph> says that it was one
                        of the best, most carefully prepared and effective arguments against negro
                        suffrage delivered in that body, and that it was a manly, outspoken protest
                        of a Virginian of the highest type, who has always been moderate in his
                        views, against the abomination of negro suffrage which Congress has
                        concluded to impose upon us, with a view to the Africanization of our State.
                        His argument against negro suffrage, while conclusive and to the point, was
                        not couched in offensive language, nor was his condemnation of the Radicals,
                        while as cutting as if he had used a Toledo blade, either coarse or
                        unparliamentary. They wilted under it, but could not complain, because the
                        truth, though unpalatable, was told them in courteous language.</p>
                    <p>The illustrations of the speaker were scholarly and striking, and the same
                        may be said of the entire speech. He denounced the whites who are misleading
                        the negroes to secure office as worse than Arnold or any of the others
                        mentioned in history who took up arms against their native country. In this
                        connection he showed that there is no Republican party proper in Virginia,
                        as claimed, but only a negro party, as in the counties of Albemarle, Augusta
                        and Louisa only nineteen whites voted the radical ticket, while in the city
                        of Richmond, after a thorough canvass at the late election, even with a
                        secret ballot, they could only muster fifty white voters.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>The Richmond <emph rend="italic">Dispatch</emph> says that the fact is too
                        palpable in the South to admit of debate that the southern Radical party is
                        merely a negro party. The white overseers of plantations in the South were
                        more numerous than the white Radicals in the same South are at this time.
                        And the white Radicals are performing somewhat the same duties that were
                        discharged formerly by the white overseers. They are overseeing the freedmen
                        -- lecturing them about their duties -- telling them how they are to vote --
                        and how to discharge their obligations to their new masters, who claim their
                        allegiance and their services by reason of having set them free, as their
                        former masters did on the ground of having bought them. The new overseers
                        are required to be as vigilant and as assiduous in their supervision of
                        negroes as were their predecessors. They are afraid to leave them for a day
                        without admonition: and that admonition always relates to their proper way
                        of voting. The white Radical dreads more than anything else the probability
                        that the negro will relapse into his natural weakness of attachment for the
                        southern whites, with whom they were raised, and who always treated them
                        kindly, and in whose service they were always so much better off than they
                        are now.</p>
                    <p>* * * * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>Every Radical in any position to which he has been elected since the
                        reconstruction laws, was elected exclusively by negroes. The whites, almost
                        to a man, have voted against Radicals, and must continue to do so. It is
                        impossible that the whites that now live can forswear their alliances and
                        natural affinities and transfer their relations and communion to the black
                        race. Those who enter the arena as Radicals must become associates and
                        confidantes of the negroes if they expect to get any votes at all. This
                        every man who has been returned as Radical has done, and this all who
                        hereafter triumph must do.</p>
