                    <p>"Should now be the motto of all. We shall have more to do than vote simply on
                        the question of ratification, for the latest amendment requires that members
                        of Congress and all State officers shall be elected on this same day. This
                        cunningly devised scheme is intended to promote the interests of the negro
                        party, for it evidently anticipates that all aspirants for office, whether
                        they favor the Constitution or not, will give it their votes. This dodge
                        must force the Conservatives to run candidates, for it will not do in
                        Virginia to let the Radical candidates for the several offices be elected,
                        trusting to defeat the Constitution and thus render their election void.
                        Congress in such a case would certainly declare the Constitution ratified,
                        and the officers duly elected to their several positions. -- But if we
                        defeat the Constitution and at the same time elect to the various offices
                        Conservative men, Congress itself will be rather puzzled to frame
                        legislation to meet the case. We must, therefore, contest every point, fight
                        at every post, have candidates for every office.</p>
                    <p>Such is the advice of the Lynchburg <emph rend="italic">News</emph>, and good
                        advice it is, says the Charlottesville <emph rend="italic">Chronicle</emph>,
                        which deserves to be followed; indeed, which must be followed, with zeal and
                        energy, if we would save the State of Virginia, with her grand old
                        historical past, and her glorious future from the pollution of negro
                        domination. No lukewarmness will do now, for this is not a contest for
                        superiority between parties of our own people, as in days gone by, when
                        success to neither side involved any very great changes of State policy --
                        and there certainly could not be produced an entire revolution in the
                        government, no matter what was the issue of any given election. It will not
                        do now, for us to shut our eyes to the importance of the struggle that will
                        begin as soon as the Convention adjourns. Safety, quiet, self-respect,
                        everything is involved in the contest. It will <emph rend="italic"
                        >not</emph> do to allow Virginia to be given over to Yankees and Negroes.
                        Congress has allowed a vote, which must be a fair one, if the white people
                        take pains to guard against fraud, as they ought to do and must do. The
                        honor and prosperity of every individual depends on success and success must
                        be had. The white people hardly realize the consequences of the adoption of
                        this constitution, especially in counties where the negroes have the
                        majority. They don't seem to understand that it will carry with it high
                        taxes, negro officials in all county offices, (or, what will be worse,
                        foreign white adventurers) fraud and corruption in all places of public
                        trust. They must consider whether they are willing, without an effort, to
                        have their property assessed and the taxes collected by a stranger or a
                        negro, whether they are willing to see negroes, or their more corrupt white
                        leaders, as magistrates on the bench, as clerks, keeping the records of the
                        Courts, as Sheriffs and Constables making arrests and serving executions. If
                        they are willing to see and to suffer all of these things let them stay
                        quietly at home and take no interest in the contest -- but if not, they must
                        be up and doing. No time is to be lost. The convention must adjourn very
                        soon and the election will be ordered, in a very few weeks after its
                        adjournment. Thorough organization will do much to win the fight, and we
                        know, from the experience of the last election, that the other side will be
                        moved like a well drilled army. Is ours complete? Has everyone done the part
                        assigned him? Nor should all the work be thrown on the officers of the
                        conservative organization -- for what is the interest of each one is his
                        duty also - and all are certainly interested in this matter. Let all make up
                        their minds beforehand, and when the canvas begins, be ready to sacrifice
                        time, money, whatever may be necessary for the cause. -- With the vote on
                        the Constitution, there will also be an election of State and County
                        officers. Conservative candidates should be brought out, for all the
                        offices, even the most unimportant. The battle must be fought on every inch
                        of ground, and nothing yielded without a contest. It is possible though very
                        improbable, if the Conservatives do their duty, that the Constitution may be
                        carried. It is very probable that it will be imposed on the State by
                        Congress, without regard to the vote. Carry all, or, at any rate, most of
                        the offices in the State, and the measures of the radicals will be
                        checkmated in any event. The clause, requiring only ten day's residence,
                        opens the door to fraud, and was probably intended to do so. This only makes
                        more vigilance necessary. There should be persons at the polls, knowing all
                        voters, black and white. No exertion should be spared to control this
                        election, for if it is lost, all is lost, for some years, at least. Defeat
                        this Constitution, and time will be gained, which will be invaluable, in
                        view of the critical condition of the parties at the North.</p>

                <commentary/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>The <emph rend="italic">Enquirer</emph> says that the negroes and the New
                        England squatters at the Capitol have at last hoisted the black flag. There
                        is no longer the slightest attempt upon their part to disguise the fact that
                        the proscription and pillage of the white race are their real objects. They
                        have left to the people of Virginia no escape from a war of races but the
                        rejection of their proposed constitution. We assert this deliberately and
                        without excitement, for it requires no argument to prove that in a State
                        where the whites are united and largely preponderate in numbers over the
                        negroes they will not submit to be ruled by a degraded race and by the
                        infamous men who have fallen to the level of that race. We therefore
                        congratulate the people of Virginia that, under the influence of an
                        infuriated demagogue, who never fails to destroy the cause which he
                        espouses, the Radicals in "the Convention" have carried proscription
                        infinitely farther than the most violent revolutionists in Congress ever
                        proposed to extend it. The great danger which we apprehended was from negro
                        suffrage, with a proscription of the whites so limited and mild that our
                        people might learn to endure the political equality of the negro. But in
                        extending the right of suffrage to negro paupers and rogues, and in
                        depriving of citizenship many thousands of our best citizens, whose
                        proscription was not dreamed of by Congress, the intention of the Radicals
                        to place the negro over the white man is as clear as noon-day. Equality of
                        races is not contemplated in Virginia. Enough white men must be
                        disfranchised to secure the supremacy of those who were but yesterday our
                        slaves.</p>
                    <p>If we do not take immediate steps to prevent this attempt to degrade the
                        white race, we shall think that the white men deserve to become the "hewers
                        of wood and drawers of water" for the negro. If the recent action of the
                        "Convention" does not rally our race as one man, we shall conclude that the
                        heroism which flamed in the van of the armies of the Confederacy for four
                        years, now sleeps upon the hundred battle fields made famous by Virginia
                        valor.</p>
                    <p>Marshalled by ex-Federal volunteers and camp-followers, our late slaves are
                        seeking to deprive of political rights the brave men of Virginia who so
                        often hunted these very squatters like frightened game from our soil. The
                        offices of the State are to be filled by the soldiers of Butler, Pope,
                        Burnside, Hooker and McDowell, while our noble heroes who fought with Lee,
                        Jackson, and Stuart, are to be denied the political rights which have been
                        given to the vilest negro.</p>
                    <p>Congress never dreamed of such wholesale proscription as is contemplated by
                        "the Convention," nor has anything half so monstrous been attempted in any
                        of those Southern States where the negro has twice the power which they have
                        here. We long since assured the people of Virginia that Congress was
                        incapable of such harshness as would be attempted by this "Convention," and
                        the proof of the correctness of our opinion is now before them. As sure as
                        the sun will rise to-morrow, if they do not meet and crush this monstrous
                        conspiracy, their fate will be more wretched than that of any people the
                        tale of whose degradation and dishonor blackens the pages of history.</p>
                    <p>The rule of the soldier draws rapidly to its close in Virginia. To this we
                        have submitted, and may for years continue to submit, without dishonor, for
                        our fate in that respect has been shared by very many great nations. But
                        when the hideous Yahoo despotism, which the "Convention" is preparing to
                        inaugurate, commences, there will be such an uprising of the white men of
                        Virginia as has never been witnessed upon this continent. Our people cannot
                        be taught too early to regard this attempt to convert Virginia into a Botany
                        Bay for incendiary squatters and a Negro Hayti, as something which must be
                        resisted to the death.</p>

                    <p>If ever true, that "vigilance is the price of liberty," surely the case is
                        stronger to-day than any ever before, either in our own individual history
                        or the history of the country of which we form a part.</p>
                    <p>Congress has just passed a law of the very gravest import to Virginians, and
                        a new day awaits us. They have authorized State Conventions to provide for
                            <emph rend="italic">the election of members of Congress, as well as all
                            State officers, at the time the vote is taken upon the question of
                            ratifying the Constitution</emph>.</p>
                    <p>It is our duty to present the most unexceptionable candidates for every
                        office. For members of Congress, we should nominate the most unexceptionable
                        in each district.</p>
                    <p>For State offices, we can elect the most worthy among us, as no iron-clad
                        oath can be demanded for purely State offices. --<emph rend="italic"
                            >Fredericksburg Herald</emph>.</p>
                    <p>Whenever the Press of the State has spoken at all, says the Charlottesville
                            <emph rend="italic">Chronicle</emph>, the sentiments have been just as
                        the above. -- We <emph rend="italic">must</emph> contest every inch. This is
                        a life and death contest with the white men of Virginia, on which depends
                        the question whether they will be able to live comfortably in the State. If
                        any men doubt it, let him read the sentiments of Botts and Rives in their
                        recent speeches in Richmond, and the Franchise articles passed by the
                        so-called State Conventions. All the negroes are to be enfranchised, and
                        half the whites to be disfranchised. It is well for us that the Convention
                        cannot determine who is to vote on the Constitution, or we would have no
                        chances whatever. Judge Rives tells the Convention to let all the negroes
                        vote, who pay their taxes. -- It goes a step further, as he must have known
                        it would go, and enfranchises all over twenty-one years of age, whether they
                        pay taxes or not. Mr. Botts, with as much venom against the whites of
                        Virginia as if he were himself a negro, says "disfranchise as many as may be
                        necessary to give the Radicals the control of the State, if it takes
                        50,000." The Convention answers by framing an act that will disfranchise
                        more than 50,000. Stay at home, gentlemen, and take care of <emph
                            rend="italic">your things</emph>, if you choose, and let the negro
                        radicals get control of the State, but don't grumble afterwards, when the
                        little per cent. you make on your farms is to be taken away from you by a
                        negro tax-collector, (to be plundered by Radical officials,) at the behest
                        of a non-tax paying majority. Don't grumble, when you, without a vote, fail
                        to get justice against the <emph rend="italic">voter</emph> who steals your
                        hog, from a corrupt Radical Justice of the Peace. Now is the time to exert
                        yourselves, and it won't do for you, who belong to the class who are most
                        interested, if you fail to work <emph rend="italic">now</emph>, to come

                        right, but it is very doubtful, whether the Northern Democrats will trouble
                        themselves to help men who will not help themselves. It is, perhaps, too
                        much to ask of the patriotism of men of this day, to refuse to employ
                        mechanics, whom, they know to be working against the interests of their
                        race, but it would not cause much inconvenience, at any rate, to give notice
                        that those who continue membership in the leagues and continue their
                        exertions against the whites, will not be employed, at the expiration of the
                        current bargains. We do not ask the substitution of white for negro
                        mechanics, for we are not warring against the negroes as laborers, but as
                        rulers -- but we do think that all exertions should be made to break up the
                        negro leagues, and as a potent means to do this, notice should be given at
                        once to all Radical mechanics, white or black. They should cease to be
                        Radicals, or cease to be employed. A war is being made against property, and
                        property should defend itself. Think over these things, gentlemen, and
                        consider whether you can afford to stay at home and take care of "your
                        things," and let the country be ruined for want of a little exertion and
                        fear of a little inconvenience. A certain border lady, that we wot of, used
                        to be Union to the Unionists and rebel to the Rebels, excused herself on the
                        grounds that she had to take care of "her things." So it is now, we fear,
                        with many, they take care of present interest and do not think that they
                        sacrifice principle -- but they do, and with principle, future interests
                        also. This is no time for lukewarmness. Every man should be up and
                    stirring.</p>

                    <p>We consider ourselves "loyal." We pay our taxes, we desire the restoration of
                        the Union, we obey the laws, we defend the Constitution, and uphold the
                        public liberties: but, for all that there are those who look down upon us
                        from their superior elevation of "loyalty," and hold us to be rebels. Now
                        what constitutes a "loyal" man in their estimation? It is difficult to
                        answer, but from our knowledge of many of these patriots, we incline to the
                        opinion that first of all you must be ready to swear anything [as Stokes
                        did] which Congress may require. Did you have son, brother, father, in the
                        Confederate army, nay, for that matter, were you there yourself? If so, then
                        step up to the book, and take Heaven to witness that you had no sympathy for
                        that son, brother, or father, and wished the whole Confederate army blown
                        into atoms. Next, you must protest that you believe your life and the life
                        of every other "Union man" is in danger, and that you expect the diabolical
                        "rebels" to give the world a St. Bartholomew's day, in which the "loyal" men
                        will be "wiped out" with a bloody sponge.-- For self-preservation, you may
                        then assert your claim to the offices -- State, Federal and Municipal -- in
                        order to protect yourself from oppression, and, finally, to complete your
                        perfection, embrace Bayne with a fraternal hug, and avow eternal devotion to
                        the accomplished Hodges. Do this, and you will, then, be considered a
                        "loyal" man by the "loyalists" of Virginia. -- On the other hand, if you
                        still retain some prejudices in favor of a white man's government under the
                        Constitution, if you believe perjury to be a crime, lying to be
                        disreputable, theft to be a violation of the moral law, and rascality a fit
                        passport to jail, you must expect these intensely "loyal" fellows to
                        compliment you by the epithet "rebel," which they all forget was once borne
                        by the greatest and purest men this continent ever produced. -- <emph

                        by the State Mongrel Convention. -- At the same time, State officers, --

                        candidates for Congress will be elected. If the Constitution be ratified and
                        the candidates for State and Federal offices of the Radical party be
                        elected, then will the fate of Virginia be deplorable indeed. Her liberties
                        will be gone, and her citizens will be crushed beneath the weight of

                        of the Mongrel party, will be recreant to the trusts reposed in them,

                        this, they are doing the contrary. They seek to prevent them from forming
                        any engagements that will interfere with their political plans. -- They are
                        taught, that the first duty of the negro is, to attend political meetings,
                        listen to Radical speeches, and vote for mean white Radical candidates for
                        office, and that the duty of finding employment and providing for their
                        employment, is but a subordinate affair. If a negro, who has been registered
                        in one of our cities and is living as a pauper, can find employment and good
                        wages as a farm hand, he is urged to remain where he is, and reject the
                        proffered employment. No provision is made for him, the sufferings and
                        privations of his wife and children are unheeded, and it matters not to his
                        leaders how much they suffer, so long as he has life enough to cast his vote
                        for them. This is Radical friendship, and this kind of friendship is going
                        to pauperize the whole black population, and hasten thousands upon thousands
                        of them to the grave.</p>
                    <p>We do not remember any instance in which the Radical newspapers or speakers
                        of the State have called upon the negroes to go to work. -- All the advice
                        they get, is to array themselves against their former masters, and vote for
                        Radical men and measures. Their first and last duty, according to their
                        counsellors, is to do this.</p>

                    presentation by a company of amateur actors." The music of the orchestra alone
                    was worth admission. The paper did complain of boys "whistling and stamping"

                    <p>The <emph rend="italic">Enquirer</emph> says that as a part of organization
                        for the defeat of the "negro constitution" which will be submitted to our
                        people in a short time, we know of nothing comparable to the nomination of
                        Conservative candidates for every office in the State. Nothing serves so
                        effectually to arouse the people as an actual contest for every place, from
                        that of a governor to the most subordinate county office. We can thus reach
                        every citizen either through his sense of duty to his race, or through his
                        friendship for the candidates for office. And every candidate must make it a
                        point of honor to work, and after a most determined and energetic fashion.
                        We hope soon to hear of every man in Virginia taking the stump, who can make
                        an intelligible speech of ten minutes' length.</p>
                    <p>The attempt of the bummers, sutlers, commissioners, quartermasters, and
                        colonels, majors and captains of Butler the beast, and of Pope and Hooker
                        the braggarts, to disfranchise the gallant officers of Lee and Jackson, for
                        the purpose of distributing the offices of the State among the men who laid
                        waste our towns and cities, is thus a grand theme with which to arouse our
                        people from the mountains to the sea.-- Never was there a field for
                        indignant oratory as this attempt to give Virginia to the negroes and their
                        New England parasites affords to our public speakers. And let no
                        consideration of mercy or courtesy restrain our speakers when they are
                        denouncing this foul attempt to dishonor and degrade the land of Washington,
                        Lee, and Jackson. Let the tone and temper of the Conservative party be that
                        of a prosecutor who is dealing with men whose crimes are infamous and
                        notorious. Let the heroic officers of the grand old army of Northern
                        Virginia handle these demoralized and skulking New England squatters, who
                        have attempted to put the negro over the head of our noble Confederate
                        soldiers, as roughly as they did at Bull Run, Chancellorsville,
                        Fredericksburg, Gaine's Mill, and Coal Harbor. Let these conspirators
                        against the white race in Virginia learn that by their monstrous crimes they
                        have at last aroused a people whose courage has ever been equal to the
                        danger which threatened either their honor or their firesides. We should
                        lash the miserable vagabonds at the Capitol until they are effectually cured
                        of all desire to rear a negro empire upon the soil of Virginia.</p>
