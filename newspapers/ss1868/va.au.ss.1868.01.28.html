<b>Object of the Radicals</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Criticizes a proposal of the Radicals that would allow Southerners to take
                    loyalty oaths in exchange for certain rights.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The whole object of the Radicals North and South is to secure, by the action
                        of Congress and of Southern State Conventions, the domination of the Radical
                        party, regardless of right, justice and constitutional provisions. They will
                        adopt any device to effect their object, one of which is the device to
                        seduce white men in the South to co-operate with the negroes to enable them
                        to rule the great body of the whites, --The Southern mongrel conventions in
                        the South, says the Dispatch, are "considering a
                        proposition for this purpose -- applicants for self-degradation are invited
                        to come forward, confess to a committee, and avow their loyalty to
                        reconstruction and Radicalism, and, no matter what their past offences,
                        Congress is to be informed of their "conversion," and will at once make them
                        as good as an African and clothe them with all the dignity and immunity
                        enjoyed by that "man and brother." How many Virginians may enter upon that
                        path of enduring infamy to themselves and their posterity remains to be
                        seen!</p>
                    <p>In the mean time the people of Virginia should be hopeful and firm; trusting
                        to the ultimate triumph of justice, and right, and that predominance of the
                        superior race which can alone save the State from irretrievable ruin and
                        degradation. Let it be remembered that, no community can hope for such a
                        triumph unless they themselves preserve their honor, their virtue, and their
                        unfaltering devotion to true loyalty to their creator, their country, and
                        their fellow-men."</p>

<b>Rigid Economy</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Quotes an article from the Petersburg Index encouraging Southerners to
                    spend only on the necessities of life, and to avoid borrowing.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>If there was a time when the virtue of economy should be practised now is
                        that time. The people of the South are now in straitened circumstances,
                        pecuniarily as well as politically, and they should govern their conduct
                        accordingly. As the Petersburg Index says, "the
                        sooner our people realize their poverty, and act upon
                        it, the better. We know of those in our community whose lives seem to
                        be one long chain of monetary vexations, but daily preside at tables
                        groaning under superfluous dishes, and surrounded by families decked in the
                        most costly, extravagant, and unnecessary adornments. --These things must be
                        changed. Our people must appreciate their poverty. Hard times are upon us,
                        and we must adapt our living to the times. Luxuries should not be permitted
                        in our homes. Discard all that is unnecessary and useless. Cease to borrow
                        money. Live within your income. Buy nothing on credit. Lay aside the
                        superfluities of life. By adopting these rules, we may be enabled to weather
                        the storm that is upon us. It may be that all our efforts shall fail. If so,
                        ours will be the consolation of having done our full duty. Unless our people
                        contract their expense within the narrowest limits, their financial ruin is
                        an established fact. These are not the times for squandering and
                        extravagance. RIGID ECONOMY should be the motto of every household."</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Excerpts from a conversation with President Johnson, criticizing the New
                    Reconstruction Bill as a revolutionary measure.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> The  New York World  publishes the substance of a
                        long conversation had with the President by its Washington correspondent. We
                        have space for only a few extracts. They will show, however, that the
                        President is firm in the maintenance of his constitutional principles, and
                        determined to perform the duties imposed upon him by the constitution.</p>
                    <p>He says that a decided change has taken place in the sentiments of the
                        Northern people, and adds:</p>
                    <p>"One who held fast to a principle when a majority was arrayed against him is
                        not likely to loosen his hold upon it when so much of the pressure has been
                        removed."</p>
                    <p>He says</p>
                    <p>"The Radicals in Congress are desperate. They have made of that body a
                        political monstrosity. While they will seek to hide their deformities with
                        the cloak of patriotism, or strive to distract public attention from them by
                        specious manoeuvres, they are becoming more and more convinced that the
                        people see through it all. Having gone farther than they intended-- so far
                        that they have overleaped all bounds save those of party and ambition --
                        retreat would be equivalent to  hari kari.  They
                        keep on now, hoping to obtain by conquest in the South this year a power
                        more than equivalent to their loss of prestige in the North. Perhap they
                        trust by such a conquest to awe and subdue a majority in the north whom they
                        are failing to lead. This extreme party, which is represented by men like
                        Mr. Bingham, Mr. Boutwell, and Senator Sumner, is in a worse dilemma than
                        ever party was before in the Republic."</p>
                    <p>In reference to the action of Congress on the New Reconstruction Bill which
                        we published last week, and which the Lower House of Congress passed, on
                        Tuesday last, by a vote of 123 to 45, the President says:</p>
                    <p> " These measures are of course revolutionary. The
                        arguments used to defend them are clearly as fallacious as the assertion
                        that black is white would be. A proposition to deprive, by mere act of
                        Congress, the President of the United States of any portion of the authority
                        vested in him as Commander in-Chief of the Army and Navy is a proposal to do
                        direct violence to the Constitution." * * * * * * </p>
                    <p>" This bill assumes a right of Congress to do away with
                            the President altogether, if it chooses, and make itself executor as
                            well as legislator for the Government.  Could any assumption be
                        more arrogant, more dangerous and destructive in its tendency?" * * * *</p>
                    <p>"The attitude of the Executive has ever been one of defence or resistance. It
                        is his plain, simple office, while seeing that all laws are put in force
                        that conform to the Constitution, to see that no law obtains, so far as his
                        veto or authority can prevent it from obtaining which does not conform to
                        it.  I repeat that he is obliged by his Solemn oath to
                            defend that instrument from any and every assailment. " </p>
                    <p>In allusion to the bill which passed the Lower House of Congress two weeks
                        since, requiring a majority of two-thirds of the Supreme Court to declare
                        acts of Congress unconstitutional, he says:</p>
                    <p>"The Supreme Court is as much a separate and distinct branch of the
                        Government as Congress or the Executive. What right has Congress to usurp
                        the prerogative of the people in this case more than in the other?" * * *</p>
                    <p>"A majority of judges have always prevailed in all courts in England, France,
                        and elsewhere, as well as in the United States. This is an attempt to strip
                        the judicial branch of the Government of a right which it is competent to
                        define and maintain."</p>
                    <p>In alluding again to the New Reconstruction Bill, he says:</p>
                    <p>"As I explained at the commencement, this so-called reconstruction bill is
                        destined, if carried into effect, so as to increase and consolidate the
                        military tyranny which has already come nigh to ruin the southern states,
                        that no body of legislators not run nearly wild with a party idea could
                        think of forcing it through."</p>
                    <p>After depicting the ruin the Radical party is bringing upon the country, he
                        says:</p>
                    <p>"The measures of that party will, in my judgment, tend to repress for an
                        indefinite period such a development of the resources of the south as had
                        been accomplished before the war. It is grinding out and discouraging the
                        property-holding and intelligent class of citizens to place all power, the
                        whole conduct of affairs, in the hands of the negroes and the few native
                        whites and northern adventurers who would share it with them."</p>
                    <p>"A revolution, such as these headlong spirits seem determined to precipitate,
                            may have, if it is suffered to go on, an effect more
                            damaging than that of the last civil war."</p>
                    <p>On the correspondent's understanding that it had been understood that the
                        President had expressed his purpose to excercise all the authority vested in
                        him by the constitution to repel these revolutionary measures, he said:</p>
                    <p>"The President," said Mr. Johnson, with a resolute gesture, has already
                        expressed his intention to perform his duty. As to what that duty may
                        involve ---" (laying his hand lightly on the table and drumming his fingers
                        during the pause) "it would be rather premature, just now, even to suggest.
                            We will leave special measures for special occasions
                            when they arise. I have confidence in the good sense of the army,
                        and certainly I believe in the people. I believe in the young men; they will
                        not permit a revolution to be accomplished, even though," added the
                        President, in a serious though not at all threatening tone, "it might be necessary for the people to take the matter
                            into their own hand."</p>

<b>Resistance to Negro Rule</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Extract from the Enquirer and Examiner. Claims that it is the duty of
                    southerners to never voluntarily "submit to the rule of the negro". By obeying
                    the acts of the Convention only at the point of the bayonet, the South can
                    eventually force the North to give in.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> From a long editorial of the Enquirer and
                        Examiner, we take the following extract:</p>
                    <p>"It is the duty of the people of Virginia at once to take
                            the ground that no order, ordinance, act, law, or deed done by the
                            representatives of the secret negro leagues, whether in or out of
                            Convention, shall be obeyed, respected, or heeded, unless under the
                            compulsion of the fixed bayonets of the Federal soldiery. We must
                        in no way, by indifference or implication, let the idea effect a lodgment
                        upon the Northern mind that we will never submit to the rule of the negro.
                        This crime against civilization which the bayonet has been invoked to
                        uphold, nothing but the bayonet must enforce. Whenever that is withdrawn, it
                        is the duty of the white man at once to assert and make good at all hazards
                        the prerogatives of his race as rightfully the dominant one in the South.
                        The work of such creatures as Underwood, Hunnicutt, Lindsey, and Bayne, must
                        be swept away the very instant the soldier's inglorious duty of propping up
                        a negro power terminates.</p>
                    <p>There must be no tribute to black Caesars (or Pompeys either) which the
                        Soldier does not compel with his loaded musket at the breast of his disarmed
                        white brother of the South. Black rulers, magistrates, legislators, and tax
                        gatherers, must move with their obsequious body guards of Federal soldiers,
                        in the old Dominion. Never shall it be said that the descendants of
                        Washington, Henry, Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, and a host of other great
                        Virginians submitted to be ruled by indicted incendiaries, and black and
                        brown barbarians. The pages of history are brilliant with noble examples of
                        the patient fortitude of a defeated people, proving in the end more than a
                        match for the malignant and inhuman insults and outrages of their
                        conquerors. The bayonet ruled in Hungary for twenty years, the people of
                        that heroic nation never voluntarily surrendering a right, and at last
                        compelled a baffled tyrant to give them all which they claimed. The
                        Venetians proudly boast that, during more than half a century of Austrian
                        rule, they never compromised their honor by a single act of voluntary
                        submission to the will of the conqueror, and deliverance came to them at
                        last. And none of these oppressed nations ever had thrust upon them by their
                        conquerors a degradation half as infamous as negro rule, --the filthy,
                        polluting, barbarous supremacy of an inferior and despised race, intended by
                        God to be slaves."</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Henry Peters died near Mt. Sidney on January 6th. He was 21 years old. "The
                    deceased was a worthy young man, but had manifested no interest on the subject
                    of religion until shortly before his illness, when he resolved to become a
                    Christian. Indisposition prevented him from attending a meeting of interest in
                    the vicinity, and disease soon prostrated him upon a bed of death. Yet in his
                    illness he earnestly sought the favor of God until he obtained peace in
                    believing, and was enabled to rejoice in hope of the glory of God. He exhorted
                    his associates to attend to the interest of the soul in life and health. He
                    leaves a widowed mother and little family to mourn his sudden and early death."<br>(Names in announcement:  Henry Peters)</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Miss Lizzie C. Hopewell died of dropsy at Mt. Solon on January 14th. She
                    was 30 years old. "The subject of this notice died in the hope of a glorious
                    immortality. She had been a consistent member of the Methodist Church for
                    several years. Her life was so exemplary that when it was told her that she must
                    die she calmly said 'I am ready.' Then said to her friends, 'death is not what
                    you all think it is; I feel as though I am going on a pleasant visit.' Thus the
                    Christian, nearing the chilly waters of death, is able to say: 'All is
                    well'--'the Lord's will be done.' Her disposition was admirable, always ready to
                    forgive, ready to do any act of kindness, and obedient to parents. Truly, her
                    christian example is worthy of imitation. Thus another has been removed from the
                    embrace of loved ones on earth, to sing and shine in the realms of immortal
                    blessedness. Hence the strong basis for the blessed assurance which her friends
                    are authorized to cherish, that their loss is her eternal gain."<br>(Names in announcement:  Lizzie C. Hopewell)</blockquote>
