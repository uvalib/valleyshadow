<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>To-morrow, Wednesday, June 17th, is the day appointed for the noble and
                        gallant standard-bearers of the Conservative party of Virginia to address,
                        in this place, the citizens of Augusta county. Col. Withers, the nominee for
                        Governor, will certainly be here, and it is probable that the other
                        candidates on the State ticket will also be here, and likewise Col.
                        Marmaduke Johnson, Shelton F. Leake and Coleman Yellott, as they were
                        appointed to be here at that time. It is due to the cause, due to
                        themselves, and due to Col. Withers, who is acting so well his part of the
                        duties and labors imposed upon him, that the citizens should turn out to
                        attend the meetings appointed by the Executive Committee of the Conservative
                        party of the State. These meetings are the appointed agencies through which
                        the State of Virginia is to be saved, if at all, from Radical rule and negro
                        domination. To make these agencies efficient, the people must attend the
                        meetings.</p>
                    <p>If our citizens were actuated by no higher or better motive than the
                        enjoyment of pleasure they would be amply repaid for the time spent in
                        attending the meeting by the able, patriotic, and eloquent addresses which
                        they would hear. Col. Withers is doing noble service. He is faithfully
                        filling his appointments, and is enlightening and arousing the people.</p>
                    <p>We would say to the ladies that Col. Withers is just that style of man which
                        should inspire admiration in woman's bosom. He is noble and true, brave and
                        gallant, sans peur et sans reproche, of
                        commanding form and handsome person, and last, though not least, he is the
                        possessor of six times as many domestic jewels as the famous mother of the
                        Gracchi, ten of which are daughters.</p>
                    <p>The unanimous preference of the women of Virginia must be for Withers, for
                        there is not one of them so much of a goose as to
                        prefer the Michi-gander, his competitor for
                        gubernatorial honors.</p>
                    <p>The meeting will be held at the Court House at 11 o'clock A.M. Let the
                        attendence be punctual.</p>

<b>How the Negroes treat the Whites</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Argues that the history of Liberia and Haiti prove the "incompatability of
                    the races in the exercise of political privileges", and illustrates the danger
                    of granting blacks suffrage so soon after slavery.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Where the negroes have the political power, they not only deny the whites the
                        privilege of suffrage, but do not allow them to own land.--The Dispatch says: "In Hayti, a negro country, no white
                        man can own land. He is a disfranchised being -- a pariah who is reprobated
                        and forbidden. In the Government of Liberia, founded by the white people of
                        America, the laws are not more liberal. There no one is allowed to vote who
                        is not of African descent, and no one but a voter can
                            acquire or possess real estate in the Republic. Thus no white man
                        can vote or hold real estate in Liberia, a Republic which was, as we say,
                        established by the white people of this country, and has been the especial
                        pet of the American philanthropists. And moreover, the United States is
                        bound by treaty to protect this Liberia from the hostile neighboring African
                        tribes.</p>
                    <p>Here is something to reflect upon. This exclusion of white men from Liberia
                        was beyond question the suggested policy of the white founders of that
                        country. It grew out of the evident incompatibility of the races, and the
                        white founders desired to protect their infant colony from the troubles that
                        assuredly would follow the intrusion of a number of whites amongst them.</p>
                    <p>The same idea was instinctively impressed upon the Haytians, and they have
                        rigidly enforced it since they came into possession of the Government by
                        their murdering the white people to whom the island had belonged!</p>
                    <p>Yet what do we behold here? A denial by the United States Government of the
                        principle of incompatibility of the races in the exercise of political
                        privileges, and an attempt absolutely to place the negro in control of the
                        white race! So great an outrage on nature and common sense has not been
                        known in the history of government -- nor has there been in the history of
                        this country an act which is so disastrous to the national peace and the
                        national prosperity as this enfranchising the black man and making him a
                        voter immediately after he is taken out of a state of slavery!</p>

<b>Peace and Reaction</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>An article from the Petersburg Index, claiming that the Radicals have
                    maintained power by promising to work for peace, but that their policies have
                    created distubances throughout the South.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In an article upon this subject, the Petersburg Index says: "The Republican party has for five years endeavored, in
                        its own way, to restore to the country unity and peace. It has failed. It is
                        the sword-sustained Southern governments, the destroyed Southern labor, the
                        hybrid Southern administrations, the subordination of Southern capital to
                        irresponsible vagabonds, the entrustment of political power in the South to
                        a horde of ignorant brutes -- it is these things which have given rise to
                        all the late National troubles; for in accomplishment of these results the
                        Republican party, represented by Congress, has disregarded the Constitution,
                        depleted the Treasury, muzzled the Supreme Court, disarmed the Presidency,
                        and done all these other acts of usurpation which have made of peace, war,
                        and of hope, despair. Having brought the country to the verge of ruin, it
                        asks for an extension of power in which to complete it -- it asks for peace
                        where there is no peace, and deprecates reaction as dangerous--why? Simply
                        because in reaction is the grave of Radicalism, and the cradle of newborn
                        freedom.</p>
                    <p>The Democracy of the land has entrusted to it the duty of obtaining Peace.
                        That is the boon for which it has longed throughout these weary years, while Radicalism has been making war upon all that
                        was worth preserving of our Republican institutions. It is to obtain Peace
                        that we enter the lists, and nothing but a return to a Constitutional basis
                        will ever bring the consummation so devoutly to be wished.</p>
                    <p>It will not satisfy Democracy to secure control of the Government merely to
                        leniently execute unconstitutional Radical measures.</p>
                    <p>It will not satisfy Democracy to come into possession of and perpetuate a
                        Union pinned together by Radical bayonets.</p>
                    <p>It will not satisfy Democracy to administer Radical theories, to put a new
                        Sinbad on the Southern neck, and to win the privelege of experiencing all
                        the consequences of uncorrected Radical mistakes.</p>
                    <p>It will not satisfy Democracy to inherit negro suffrage from the dead
                        Radicals, and to control a black man's vote in that Hall in which Douglas
                        declared that this was a white man's government, formed by white men, for
                        white men and their children forever.</p>
                    <p>It will not satisfy Democracy to hold the offices of the country while the
                        South writhes under the heel of a deposed tyrant, and is ruled by a
                        radically enthroned negro oligarchy.</p>
                    <p>No! No! NO. A thousand times NO. We will gain Peace by Reaction which shall
                        remove the leprosy from the afflicted South. We must undo all that has been
                        wrongly done.-- We must go back to the very day and moment when the
                        Constitution was disregarded, and begin anew -- to build up a Union of law,
                        of love, of peace, and of permanence, with the great Charter for its corner
                        stone.</p>
                    <p>If such be not the purpose, avowed and resolute, with which Democracy shall
                        enter the field, it ought to and will be beaten, and we shall have neither
                        Reaction nor Peace.</p>

<b>Peace! Peace!!</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Claims that the proper response to the current "issue of supremacy" is not
                    a call to peace, but rather a call to active resistance and action.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Peace is a sweet word, but as Patrick Henry said on a memorable occasion,
                        some cry "Peace! Peace!! when there is no peace." As the Enquirer truthfully says, it cannot be called peace when excited
                        and embittered masses of men, divided on an issue of supremacy, an issue
                        that admits not of compromise, an issue in which one must go down -- are
                        confronted at close quarters. The whites are not to blame. They have sought
                        to avoid the contest. They take it only when made up for them, and when
                        pressed upon them.</p>
                    <p>There is "policy" in boldness now. Not mere vituperation; not the mere
                        irritation of stinging words, but the boldness which proclaims the fixed
                        purpose of the whites, the reasons which support it, and the necessity that
                        compels it. The boldness which gives full warning of the consequences of the
                        present attempt at our destruction and promises to make the warning good.
                        The boldness which does not form the gage of battle, but declares an active
                        and uncompromising resistance to the attempt upon our liberties and
                        privileges; not a passive submission, nor a timid, deprecating, supplicatory
                        opposition, half protest and half fight. Let the assailants fully understand
                        that if they are resolved on war, they shall have it to the knife. It can do
                        no harm: it may do good. If their purpose is wavering, it will dispose them
                        to peace, if it is fixed, we can but come to the inevitable trial of
                        strength.</p>

                        energetic and indefatigable Mrs. Robert Cowan is the efficient President.
                        The weather was auspicious, and great numbers were in attendence, embracing
                        old and young, male and female, Protestant and Catholic. Before the
                        ceremonies commenced, the Methodist Church, the most spacious in Staunton,
                        was found to be unable to contain more than half the number who were
                        present, and seeking admittance.</p>
                    <p>The ceremonies in the church were conducted under the auspices of Rev. John
                        L. Clarke, Pastor in charge of the M. K. Church, South, of Staunton.</p>
                    <p>He announced, at the request of the members of the "Ladies' Memorial
                        Association," that the services would be of a strictly religious character,
                        and that it was their earnest wish that no demonstrations inconsistent
                        therewith would be made, and requested the audience to refrain from
                        indulging in demonstrations of applause.</p>
                    <p>The ceremonies were commenced by the singing of the song, "Rest, soldier,
                        rest," by the 'Staunton Musical Association.'</p>
                    <p>An exceedingly appropriate Prayer was then offered by Rev. G. B. Taylor,
                        pastor of the Baptist Church, of this place.</p>
                    <p>Then the audience were again favored with music by the Musical Association.</p>
                    <p>Then the orator of the day, Rev. Frank H. Bowman, Pastor of the "Union
                        Church" (Presbyterian) of this county, delivered an address which was
                        admirably adapted to the interesting occasion.</p>
                    <p>It was marked by appropriate sentiments, correct ideas, sound principles,
                        good style and touching pathos, and was very well
                            delivered. It contained no chaffy fustian, no swelling bombast,
                        no "hifalutin" tropes, no spread-eagle metaphors, no tinseled rhetoric, no
                        mock eloquence, no "sound and fury signifying nothing." Without describing
                        the address more particularly, or attempting to furnish an abstract of it
                        (for which we have not the space) we would say that, in our humble judgment,
                        it was such in matter, style, and delivery as was appropriate to the
                        occasion, and reflected great credit upon the speaker. We consider that it
                        was worthy of the interesting occasion, and that we deem the highest praise.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of the address, the audience was again favored with
                        excellent music by the "Staunton Musical Association."</p>
                    <p>At this time a collection was taken up for the benefit of the "Ladies'
                        Memorial Association," during which Maj. Horace Lacy availed himself of the
                        opportunity to deliver a brief address, in which he paid a handsome and
                        eloquent tribute to the ladies of Fredericksburg and surrounding county for
                        the labors they have performed in honor and in fond commemoration of the
                        fallen Confederate soldiers, so many of whom offered their lives as
                        sacrifices in that portion of the State so thickly furrowed with the
                        plough-shares of war.</p>
                    <p>The collection amounted, we are sorry to say, only to the small sum of
                        $71.75.</p>
                    <p>The benediction was then pronounced by Rev. J. I. Miller, Pastor of the
                        Lutheran Church of Staunton. After which the large procession which marched
                        to the cemetery, in which were, we suppose, from 1500 to 2000 persons, was
                        formed in the following order:</p>
                    <p>1st. The "Stonewall Band," which was the band of the immortal "Stonewall
                        brigade," which accompanied, during the war, the sainted hero, christian,
                        and martyred General -- Thos. J. Jackson -- and the band composed of the
                        pupils of the Blind Institution, both under the charge of Prof. A. J.
                        Turner.</p>
                    <p>2nd. The "Augusta Fire Company," and the Fire Company of the D.D. and Blind
                        Institutions under the charge, in procession, of Col. Bolivar Christian and
                        Capt. Jas. Bumgardner.</p>
                    <p>3rd. The Sunday Schools of the town, under the charge, in like manner, of
                        Gen. Robert D. Lilley and Col. James H. Skinner.</p>
                    <p>4th. The various other schools of the place-- including the Catholic schools
                        -- under charge, in procession, of Maj. J. W. Newton and Capt. John Opie.</p>
                    <p>5th. The Ladies of the town and country under charge of Col. M. G. Harman and
                        Maj. J. M. Hanger.</p>
                    <p>6th. The citizens generally under Col. J. D. Lilley and Col. A. W. Harman.</p>
                    <p>In this order the long procession, bearing garlands and wreaths of flowers
                        and evergreens, marched with measured steps and slow to the "bivouac of the
                        dead," where so many of our loved and lamented soldiers are "encamped,"
                        sleeping that profound sleep which knows no waking, and where they will
                        silently repose till the "last trump" shall sound the rally to judgment;
                        "for the last trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised."</p>
                    <p>On arriving at the "silent city of the dead," its narrow streets were
                        thronged with numbers of the living, who, with loving hearts and tearful
                        eyes, decorated the hillock homes of the dear departed with floral mementos
                        of sincere, heartfelt affection, and evergreen tokens of undying love,
                        honor, and gratitude. The flowers placed upon the graves of the soldiers
                        will droop, the evergreens will decay, but the flowers of love which bloom
                        in the hearts of their living friends and the amaranthine wreaths of
                        affection which entwine and decorate them will never know the blighting
                        touch of decay, but will bloom perennially, imbibing and exhaling a grateful
                        fragrance.</p>
                    <p>'Tis meet that we should pay such annual tributes to the virtues and memories
                        of our dear soldiers who fell in defence of our rights and liberties though
                        alas! in vain.<br> They have no columns highly wrought, affection's tale to
                        tell.<br> Nor marble slab nor granite shaft, to teach us how they
                        fell.<br> But let this usage be observed, which we have thus begun.<br>
                        And for successive ages hence descend from sire to son.<br> And when shaft
                        and statue fall, 'twill honor do our braves.<br> When with flowers, with
                        fair youngflows, we come and strew their graves.</p>
                    <p>When the procession was returning to Staunton, the head of it was halted at
                        the gate of the cemetery, when Col. M. G. Harman said that money should be
                        raised by subscription to put the cemetery in better condition -- it
                        certainly needs it--- and also suggested that a fund should be raised to
                        support the widows and orphans of the Augusta soldiers who lost their lives
                        during the war and proposed to head each of these lists with the sum of
                        $100. He then called upon Col. J. R. Baldwin, who, as we have stated before,
                        was Chief Marshal of the procession. Cold. Baldwin approved the suggestion
                        and stated that all that was necessary to ensure the object was to enlist
                        the ladies in the enterprise, and that if Mrs. Cowan would undertake it, it
                        would succeed, for she never undertook anything which she did not make a
                        success, and never attempted what did not deserve
                        to succeed. He said he would contribute to the object proposed according to
                        his ability when the subscription list would be handed around. The
                        procession then resumed its march on its return to town. When it reached the
                        centre of Staunton it was dismissed. The celebration was, in every respect,
                        a glorious success.</p>
