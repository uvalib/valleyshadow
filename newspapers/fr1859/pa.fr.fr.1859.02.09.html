<b>A Fugitive Slave in the White House</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Story recounts Stevens' humorous quip. Stevens was heard to reply to a
                    political reporter who wondered what the Democrats would do if Buchanan returned
                    to Pennsylvania to find his political fortune there. "Mr. Stevens replied that
                    there would be no trouble about that, as the South could reclaim him any time
                    under the Fugitive Slave law!"<br>(Names in announcement:  Thaddeus Stevens,  James Buchanan)</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Evening Post's Washington Correspondent tells
                        a good saying by Thaddeus Stevens, the Republican representative elect from
                        Mr. Buchanan's District:--"A gentleman was referring, in presence of
                        Thaddeus Stevens, to the possibility of Mr. Buchanan's turning against the
                        South for the purpose of retrieving his lost fortune in Pennsylvania, and
                        asked Mr. Stevens what he thought would be the result. Mr. Stevens replied
                        that there would be no trouble about that, as the South could reclaim him
                        any time under the Fugitive Slave law! The inquirer seemed perfectly
                        satisfied."</p>

                    <p>--We unintentionally omitted to notice that fact, last week, that this long

                        W. Taylor, Esq. As popular as the "Indian Queen"
                        has ever been with the people of the County and the traveling public, its
                        reputation as a first-class House of Public Entertainment, will be more than
                        sustained under the management of its present Proprietor.--He is determined
                        to keep it a quiet, orderly and comfortable Home for the boarder or for the
                        transient visitor, and what Taylor undertakes to do, he "never surrenders"
                        until he has accomplished his purpose.</p>
