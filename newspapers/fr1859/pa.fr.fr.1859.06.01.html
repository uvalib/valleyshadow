<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>--We are puzzled. We have read a good deal in sham democratic journals
                        denouncing the agitation of the slavery question, and invoking all sorts of
                        anathemas upon the heads of those who in the Northern States dare to express
                        themselves in opposition to slavery. We cannot recollect all the epithets
                        applied to these individuals, but we remember distinctly that they are
                        called fanatics. Well, after reading so much
                        against this fanaticism in the North, it will not be surprising if we had
                        come to believe that there was one portion of this glorious land of the free
                        where fanaticism is unknown. But we have recently paid some attention to
                        matters in the South and are surprised to find that the slavery question
                        rages there fiercer than in the North. In Virginia the all prevailing
                        question in the late election was the slavery question. In Kentucky the
                        same; in Tennessee the same, and so on in all the Southern States. We also
                        find that honorable body known as the "Southern Commercial Convention" in
                        their recent meeting seemed to forget all other questions relating to the
                        commercial prosperity of the South and to confine themselves to the slavery
                        question.--Observing these things has led us to wonder if there are any
                        fanatics in the South. Will some of our Democratic friends inform us?--National Vedette.</p>
