<b>The Novel Compromise Of Swapping Rogues For Innocent Men</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A tirade against a compromise court ruling in Ohio that allowed 4 men accused of
     kidnapping fugitive slaves and 15 people accused of aiding fugitives to go free. The author
     attacks this maneuver as a corruption of state and federal rights, and the judge's action as
     "insolent defiance of God and Word."<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
     <p>The recent compromise enacted in Ohio, by which three or four men accused and arrested for
      the crime of kidnapping, and committed for trial, were suddenly let off without trial, without
      reprobation, without punishment for so great a wickedness, demands some explanation. It seems
      these guilty men, guilty of one of the highest crimes known in barbarous or civilized, in
      savage or Christian society, were swapped off in exchange for four or five innocent men,
      accused of the crime of ministering a cup of cold water, according to the command of the
      Savior of the world, to the outcast and the fugitive. The guilty men were let off as innocent,
      on condition that the innocent men might not be subjected to trial as guilty.</p>
     <p>It was a species of exchange of prisoners in this war now waging for freedom, between the
      people of the United States and the slave-power. How the innocent men themselves could have
      submitted to the exchange is a mystery; for it certainly savors of degradation and the
      baseness of a bargain, for some fifteen good Samaritans, condemned for an act of pure
      benevolence, to be put in the scales, and weighed against four men stealers, it being intended
      that neither party shall kick the beam; but, poised in air by American justice, they are
      exactly on a level, so that, provided the wretches guilty of men-stealing can be let off free
      of the gallows or of the state-prison, the Christians charged with the sin of pitying the
      stolen man, may be set at large in like manner.</p>
     <p>It seems then that the sin of aiding a poor fugitive in our country, is on a par with the
      crime of kidnapping a man; that any day a kidnapper may be secure from any punishment of his
      villainy, provided only that the Government happen to have on hand in their possession a
      prisoner of humanity to offer in exchange. And the people of Ohio seem to have come to that
      degree of humiliation, that they accept with joy and exultation, as if it were a great
      triumph, the release of fifteen innocent Christian men, charged with crime in having had
      compassion on an oppressed fellow being, on condition (as an offset for the mercy of such
      deliverance) that they let go unscathed the four apprehended men stealers! The men-stealers,
      as we understand it, were charged by the state of Ohio, with having been found, in the
      language of Gov. Chase, in the act of making war against the state, and being accused of the
      crime of kidnapping.</p>
     <p>The innocent men were accused of compassion, in attempting to protect the injured victim of
      such kidnapping, cruelty, and violence, and were in power and charge of the United States; and
      these two sovereign parties and powers propose a cartel, or exchange of prisoners; we know not
      from which side the proposition came, but so it is, or was; the exchange was proposed, and has
      been effected; a noll. pros. on the one side, entered as an
      equivalent for a noll. pros. on the other, and so the whole
      difficulty settled! We know not whether to call this a tragedy or comedy of justice; it is a
      farce, a disgrace, both to Ohio and the Federal Government, to dignify it with the name of justice.</p>
     <p>For if the fifteen men, arrested and thrown into prison for having compassion on the
      trembling fugitive, were guilty of a crime against the just and constitutional laws of this
      country, they ought not to be let off on a bribe, on a bargain, they ought to receive the
      punishment due to their crime. If the sovereign state of Ohio could not justly and
      constitutionally protect them, it ought not to consent to their being released; the people at
      the same time going into hallelujahs for this event, as if it were a great act and triumph of
      patriotism.</p>
     <p>But if these men were unjustly accused and imprisoned, if the Federal Government had seized
      them by an act of tyrany [sic], under contrivance of a slave-bill, and with pretense of
      rightful law, such law being unconstitutional and void, they being free citizens of the state
      of Ohio, and subject in this matter only to her jurisdiction, and amenable to her laws and
      courts, then it was the duty of the state of Ohio to have protected them. It is the least and
      lowest thing that any sovereign state can do for its citizens, to protect them from being
      seized by a foreign power on their own soil, hurried away from their families, thrust into
      jail, and held for trial before a tribunal that has no rightful authority over them, on an
      accusation for a crime, the very allegation of which, and the forcible proceeding in
      consequense, [sic] were unconstitutional. If a sovereign state cannot protect its citizens
      against such tyranny, such violence, what is its sovereignty worth, what is it good for? If a
      sovereign state will let its own free citizens be snatched up in this ignominious and
      oppressive way, and will tamely consent that its own judges shall refuse even the writ of
       habeas corpus for releasing the citizens, thus wrongfully
      captured, out of the grasp of such tyranny, and placing them, for trial at least, under
      protection of the state courts, we see not what prerogative of sovereignty it has left, which
      is not a mere sham, a laughing-stock.</p>
     <p>John Randolph's toast concerning State Rights may be drunk by the slaveholders over the dead
      body of such a sovereignty, with a hip and ahurrah! De mortuis nil nisi bonum. Indeed, nothing need be
      said, good or bad, concerning such dead stuff. The slave-power can afford to give such a
      state, that will thus sacrifice the personal liberty of its citizens at the bidding of an
      infamous unconstitutional federal slave-bill, the largest liberty of the yard, the fattest
      pasture, and the longest tether. A state that will bury its state rights beneath the lid of
      such a sepulcher, and then receive as a boon the release of its innocent citizens from the
      Federal prison, by itself releasing a gang of robbers and kidnappers, whom it was under sacred
      obligation to have punished, a state that will buy as a good bargain, or accept as a boon from
      tyranny, what belonged to it by freedom and justice, what it ought to have demanded and
      extorted as its simplest right, its indisputable authority and possession; a state that for
      the sake of such a bargain, such a gracious condescension of the slave-power, will agree to
      stand by, and see the violation of its own state laws with impunity; a state that will consent
      to dismiss a gang of kidnappers from its prisons unharmed, on condition that its own free
      citizens, unrighteously imprisoned, may be unbound and let off without trial; -- such a state
      may be indulged by the Federal Government, and the slave-power enthroned over it, in any of
      the most extravagant, jubilant anthems concerning the opening of the prison doors, and letting
      the oppressed go free; in any freaks and sallies of speculative demonstrations, in
      conventions, in resolutions, in speeches all blazing with the pyrotechnics and thundering with
      the detonating powder of the highest republican and democratic liberty. The grandeur such
      harmless, ineffective enthusiasm, the safer for the slave-tyranny; the more sublime the flight
      of the spread eagles of state eloquence, the more abject and spiritless will such a people be,
      whose ardor in the cause of freedom is afraid to assert the right, and bribes the wrong; whose
      zeal shuns the form and cost of brave decisive deeds, and expends itself in speculative toasts
      and hallelujahs.</p>
     <p>There being no intention, nor any danger of going beyond the form of mere speculation
      concerning liberty, it costs nothing, as Burke said of the flights of hypocrisy, to have it
      magnificent. And our slave-drivers need not be afraid, though Bunker Hill Monument itself
      should, one of these Fourth of Julys, be rammed full with powder, and the charge wadded with
      all the glittering generalities of the Declaration of Independence, and the column started and
      fired down South, with the huge hissing red-hot ball flaming from its granite throat, that all
      men are born free and equal, black or white, and that property in man is a lie, a curse, and
      an impossibility.</p>
     <p>On the other hand, if the four men (we believe there were four) imprisoned in the state of
      Ohio for the crime of kidnapping, were really guilty of that crime, they should have been
      tried, sentenced, and punished for it. Where was the authority, either in law or justice, to
      let them off? If they had not been guilty of that crime, then their
      accusers, or those who threw them into prison, ought to have been tried for slander and false
      imprisonment. If they had been guilty of that crime, being one of
      the most atrocious offenses that can be committed against society, a capital crime, denounced
      by God himself as worthy of death, and by our own laws, when committed in Africa, as piracy,
      and in even this country, as robbery and malignant violence; if they had been so guilty, then
      the state of Ohio was guilty in letting them go free.</p>
     <p>It would seem that while slaves cannot go free, criminals can. But by whose authority could the noll. pros. in behalf of these wretches be issued or entered, and the indictment
      against them dismissed? Suppose that three or four rascals were taken at midnight in our
      streets, in the act of highway robbery, and thrown into prison for trial; where is the power,
      legal, judicial, or executive, state or Federal, by which it could rightly be said, They shall
      not be brought to trial; let the prosecution be withdrawn, and let them go forth again into
      society, unscathed by the law or its penalty? Where is the man, or the body of men, the judge,
      or the personal or political friend, the president or the government, that would dare propose
      the emptying of one of the corridors of Sing Sing and the deliverance of the prisoners there,
      as a condition, a boon, a bargain, a cartel of exchange, on the ground of which those four
      highway robbers should be released and sent home to their dens, to plot new crimes with
      impunity, the public, meanwhile, mystified and astounded with such processes of justice?</p>
     <p>Again we ask, Why were not these kidnappers brought to justice? Is that the kind of State
      Sovereignty which Ohio is going to teach and exercise, the right of entering a noll. pros. in behalf of vile criminals, on condition that her own free
      citizens may not be oppressed by the Federal Government, or brought to trial for their
      humanity by the slave-power? Is the right of delivering men-stealers out of prison without trial, without punishment, a State Right which Ohio
      can exercise, while her judges dare not rescue her own injured citizens from despotism? Are
      the people of Ohio willing that the deliverance of their citizens from unjust imprisonment
      shall be bargained for and bought by the shelter and relase [sic] of rogues and villains that
      deserve to be hanged?</p>
     <p>There is a greater outrage still in this shameful proceeding. We see it noticed that Judge
      Wilson of the United States Court, in pronouncing sentence against young Bushnell for obeying
      God rather than man, in disobeying an unjust law, declared "that if the standard of right is
      placed above and against the laws of the land, those who act up to that standard are anything
      else than good citizens or good Christians."</p>
     <p>What insolent defiance of God and his Word, God and his righteousness, God and the authority
      of his righteousness, by such a judge! The standard of right is God's law, God's Word; and
      here we have a judge of the United States Court declaring the laws of the land superior to it,
      and to be obeyed rather than the right, and that he who acts rightly, when the right is
      against the human law, is anything rather than a good citizen or a good Christian! What a
      teacher of injustice and immorality by law, in our highest public tribunals! What denial of
      the common law, common sense, common liberty, and common piety, of all Christian communities!
      The teaching by a judge upon the bench that unrighteous law can make wrong right, and bind the
      conscience to subjection, is the destruction of public, private, and personal morality; it
      corrupts the very fountain of our principles, and constitutes itself a fountain of debauchery
      and wickedness. It subverts the foundations of our freedom, destroys the very possibility of
      resistance against tyranny, perverts and palsies the conscience and the heart, which alone can
      justify, under instruction of God's Word, and impel and sustain such resistance, in reliance
      upon God. It is treason against the country and against God. It is extra-judicial insolence
      and impiety; but it is perfectly consonant with the equally impious and intrusive dictum now being thrust upon the country as the highest law, that black
      men have no rights that white men are bound to respect! C.</p>

<b>A Yankee Trick</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A funny anecdote about a stupid Irishman and his inability to learn a "Yankee trick."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
     <p>We remember when we were living down east, of a neighboring farmer hiring a jolly Irishman,
      who was very fond of learning tricks. One day his employer asked him if he wouldn't like to
      "larn a Yankee trick." Bringing him to the end of a brick barn, Jonathan laid his open hand
      against the wall, remarking --</p>
     <p>"Pat, I'll bet the liquor you cannot hit my hand.",</p>
     <p>"It's done!" says Pat, making a vicious blow at the palm of his hand, but it being quickly
      withdrawn he succeeded in peeling the skin and flesh from off his knuckles.</p>
     <p>"That's a d--d nasty trick!" roared Pat, but howled on, "I'll cheat somebody else!"</p>
     <p>"[sic] A few months passed, and Pat's brother came over from Ireland, as green as early
      peas. They both labored together, but Pat was uneasy till he would have learned his brother
      the Yankee trick.</p>
     <p>"Jim, did you ever learn a Yankee trick l' [sic]</p>
     <p>"Niver."</p>
     <p>Pat finding himself in the centre of a large field, thought it would be a great loss of time
      to go to the barn, and reaching out his open hand he cried --</p>
     <p>"Strike that, if you can!"</p>
     <p>Jim made a desperate pass, but Pat, having pulled away his hand, Jim fell after the blow,
      remarking that that was an old woman's tick [sic].</p>
     <p>"Try it now!" shrieked Pat, with laughter, placing the same open hand against his own mouth.</p>
     <p>Jim prepared for a sockdolager, and bringing his massive "bunch of fives" in loving
      proximity with Pat's nose and mouth, who pulled away his hand as before, he sent him reeling
      to the earth with the loss of four teeth and a large quantity of blood, for "larning him the
      Yankee trick."</p>

      this matter we clip the following from the Carlisle Herald,
      endorsing heartily every sentiment it expresses favorable to the present gentlemanly,

     <p>"The amount of investment, by many of our citizens in the capital stock of this road, and
      the large interests held by individuals, engaged in the business of forwarding, in the shape
      of warehouses, rolling stock, &amp;c., has caused some excitement in regard to the rumors
      that the Pennsylvania Railroad Company had purchased largely of its stock. Fears have been
      entertained that this gigantic corporation had stretched an arm of power over the Cumberland
      Valley Road, heretofore considered local in its character, and quiet and efficient its
      management, rendering most valuable service to the community whose business it did, returning
      remunerative profits to its stockholders, and commanding an amount of confidence rarely
      incident to any corporate work; some supposing that this management is to be broken down, and
      their investments thus rendered uncertain and speculative -- others, having interests at stake
      of another kind, that the Penn'a. R. R. Co. would assume the Company business, and that thus
      individual interests and capital would be sunk -- and others again, that the general interests
      of the Cumberland Valley Company would be made subservient to, and dependent upon, the
      successful operation of the Pennsylvania R. R. Co. and its City management. In distant
      counties, as we see from our exchanges, it is confidently asserted that the entire road,
      without reserve, has been sold to the Penn'a. Company; but they considerately inform their
      readers, that the terms of the sale and transfer have not yet transpired!</p>
     <p>"Whilst we could not, ourself, entertain the idea that the Penn'a. Railroad Company, with so
      intelligent a head as the gentleman who now presides over its operations, would inaugurate any
      policy destructive of the vested interests of this road, or deem it of importance to the
      interests of the Penn'a. Company to interfere materially with a system of management which has
      brought the Cumberland Valley Railroad Co. to that high degree of credit, attained by few, if
      any, railroad companies in the country. Yet, as a public journalist, we have conceived it to
      be our duty to make inquiry from an authentic source, upon this subject so important to very
      many of our citizens.</p>
     <p>"Our information leads us to the conclusion, First: That there is no danger to be
      apprehended to any interest whatever, from the action taken by the Pennsylvania Railroad
      Company. The contingent fund of that Company has been invested in the purchase of about nine
      thousand shares of the capital stock of the Cumberland Valley Railroad Company. Railroad
      Companies, like individuals, seek to promote, at all points, their business interests, and as
      the trade of this valley, seeking a market at Philadelphia, is a large and increasing
      business, it is natural that the Pennsylvania Railroad Company should seek to obtain it, in
      preference to letting it go over their rival road, the Lebanon Valley; and they have reason to
      believe that the largest interest in the Cumberland Valley Road, of which they have possessed
      themselves, will be a sufficient inducement to the business men of this valley, whose
      interests, so far as the road is concerned, is now identified with theirs, so to direct the
      trade of the valley as will best promote their common interests.</p>
     <p>"Second: That it is not the wish or design of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company to divert
      their stock or business, in any shape, from the line of their own road, but to concentrate
      their efforts to promote their interests there, by all legitimate means.</p>
     <p>"The contest, which is now waging between the great roads leading from the West to the East,
      is a question of great interest to the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, and indeed, to
      Pennsylvania itself, and, doubtless, one which that Company has kept steadily in view. How far
      Western connections, leading directly to the city of New York, and thus ignoring our own
      metropolis and their road, have entered into the views of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company,
      in their present purchase of stock in this road, we are not advised, but it strikes us as
      being a wise policy that they should look forward to these things.</p>
     <p>"So large an investment as the contingent fund of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company in the
      stock of the Cumberland Valley Railroad, is an earnest of the confidence reposed in its
      capital and management, by one whose sagacity in Railroad management is proverbial, and it
      cannot for a moment be supposed that any policy will be introduced that would tend to
      depreciate its present value."</p>

     Coroner, held an inquest.<br>(Names in announcement:  T. WrightEsq.)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
     <p>On Thursday last, the 4th inst., in pursuance of previous arrangements, a magnificent Parade
      came off [i]n Shippensburg, of the two Companies of Firemen, Vigilent [sic] and Cumberland
      Valley, of that place and their invited guests -- consisting of the following Companies:</p>
     <p>Citizen, of Harrisburg; Hope and Friendship, of Chambersburg; Union, Cumberland and Good
      Will, of Carlisle; Washington, of Mechanicsburg; and the Empire Hook and Ladder Company of
      Carlisle, ten companies in all, numberlng [sic] about 750 men.</p>
     <p>The display was very imposing. The streets presented a beautiful appearance, being spanned
      at regular intervals with handsome arches of evergreens, interspersed with most beautiful
      flowers. The hospitality of the good citizens of Shippensburg far outshone, however, the
      beautiful scenery upon the exterior of the houses. Could we have eaten as often as we were
      invited, we could have supplied our inward man with enough for a fortnight, or longer. We had
      often heard Shippensburg spoken of as a great place for pretty girls but when we beheld them
      for ourself, on Thursday last, we were ready to exclaim, with a certain Queen of old, "the
      half had not been told us." We doubt not, Shippensburg was gratified at the large turn-out of
      the people to witness the Parade; and we are certain that all the visitors were more than
      satisfied with the treatment they received at the hands of the kind and hospitable citizens of
      that ancient borough.</p>
     <p>We regret to be compelled to record the fact that two young men, firemen, the pride of
      parental hearts, and highly popular with their companions, lost their lives while returning
      from the Parade. Captain JAMES McCARTNEY, son of Maj. McCartney, of Carlisle, was crushed
      beneath a car, at Newville, which he was attempting to climb upon while in motion. He was so
      horribly mangled that he died in several hours after the accident. -- No blame can possibly
      attach to the Railroad Company or any of its employees. They did all in their power to prevent
      any person getting injured; but they could not guard against a man jumping in the way of
      danger while the train was in motion.</p>
     <p>The other was a young man by the name of WILLIAM RUTTINGER, a blacksmith by occupation, and
      a native of Bedford County, in this State. He was found dead by the engineer of the freight
      train, on Friday morning about daylight -- three and a half miles east of this place. His
      remains were immediately brought to town, and T. J. WRIGHT, Esq., acting as Coroner held an
      inquest over the body. The verdict of the jury is that the deceased was lying upon the track
      and was killed by the cars which came to town from Shippensburg at 11 o'clock on Thursday
      night. He had been upon the 7 o'clock train and lost his hat, about six miles from
      Chambersburg. He left the cars at Scotland Station, 5 miles from town, and walked back for his
      hat. He must have taken sick, after walking the three or four miles, which he did, as he had
      vomited upon the road, but a short distance from where his mangled body was found. He was,
      evidently, lying upon the road below the reach of the cow-catcher; as no marks can be found
      upon it -- which would have been the case if he had been standing up, or even in a sitting
      posture.</p>
     <p>The night was quite dark and he was not seen by the careful Engineer. All the care which
      prudence could suggest was exercised. Col. LULL, the indefatigable Superintendent, passed over
      the road himself, a number of times, on that day, with the word of caution constantly on his
      lips. The Jury, after a close investigation, acquitted the Company, and its attachees, of all
      blame.</p>
