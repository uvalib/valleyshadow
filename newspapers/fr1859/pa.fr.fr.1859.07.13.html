<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We remarked in our last issue, that a young man named Foreman, had committed
                        suicide near Quincy by hanging himself. The sad affair, it appears, took
                        place near Upton. The following particulars we clip from the Waynesboro' Record:</p>
                    <p>Suicide.--We have been pained to learn that W. H. Foreman, son of Mr. Jacob
                        Foreman, of Quincy township,, committed suicide on Monday morning last, near
                        Upton in this county, by hanging himself by the neck with a plowline in his
                        Uncle's barn. We have heard no cause assigned for the commission of the
                        deed. Mr. F. was a young man about 23 or 25 years of age. He formerly taught
                        school in this vicinity, and was well know to many of our citizens.</p>
                    <p>P. S. We since learn from a reliable source that the above act of
                        self-destruction is attributed to disappointment of marriage contract. It
                        appears that the lady to whom young Foreman was engaged was opposed by one
                        of her parents, and was thus induced to discard him, which doubtless had the
                        affect to partially derange his mind.</p>
