<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A bitter condemnation of the southern slave power as soiling the ideals of
                    the old Republic. Where the Founders stood for principles, the Southern
                    Democracy induces Americans to retreat from their principles in the hope of

                    Democrats for caving in to their Southern brethren in this regard. The result is
                    a most unfavorable comparison between the Founding Fathers and President

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>--The annual election for Burgess, Town Counsel, School Directors,
                        &amp;c., took place in Chambersburg on Monday last, and the People's
                        Ticket was most triumphantly sustained. Strange as it may seem, it is
                        nevertheless the fact, that Republicans and Locofocos, Jews and Gentiles,
                        Catholics and Protestants, all joined in voting the same identical Ticket-a
                        Ticket formed by a meeting of the People's Party on the Friday evening
                        previous. Such a Unanimity of political sentiment, probably, never has been
                        exhibited in any town of the same population, in Pennsylvania.</p>
                    <p>The Locofocos, it is true, marshalled by a few disaffected and factious
                        members of the Opposition, made a dead set at one of the School Directors on
                        the People's Ticket.-They led off in the support of Hon. Wilson Reilly, but
                        they were most gloriously defeated. Out of a poll of some 400 votes Mr.
                        Henninger's majority was no less than 58! This triumphant support, in view
                        of the means made use of to defeat him, is alike creditable to Mr. H., as
                        well as to the citizens of our Borough-it is a most emphatic approval and
                        endorsement of his previous acts as School Director, and a proud vindication
                        from the aspersions of his opponents.</p>
                    <p>The following is the Ticket that was elected:</p>
                    <p>Burgess.-I.H. McCauley.</p>
                    <p>Town Council.-A. D. Kaufman, Geo. Flack, Andrew

<b>Our Town</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>

                    new construction and civic projects.<br>(Names in announcement:   ,   )</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>--For twenty years past our town has not witnessed the same spirit of
                        improvement that is now manifested in every quarter. The buildings that have
                        been and those that are now being erected, embracing some twenty-five or
                        thirty, are of the most substantial and durable kind, and we hear of a
                        number of other buildings that are to be erected the present, as well as
                        others that will be put up the next season. While many of our citizens are
                        thus engaged in improving our town in the erection of new buildings, many
                        others are adding decided improvements to their present residences by
                        remodeling and repairing them, thus furnishing a large amount of employment
                        to our mechanics and laboring people.</p>
                    <p>Chambersburg, at present, is decidedly on the increase, in improvements, in
                        population, and in wealth, and we look forward to the day when it will
                        become one of the very prominent and most populous inland towns of
                        Pennsylvania, as it is now one of the prettiest and most pleasant. We
                        possess the facilities for extensive manufacturing of various kinds- are
                        surrounded by a rich and productive soil, and but a few years more will
                        elapse before we are placed in direct Railroad communication with the South,
                        as we are now with the East and West.</p>
                    <p>The Franklin Railroad is now being re-laid, and the work is progressing very
                        rapidly.-With the hands there employed, as well as the bustle and stir among
                        our own people, gives to our town quite a business-like appearance.</p>
