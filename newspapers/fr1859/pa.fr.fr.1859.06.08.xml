                <excerpt> "The majority to pass a law depriving the minority of any unalienable
                    right, reducing them, it may be, into hopeless slavery, would be a law of <emph

                    are held in a state of unpaid servitude; yet it is insulting to the attribute of
                    the Deity to call such barbarous cruelty by the holy name of <emph rend="italic"
                        >justice</emph>." </excerpt>
                <transcript>
                    <p>Under the above caption the <emph rend="italic">Valley Spirit</emph> of the
                        25th ult., undertakes to defend the unholy decision of the Supreme Court of
                        the United States, in the Dred Scott case. The language of the Chief Justice
                        is most unblushingly, most wickedly denied, in order to make out a plausable
                        pretext for bestowing praise upon an unworthy object.</p>
                    <p>The Supreme Court of the United States, the highest judicial tribunal in the
                        country- the court of the last resort -has had upon its bench some of the
                        brightest legal intellects in the civilized world. The decisions of that
                        body, in its purer days- when really great men were robed in its official
                        ermine -were quoted with approbation and were received as oracles of wisdom,
                        justice and law, in every country, and in every clime, where a court of law
                        is the arbiter of the rights of man with his fellow men. In those days the
                        chief object with that august tribunal was "to do justly, and to love
                        mercy." Now the powers with which that important branch of the government
                        are clothed are all basely prostituted to crush out every principle of
                        justice and mercy which is incorporated in our Constitution; our bill of
                        rights, and in the Magna charta of our liberty- the immortal Declaration of
                        Independence.--It is any wonder then, that the descendents of Revolutionary
                        Sires -the lovers of liberty in its largest sense, and its fullest
                        signification- should spurn with contempt the edict of any body of men,
                        which would circumscribe within improper bounds the workings of our glorious
                        system of American independence and freedom? No man who has ten drops of the
                        blood of a defender of our liberties, upon the tented field of battle,
                        coursing through his veins, can calmly, contemplate the horrible wickedness;
                        the jesuitical, insiduous betrayal of the dearest rights of freemen which is
                        embodied in Roger B. Taney's opinion in that ever memorable case.</p>
                    <p>Who is Roger B. Taney? Who is this <emph rend="italic">wonderful</emph> (?)
                        man -whom Locofocos would have us look upon as "a Daniel come to judgment."
                        The least said about him will least damage his reputation. We would have
                        suffered the hoary old reprobate to pass down to merited oblivion, without
                        this notice, if the political slave of the <emph rend="italic">Spirit</emph>
                        had not compelled us to put him thus upon record. Taney is the man who dared
                        to remove the deposits of the Government from the vaults of the National
                        Bank, at the request of President Jackson, without any legal authority and
                        in direct defiance of an act of Congress. This willful trampling upon the
                        statute, of the highest law-making power in the land, was the <emph
                            rend="italic">great recommendation</emph> with General Jackson when he
                        appointed him to the elevated position of chief justice of the Supreme Court
                        of the land; showing that <emph rend="italic">obedience</emph> to his
                        mandates was the highest <emph rend="italic">necessary</emph> qualification
                        for appointment to any office in his gift with the then chief executive.
                        Taney commenced his career as a public man, by an open violation of law,
                        arising from a blind subserviency to party spirit, and he was the man of all
                        men, to give utterence to the reeking historical falsehoods, and legal
                        misrepresentations of the Dred Scott case.</p>
                    <p>Our neighbor calls us to task for having, as it alleges, wilfully represented
                        the statement of Taney in the opinion he delivered against justice; against
                        law; against freedom; against history; against truth. They feel that the
                        hellish doctrine which that opinion contains is so subversive of the dearest
                        rights of our people that unless it can be recalled, or the masses made to
                        believe he never uttered such dark sentences, the effect will be to entirely
                        destroy the last vestige of locofoco dominion in the free states' hence
                        their anxiety to cover the black record over with a frost work of lies.
                        Below we give the identical language to be found in the opinion of Judge
                        Taney.</p>
                    <p>"It is difficult at this day to realize the state of public opinion in
                        relation to that unfortunate race, which prevailed in the civilized and
                        enlightened portions of the world at the time of the Declaration of
                        Independence, and when the Constitution of the United States was framed and
                        adopted. But the public history of every European nation displays it in a
                        manner too plain to be mistaken.</p>
                    <p>They had for more than a century before been regarded as beings of an
                        inferior order, and altogether unfit to associate with the white race,
                        either in social or political relations; and so inferior, THAT THEY HAD NO
                        RIGHTS WHICH THE WHITE MAN WAS BOUND TO RESPECT; and that the negro might
                        justly and lawfully be reduced to slavery for his benefit."</p>
                    <p>The foul stench of political sophistry, arising from this subtle document is
                        enough to cause the virtuous portion of civilized humanity to turn their
                        heads in disgust from us as a people; holding the whole nation responsible
                        for the abominations issuing from the court of highest resort in the land.</p>
                    <p>It is a historical falsehood to say that there is any difficulty whatever in
                        arriving at the state of public opinion with reference to <emph
                            rend="italic">slavery</emph> at the time of adoption of our
                        Constitution; the time of the Declaration of Independence, and for a number
                        of years previous. The universal sentiment was that it was a great evil. All
                        philanthropists were busy devising ways and means for its speedy
                        determination.--It was regarded as the dark shot upon our escutcheon. It is
                        a legal misrepresentation, and no man is better acquainted with the fact
                        than Judge Taney, to make <emph rend="italic">justice</emph> and <emph
                            rend="italic">might</emph> synonymous terms. The majority to pass a law
                        depriving the minority of any unalienable right, reducing them, it may be,
                        into hopeless slavery, would be a law of <emph rend="italic">might</emph>,
                        but not of <emph rend="italic">justice</emph>. However <emph rend="italic"
                            >lawfully</emph> the poor unfortunate sons of Africa are held in a state
                        of unpaid servitude; yet it is insulting to the attribute of the Deity to
                        call such barbarous cruelty by the holy name of <emph rend="italic"
                        >justice</emph>. This Judge Taney does and the <emph rend="italic"
                        >Spirit</emph> glorifies him for the act. If there is any credit connected
                        with such base, canting hypocrisy, the <emph rend="italic">great</emph> (?)
                        judge, and his immortal <emph rend="italic">Spirit</emph> may divide it
                        between them. We want no such glory.</p>

                <summary>This article scores the rival Valley Spirit for defending Judge Taney's
                    Dred Scott decision. It goes on to argue that "descendants of the Revolutionary
                    sires... should spurn with contempt the edict ofanybodyof men, which would
                    circumscribe within improper bounds the workings of our glorious system of
                    American independence and freedom." The article argues that Taney is unfit for
                    the Supreme Court because his chief recommendation for the position was his
                    truckling subservience to President Jackson in removing the federal deposits
                    from the Bank of the United States. It concludes by arguing that before the Dred
                    Scott decision, all reasonable Americans were agreed on the evils of slavery and
                    were devising plans to end it. Taney's verdict threw the force of the federal
                    bench behind slavery, and fatefully re-opened the question.</summary>

                    <p>A cooler piece of impudence, in several respects, could no where else be
                        found, than in the <emph rend="italic">Valley Spirit</emph>, where an
                        abundance is always on hand, to meet every emergency. It requires
                        considerable brass -but what of that, plenty at the <emph rend="italic"
                            >Spirit</emph> office- for any man to claim to be the expected defender
                        of the <emph rend="italic">faith</emph> of a man whom he has denounced in
                        unmeasured terms -showing, among other things, that an utter <emph

                    <p>The <emph rend="italic">faith</emph> of old Buck, ha! ha! ha! -Who struck
                        Billy Patterson? Is he old Buck now, since he has repudiated the Cincinnati
                        Platform? Time was, when he and it were considered synonymous terms by his
                        ardent admirers in these regions. He utterly rejects the following plank in
                        the Platform of the party which elected him, as proclaimed by the convention
                        which put him in nomination, viz:</p>

                        of 1856. What say you to it now? Do you change with the moon? or is the

                        was when he was seeking his election? You know it is not. You know that he
                        has created the widest dissensions in the party, that unwisely elevated to

                        Territories -even in defiance of the wishes of the citizens of the same.

                        infernal <emph rend="italic">faith</emph>? In you consolatory article, you
                        do not profess to proclaim Democratic principles, as annunciated by your
                        last National Convention; but set yourself up as the "defender of the <emph
                            rend="italic">faith</emph> of old BUCK." What a happy time you must have
                        of it.</p>
                    <p>You need not have been alarmed at our praise of Jeffersonian Democracy. No
                        two sets of principles could be more widely at antipodes than those of
                        Jefferson advocating the will of the majority as the supreme authority in a
                        Democracy, and the tyrannical, overbearing dictation of the Oligarchy,
                        backed by the prince of Federalists, (who you familiarly call old Buck)
                        compelling the majority to yield their <emph rend="italic">faith</emph>,
                        their opinions and their <emph rend="italic">conscience</emph>, as well as
                        all their civil rights into the keeping of their self-constituted masters.
                        The genuine Democracy of Jefferson, is so far removed from the spurious
                            <emph rend="italic">faith</emph> of old Buck, that if either had the
                        small pox the other would be in no danger of catching it.</p>
                    <p>Why should you complain at any person advocating Jeffersonianism? You are the
                        defender of the <emph rend="italic">faith</emph> of old Buck, the arch old
                        Federalist. Doubtless you have carefully put away, in cotton, in your
                        office, the identical "jack knife" with which he cut his veins in search of
                            <emph rend="italic">one drop</emph> of Democratic blood. The public have
                        not yet learned whether he ever found that <emph rend="italic">one
                        drop</emph>; certainly no larger quantity ever entered into his composition.</p>
                    <p>We would like to see the articles in the <emph rend="italic">faith</emph> of
                        old Buck published, in your paper, regularly once a month, for a year; and
                        if we can not show <emph rend="italic">twelve</emph> changes in that <emph
                            rend="italic">wonderful</emph> production, in just that number of
                        months, (providing his Southern keepers saw fit to alter their tune that
                        often) then we will do, what no person acquainted with him would like to
                        undertake -call the editor of the <emph rend="italic">Spirit</emph> a
                        consistant politician, for the balance of our natural life.</p>
