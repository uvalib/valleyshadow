                    and Tribune argues that the Administration allow the raid to occur--for later
                    partizan use--; and that the number of troops that the government sent--one
                    platoon--proves that the Administration knew of the actual number of insurgents,

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We are seldom called upon to record a death so sudden and unexpected as that
                        of Mrs. Elizabeth Cooper, of this place, which occurred about 12 o'clock on
                        Sabbath night last. Mrs. Cooper went to the "United Presbyterian Church" (of
                        which she was a most exemplary member) in the evening, in her usual health.
                        She returned, spent the remaining part of the evening with her family, and
                        retired, without having any strong symptoms of sickness. It was near 12
                        o'clock when she complained to her husband of feeling unwell. He immediately
                        gave her such medicine as he thought would afford her relief, but to no
                        purpose. He then called another member of the family, and started for a
                        Physician, but before he arrived her spirit had departed.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. C. was in the 62d year of her age.--The family formerly resided in Adams
                        county, and removed into our midst some seven months ago, but during that
                        short period this estimable lady had gathered around her many ardent
                        friends. Her exemplary walk in life, her strong christian character and
                        amiable disposition had endeared her to all. While her sudden death has
                        caused grief and sorrow among friends and acquaintances, they mourn not as
                        those without hope. "By their fruits shall ye know them."</p>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>--A mulatto man, named Jacob Kelly, somewhat noted as a rowdy, and for the
                        arrest of whom several warrants have been in the hands of our officers for
                        months past, was arrested by an officer the other evening. Kelly, however,
                        broke loose from his captor, and fled. Pursuit was made by the officer and a
                        number of others, and he was overhauled some distance from town and was
                        lodged in jail, where he will remain to take his trial for the various
                        offenses with which he is charged. The most serious charge that is pending
                        against him is an assault and battery committed upon the person of Mr. H.
                        Bowels. He struck him, it is alleged, with a lung-shot in the mouth,
                        breaking out nearly all of his front teeth, and then jumped upon and beat
                        him in a most horrible manner, and would have killed him but for the
                        interference of others, who came to Mr. B.'s relief.</p>
                    <p>When the officers have heretofore undertaken to arrest him, he would
                        intimidate them by drawing a knife, a pistol, or some other weapon, and
                        threaten to use them in case they would attempt to take him, and he has thus
                        been permitted to prowl about in the community almost at his pleasure. He is
                        now within the clutches of the law, and, with others, we trust that full
                        justice will be meted out to him.</p>

                        sure it is not the desire of any member of the Board of Council to withhold
                        from the Company such Apparatus as may be within its means to purchase; but
                        presume their seeming neglect in this respect is owing altogether to the
