                    <p>"Fourth of July." -- Well -- I don't feel patriotic. Perhaps I might if they
                        would stop that deafening racket. Washington was very-well, if he <emph

                        as a woman -- I shouldn't know it, didn't some orator tell me. Can I go out
                        of an evening without a hat at my side? Can I go out with one on my head
                        without danger of a station-house? Can I clap my hands at some public
                        speaker when I am nearly bursting with delight? -- Can I signify the
                        contrary when my hair stands on end with vexation? Can I stand up in the
                        cars "like a gentleman" without being immediately invited "to sit down?" --
                        Can I get into an omnibus without having my sixpence taken from my hand and
                        given to the driver? Can I cross Broadway without having a policeman tackled
                        to my helpless elbow? Can I go to see anything <emph rend="italic"
                        >pleasant,</emph> like an execution or a dissection? Can I drive that
                        splendid "Lantern," distancing -- like his owner -- all competitors? Can I
                        have the nomination for "Governor of Vermont," like our other contributor,
                        John G. Saxe? -- Can I be a Senator, that I may hurry up that millennial,
                        International Copyright Law? -- Can I <emph rend="italic">even</emph> be
                        "President?" Bah -- you know I can't. <emph rend="italic">"Free!"</emph></p>

                        over the fireplace -- lay back in your chair -- light one of your best

                    prepared to go to trial in the libel case brought against them by Col. McClure,

                <summary>Scathing commentary on Brewer's speech at the Democratic meeting, in which
                    he "insisted that there were no vital principles at issue between the great
                    political parties" except "the question of plunder." The author asserts that the
                    People's party, supreme in Franklin County, won't "turn up on itself with
                    suicidal hands and strike at its own vitals" and suggests that Brewer's "funeral
                    arrangements may be postponed indefinitely!"</summary>

                    <p>We have frequently referred, with pride and pleasure, to the spirit of
                        improvement which has so generally taken possession of the citizens of this
                        town, and vicinity; but there is one portion of the town which is a disgrace
                        to any civilized community -- we mean the ragged, dilapidated, worn-out
                        board-walk beyond the Bridge on North Main street. Whose fault is it that
                        this unsafe, unsightly foot-walk continues to annoy all who are compelled to
                        use the dangerous pathway? Let us have the name of the man, or names of the
                        men, who refuse or neglect to repair this much used pavement, and we will
                        put them upon record for future reference -- hand them down to succeeding
                        generations as public spirted (?) [sic] individuals. Last Sabbath, going to
                        and, returning from church, we saw a number of Ladies going into the street
                        for safe walking -- afraid to trust themselves upon the foot-trap. If it is
                        the fault of the Council, we will hoist each member of the board in bold
                        type by way of perpetuating their memory. Something must be done, and that
                        pretty soon, to make this side-walk safe; or the town may have a nice little
                        bill of damages to pay. The gentleman living on this side of the Bridge was
                        compelled to pave the entire length of his lot, from King street to the
                        Bridge; then why cannot the owners of the other side be made subject to the
                        same Ordinance, that governed the case when this side of the Bridge needed
                        paving. Attend to this matter Messrs. Councilmen and save your credit.</p>

                    <p>On Wednesday of last week a lad about 12 years of age, son of Mr. LEONARD
                        NAVE, near Culbertson's Row, a few miles North of this place, went into
                        Nickle's Mill dam to bathe, and, not being able to swim ventured into water
                        too deep for him to wade out of and, before assistance could reach the
                        unfortunate boy he was drowned. A son of M. NICKLE performed a daring feat
                        in recovering the body of the dead boy. He clung to the side of a boat,
                        propelled by others in the boat, with his body under water, feeling with his
                        feet for the body, as the boat was rowed through the dam, till he succeeded
                        in touching the object of his search with his feet, when he dived down and
                        brought it to the surface. The mourning relatives, and the whole community,
                        feel deeply grateful to this brave youth for his successful efforts in
                        rescuing the body. It is greatly regretted that he, the intrepid young man,
                        was not within calling distance to save the life of the unfortunate boy --
                        his little neighbor.</p>

                        and Dr. W. H. BOYLE, who were prosecuted by Col. A. K. McCLURE for libel,
                        were called up in Court and, entered into recognizances for their appearance
                        at the October Term, to answer the charges. They were permitted to give the
                        nominal bail of one hundred dollars each, and go bail for each other. Col.
                        McCLURE was in Court, but kindly permitted this strange, unusual proceeding
                        to take place without interposing a solitary objection. He would not add
                        anything to the torture which these gentlemen are, evidently, enduring. He
                        kindly permitted his bitter foes to get off as easily as they could; but who
                        else could do so? One of the defendants asked us: What would become of the
                        case if they were all to run off? To which we replied: The best thing which
                        could possibly happen to this community.</p>
