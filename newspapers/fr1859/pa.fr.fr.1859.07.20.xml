                    <p>--A Mr. Abraham Ebersole, who resides in Hamilton township, near Cashtown,
                        after having loaded a Threshing Machine, on Monday afternoon last, at the
                        Shop of Mr. C. Stouffer of this place, had his nose broken by his horse. For
                        the purpose of leading the horse out of the yard, after the Machine was
                        loaded, it appears Mr. E. went immediately in front of the horse, when the
                        animal--which is some-what false--immediately reared up, and in coming down
                        his hoof struck Mr. E. in the face, thus inflicting the injury. He was taken
                        into the residence of Mr. Stouffer, when his wound was skillfully dressed by
                        Dr. J. C. Richards. A short time afterwards Mr. E. was enabled to proceed to
                        his home.</p>

                    <p>--There is nothing to be compared to being aroused from sleep by the sweet
                        strains of music. We enjoyed this very pleasant treat on last Thursday
                        night, the 14th inst., about midnight. The Chambersburg Mechanics Brass
                        Band, took it into their heads to lull to sleep the representatives of the
                        Press of this place and, called around in front of the residence of some
                        four Ed-it-ors, and one Ed-et-ter, and discoursed some of their sweetest
                        music. No town in the State can boast of half as good a Band as ours.--The
                        young men composing this excellent musical corps are gentlemen, every one of
                        them. They have no bad habits, and are a credit to the town--long may they
                        wave.</p>

                <excerpt>"The whole address is a direct repudiation, not merely of the ground taken
                    by the party in 1856, but of the positions now occupied by Mr. douglas and his
                    friends. It is a declaration of war against the Douglas men, and we cannot see
                    how it is possible for any democrat who sympathises with Douglas, to give his
                    support to the Democratic State Ticket."</excerpt>
