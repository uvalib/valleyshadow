<b>Gov. Packer's Annual Message</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository gleefully notes the Valley Spirit's silence on the
                    governor's recent address, which failed to support notable Democratic positions
                    on the sale of the public works, free trade, slavery and "nullification and
                    disunion." "Mr. Packer has seen proper to take the reverse of the above
                    positions, and the consequ4ence is that a large number of the so-called
                    Democratic papers of the State are denouncing him for the independent utterance
                    of his views, and the Spirit is as mum as the grave, which is equivalent to an
                    open opposition."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Gov. Packer's Annual Message appeared in the Spirit last week without a solitary word of comment, pro or con,
                        upon its merits, or without ever saying to the reader--"In this number of
                        the Spirit will be found Gov. Packer's first annual Message." Had his Excellency denounced
                        the sale of the Public Works, our neighbor would have thrown up his hat in
                        ecstasy; had he favored the Free Trade policy of the English Merchants and
                        Manufacturers--a policy that has been forced upon the Democratic party by
                        its wild and reckless Southern leaders, and which has worked so disastrously
                        to the great interests of our own county--a chuckling grin would and he
                        would have and he would have [sic] clapped his hands with joy; had the
                        Message contained an argument in behalf of the beauties of Slavery and of
                        the Slave Trade, it would have been, doubtless, eulogized by our neighbor as
                        one of notible [sic] merit, and its author, as a Democrat of the straightest
                        sect; had the Governor advocated the extreme views of the Southern leaders
                        of the Democratic party-views that germinate only in the hot-beds of
                        nullification and disunion--the Spirit would have
                        urged his claims upon the Charleston Convention as its favorite candidate
                        for the Presidency in 1860.</p>
                    <p>But Mr. Packer has seen proper to take the reverse of the above positions,
                        and the consequence is that a large number of the so-called Democratic
                        papers of the State are denouncing him for the independent utterance of his
                        views, and the Spirit is a mum as the grave,
                        which is equivalent to an open opposition.</p>
