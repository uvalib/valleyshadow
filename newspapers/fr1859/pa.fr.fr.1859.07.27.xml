                    might be some excuse for this act; but when he is assailed by cowardly

                    doom, the community is justly startled at the freedom with which the moral
                    assassin seems to think his fiendish calling may be practiced with impunity."</excerpt>
                <transcript>
                    <p>The annals of decent journalism cannot furnish a parrallel [sic] for the
                        mingled imbecility and malice with which the <emph rend="italic"
                        >Spirit</emph> of last week assails Col. McClure. He is not in nomination
                        for any public position--our party has as yet presented no candidate for the
                        suffrages of the people--nor is he traversing the County asking to be made
                        the candidate. If he should be presented to the voters of the county as our
                        candidate for any responsible trust--as the <emph rend="italic"
                        >Spirit</emph> seems to fear will be the case--it will be because our party
                        desires him to be one of its standard bearers, and not because he has gone
                        from one section of the County to another, as is usual with candidates,
                        seeking the honors his political friends have to confer. He is a private
                        citizen--pursuing his private calling--offending none, either personally or
                        politically; and yet he is singled out by the <emph rend="italic"
                        >Spirit</emph> for a torrent of personal malignity unapproached by any other
                        partisan journal within our recollection. Had he been assailed politically,
                        however unwarranted at this time, there might be some excuse for this act;
                        but when he is assailed by cowardly innuendoes, as but a living mass of
                        corruption, and as fit only for a felon's doom, the community is justly
                        startled at the freedom with which the moral assassin seems to think his
                        fiendish calling may be practiced with impunity.</p>
                    <p>We have never known such a feeling of condemnation to pervade this community
                        as has been aroused by the flood of libels poured upon Col. McClure by that
                        paper. Our citizens, as with one voice, both political friends and foes of
                        Col. McClure, have spoken out in terms of fearless disapprobation. The
                        leading men of the Democratic party have disavowed all responsibility for
                        the unscrupulous libeler of the <emph rend="italic">Spirit</emph>, and wash
                        their hands of the indelible stain it would fasten upon their party, if
                        endorsed by its good men.</p>
                    <p>Independent of the impolicy of such a malicious system of personal warfare
                        upon one who has enjoyed the most decisive evidences of the confidence of
                        the people, there are few men in the Democratic party whose sense of justice
                        would not revolt at such infamous assaults upon the private character of any
                        man; for that sense of the proprieties and common decencies of life is
                        instinctive in the human breast, and can only fail to assert its power when
                        the most fiendish depravity destroys every honest emotion of the soul. Such
                        assaults, hurled upon a community where respect for personal reputation is
                        proverbial, fall harmless at the feet of the intended victim, and recoil
                        with terrible force upon those who aim them. They unite all citizens as one
                        common brotherhood, as they would unite to guard against pestilence, to
                        vindicate the object of the libeler's venom; because none is safe from his
                        pestiferous breath.</p>
                    <p>We do not defend Col. McClure--he needs no defense in this community, where
                        he is best known, and where he is appreciated as an honest, upright, liberal
                        and useful citizen, and as a fearless but honorable politician. It is but
                        just alike to himself and many ardent friends, however, to say, <emph
                            rend="italic">that he has now in his possession the most conclusive
                            evidence of the utter falsity of the cowardly libels heaped upon him by
                            the Spirit, and that he will promptly and unequivocally vindicate
                            himself in a manner that will fully justify the confidence of his
                            friends and command the respect of even his defamers</emph>.</p>
                    <p>We annex the following article from Forney's <emph rend="italic">Press</emph>
                        of yesterday:</p>
                    <p>The absence of personalities in the most of the newspapers published in
                        Pennsylvania is one of the healthy signs of the times. Not many years ago
                        most of our interior journals were occupied in great part by violent
                        assaults upon the public men of their respective vicinities. We are glad to
                        notice that a wholesome public opinion has cured this evil, and that
                        although the divisions between great parties continue as strongly as ever,
                        there is an active rivalry among editors to maintain courteous and kindly
                        relations.</p>
                    <p> There are, it is true, exceptions to this rule, but they are as odious as
                        they are rare. One of these exceptions we notice in a paper printed at
                        Chambersburg, called the <emph rend="italic">Valley Spirit</emph>--a late
                        number of which contains a coarse and passionate attack upon Col A. K.
                        McClure, late a representative in the Legislature for Franklin Co.</p>
                    <p>We are not of Col. McClure's party, and therefore do not speak of him from
                        political affinity; but a somewhat intimate knowledge of his character, and
                        a somewhat close observation of his course as a public man, impel us to
                        declare that we wish Pennsylvania could boast of more such patriotic and
                        public-spirited citizens. Bold in the expression of his opinions, and
                        therefore well calculated to provoke enmity on the part of those who may be
                        adverse to him, we do not know where there is to be found one in whom public
                        trust can be more safely reposed, and who would go farther to sacrifice
                        himself for the interests of his constituents. The idea that such a man
                        could be guilty of anything mercenary or corrupt is an absurdity.</p>
                    <p>We have watched his career with some interest, and believe that if there is a
                        true hearted Pennsylvanian and good citizen anywhere, that man is Col. A. K.
                        McClure, of Franklin county.</p>

                <summary>Story responds to the Adams Co. Sentinel's fears that Franklin County will
                    nominate Alexander K. McClure for the State Senate, and that his victory will
                    bode ill for other counties. The Repository notes that no candidate has yet been
                    placed in nomination and that it published recommendations for TWO candidates in
                    its pages (not just McClure). It concludes that Franklin Republicans "do not
                    mean in any degree to ignore the wishes or proferences of the other counties in
                    the district."</summary>

                        in Letterkenny township and who is aged seventy one years, was engaged doing
                        his days work in the hay field, last week, and not only keeping up with, but
                        pushing, the stoutest hands in the field. He has worked through the entire
                        hay and grain harvest every year for fifty five years successively, and
                        expects to cradle through the present harvest with as much buoyancy of
                        spirit, if not quite as much bodily strength, as he did half a century ago.

                        Chippawa, and Lundy's Lane, and was, for one month an adjutant under Scott.
