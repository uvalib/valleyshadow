<b>Legislative Divorcement</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A discussion on the justifiable reasons for divorce.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The law recognises marriage as a civil contract. This contract is binding
                        till death separates the parties thereto; but, for certain good reasons, a
                        wise provision for separating those who either never should have been
                        united, or should no longer be compelled to remain in that condition, by
                        courts of competent jurisdiction, and by legislative enactment, is fully
                        recognised in Pennsylvania. Cases frequently occur where the peace and
                        happiness of men and women would be entirely destroyed, but for this humane
                        provision in our laws. Imprisonment for life in the dreary cell of a
                        penitentiary would be vastly preferable to being compelled to drag out a
                        miserable existance [sic] as the husband or wife of one whom all the
                        instincts and holier impulses of our nature prompted us to loathe.</p>
                    <p>Marriage, to be productive of the objects designed by its institution, must
                        be based upon true, genuine affection. Love, pure and unalloyed, must be its
                        mainspring, its governing and controlling principle, and sympathy and
                        congeniallity [sic] pervade its every part and particle. Where these are
                        wanting, solitary and hopeless indeed must be the forlorn condition of the
                        unfortunate being who, lured by deceptive appearances and false
                        anticipations, plunged into the most galling of all earthly yokes which a
                        mortal could be called upon to bear. We would rather undergo the tortures of
                        an inquisition than be obliged to drag out a hopeless existance [sic] with
                        one whom we had married from the purest of motives, but in whom we could not
                        find one congenial element. If the Legislature could not annul the marriage
                        contract, but for the reasons which influence Courts of law to interfere,
                        then indeed would many poor mortals be forced to undergo a living, unending
                        torture.</p>
                    <p>The cases wherein the Courts are permitted to grant a divorce are: where
                        either of the parties can prove, by disinterested
                            evidence, that the other has been guilty of adultery; has
                        deserted his or her home; has, by deeds of cruelty, rendered life
                        burthensome and intolerable to the other, and where either has been
                        convicted of an infamous crime. All these may be established by competent
                        testimony. Either of them is a sufficient cause for granting the prayer of
                        the petitioner. No living mortal will deny the justice of a decree, issued,
                        upon the establishment of either of the foregoing causes of complaint, by a
                        Court of Common Pleas, after a full, fair and impartial investigation of the
                        facts of the case. Then, if for either of these reasons the marriage
                        contract may be set aside, why may it not be abrogated for other equally
                        good considerations? It frequently occurs that husbands perpetrate acts of
                        cruelty in the retirement and privacy of the marriage chamber, galling in
                        the extreme to a sensative [sic], noble minded, pure woman, which render
                        life burthensome and the existance [sic] of a wife intolerable, but rather
                        than expose which, she becomes a martyr to the petty tyranny of an
                        unfeeling, a heartless husband.</p>
                    <p>Take either of the causes for which a divorce may be granted by a Court, and
                        analize [sic] it. Adultery, for instance. This is admitted, by all, to be
                        the highest crime against the marital relation. Why is it any more heinous
                        than either of the other causes? The answer is, that it works corruption of
                        blood. This can only be the case where procreation is its result. But will a
                        Court hesitate about pronouncing adultery a crime, until it produce
                        offspring? We answer, no. Then there must be some other cause than
                        corruption of blood for the utter detestation with which all pure minds
                        regard this foul offense. What is it? It produces unhappiness. Yes, that is
                        the secret; it does produce unhappiness. So does desertion produce
                        unhappiness; so does the conviction of a husband or wife of an infamous
                        crime and incarceration in a prison, produce to their partner unhappiness;
                        so does cruelty produce unhappiness. Nor is the unhappiness produced by the
                        latter any the less intolerable [sic] because the victim can not prove the
                        body of the offense to the satisfaction of a Court and Jury. We infer,
                        therefore, that the pith of all the legal causes of divorce, is that they each are
                        fruitful causes of unhappiness. We take the liberty, then of saying to the
                        assembled wisdom of the State: gentlemen of the Senate and House of
                        Representatives, whenever a poor, bleeding heart comes before you, weighted
                        down with untold, unexplainable unhappiness, praying you to release it from
                        the load of oppression with which it is shackled, exercise the powers with
                        which you are invested; burst the bonds which fetter a soul; let the
                        imprisoned captive go free, and you will have performed an act of simple
                        justice, and will, thereby, strew the pathway of a fellow mortal with
                        blessings, by exercising the heavenly attribute--mercy.</p>
                    <p>A case is now before our Legislature which calls loudly for the exercise of
                        this prerogative by that body. A Mrs. Fry, of Philadelphia, comes before our
                        law-makers, and asks to be released from the bonds which bind her to a man
                        who cannot appreciate her worth. We have not seen her petition or statement;
                        but we have seen that of her husband, and it alone satisfies us that the
                        prayer of the lady should be granted, without the least hesitation. We hope
                        the many able, talented and manly gentlemen who have the honor to represent
                        the people in the Senate and House, will do justice to their own clear heads
                        and generous hearts, and to their constituency, by vindicating the cause of
                        this unhappy wife--this heart-crushed young woman. We want no better
                        evidence than the statement of Mr. Fry, published in the New York Police Gazette, to satisfy us that he (whom we do
                        not personally know, and, therefore, against whom we have no prejudice,
                        whatever) is entirely too overbearing to be allowed to hold the happiness of
                        any female subject to his caprice. He there shows that between himself and
                        his wife there never can exist the proper domestic relations, and yet he
                            claims the right to say when, where, how, and
                        upon what terms and conditions his sorrowing wife may be released from his
                        relentless grasp. The two houses of the State Legislature will be doing the
                        world a favor by trampling upon this petty tyranny. Burst the cords,
                        gentlemen, which trammel this victim of an improper marriage, and let the
                        captive escape from her cruel bondage, and you will look back to this act as
                        one of the most pleasing reminiscences of your lives.</p>
