<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Locofoco Slaughter House.</p>
                    <p>The Locofoco County Convention met in this place on Tuesday of last week,
                        and, in obedience to the dictates of the chief managers in Chambersburg,
                        nominated the following ticket:</p>
                    <p> Senator--J. Wyeth Douglas, of Chambersb'g; <br> Sheriff--Jacob Sellers, of
                        Chambersburg; <br> District Att'y., G. W. Welsh, of Chambersburg; <br>
                        Treasurer--Jacob C. Snider, of Guilford; <br> Assembly--R. W. McAllen, of
                        Metal; <br> Commissioner--Jonathan Jacoby, of Antrim; <br>
                        Surveyor--George Stinger, of Peters; <br> Director of the Poor--Wm.
                        McClure, of Green; <br> Auditor--Josiah Allen, of Hamilton, (3 yr's) <br>
                        and Jacob Elliott, of Montgomery, (2 yr's.) <br> Coroner--Dr. Max. Kennedy,
                        of Orrstown.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Douglas received the nomination for Senator by acclamation, as no one
                        else would accept it. Nill was earnestly urged to take the field, but he
                        thought discretion the better part of valor, and peremptorily declined by a
                        letter written to the Convention.</p>
                    <p> The bloody feat of the day performed by the wire-pullers, was in the
                        nomination for Sheriff. They had united on Sellers as their favorite, and
                        resolved to put him through at all hazards. The masses of the party rebelled
                        in almost every section of the county.--They carried the Delegates over the
                        slaughter-house heroes in both Wards here; in Hamilton; in Guilford, and
                        other localities for Braud [sic] ; and in Waynesboro, Quincy, Fayetteville,
                        and a portion of the Antrim Delegates for Seacrist: but all would not avail.
                        The leaders had resolved that Brand and Seacrist must be sacrificed, and
                        after a most desperate struggle it was done. Sellers had been the candidate
                        for Prothonotary in 1854; was Clerk to the Commissioners in 1855; was a
                        candidate for Register and Recorder in 1857, and was re-appointed Clerk to
                        the Commissioners in the same year; and the party revolted at his persistent
                        efforts to monopolize the honors of the party. This result had to be
                        counteracted. It could not be done by fair means, and it had to be done
                        otherwise. Quincy had voted independently on one or two occasions, and
                        although she has time and again saved portions of the ticket, and stands now
                        as the banner township of the county, a systematic effort was made to
                        prejudice the party against the township and Mr. Seacrist, her candidate. It
                        was circulated in every section of the county that Seacrist must not be
                        nominated--he had voted for McClure, in 1857. And this system of
                        assassination was practised day after day by men who had voted against men
                        on the ticket, five times for Seacrist's ore. But
                        no matter, it was the only way to defeat him, and he had to go down; but he
                        made a fight before he yielded that struck terror to the managers of the
                        slaughter-house. Brand was thrown over with less ceremony. The leaders took
                        possession of his Delegates as they came to town, and took some eight or ten
                        of his avowed friends from him before the Convention met. He had bearded the
                        wire-pullers in their strong-hold, and beaten them two to one; but they
                        laughed at him in his triumph, and bid him to beware of Convention day. True
                        to their threats, they slaughtered him, with even indecent haste, and
                        finally gained their point--the nomination of Sellers--on the 4th ballot.
                        But the victims did not bow to the block as meekly as was supposed. They and
                        their friends revolted, and fully one-third of the Delegates declared
                        publicly before they left town, that Sellers and the slaughter-house
                        managers must be beaten. Let them look out for "Hail Columbia" from
                        Chambersburg, Quincy and Washington about the second Tuesday of October.</p>
                    <p>Snider was nominated for Treasurer over Fisher by a decided vote on first
                        ballot, to the surprise of everybody. It was the work of revenge. Fisher was
                        suspected of having been into the slaughter-house arrangement, by which
                        Seacrist and Brand were beheaded; and the guillotine feel upon him fatally.
                        Seacrist's friends especially came to the rescue of Snider--a man they
                        didn't want--and gave him 14 majority. So the slaughter was not confined to
                        the victims marked for destruction.</p>
                    <p>The District Attorneyship was warmly contested by Orr, Welsh and Everett. But
                        Everett was headed off as per arrangement.--The convenient argument that he
                        was new in the party--that he had even dared to split his ticket--was
                        applied to him, and down he had to go. Orr and Welsh were left; and although
                        Orr had been checked and ticketed through by the managers, his car switched
                        off and Welsh made the landing. The party are willing to stand the Orrs all
                        the time in office, if they will consent to work in single harness; but when
                        it was proposed by the leaders to drive them into office double the team
                        broke down. The managers had overlooked this fact--had over-estimated the
                        docility of the party, and thus missed the head of Welsh.</p>
                    <p>Gen. R. W. McAllen was nominated for Assembly, and is a creditable nominee.
                        He too was in the slaughter-house programme, but we will do him the justice
                        to say, that we believe it was without his knowledge or consent. He is an
                        independent man--disavows fidelity to all parties--never voted a full
                        Locofoco ticket in his life--never will, unless it just happens to please
                        him in detail. And he was taken as the candidate by the very wire-pullers
                        who slaughtered Secrist [sic], Brand, Everett, Fisher and others, because
                        they had not always voted the ticket blind! Gen. McAllen could vote just as
                        he pleased--could stand aloof from the party, and receive a two-thirds vote
                        for one of the most responsible and honorable positions to be filled; but
                        when Sellers was to be forced on the ticket over the wishes of the party,
                        his competitors were slaughtered without ceremony for every deviation from
                        strict party rules, however trivial! Consistency! what a jewel thou art!</p>
                    <p>The ballance [sic] of the ticket is fair, and will share the fate of the
                        party. If the Locofocos ever had a chance to make a fight for a portion of
                        their ticket they threw the opportuity [sic] from them on Convention day.
                        The slaughter-house managers will find when they go to the people that they
                        will spurn their dictation, and tell them to elect their ticket themselves.
                        The Locofoco leaders have slaughtered their party by their shameless
                        inconsistency and arrogant dictation; and the People will slaughter their
                        nominees in October next by the most decisive vote every given in the "Green
                        Spot!"</p>
