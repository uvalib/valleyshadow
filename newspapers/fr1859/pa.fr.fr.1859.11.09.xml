						Chambersburg, Pa. Gentlemen:--Please discontinue the paper sent to my
						address--as the time for which I have paid has expired, and recently I
						noticed a principle avowed--<emph rend="italic">in an
						editorial</emph>--which I think savours too much of the <emph rend="italic"
							>odious</emph> doctrine, of the "Dred Scott" decision. If my old friend
						A. N. Rankin has any curiosity to know to what I refer particularly, I will,
						when an opportunity offers, explain more fully, but I suppose my opinion or
						the loss of a subscriber, is of no importance. Hoping you will make further
						attainments in the cause of justice and humanity, and soon be willing to
						advocate the cause and contend for the rights of <emph rend="italic"
						>all</emph> without regard to color &amp;c. I remain yours, &amp;c.</p>
					<p>The "old friend," whose name is mentioned in the above communication, has
						great "curiosity to know" to what our correspondent refers. <emph
							rend="italic">He</emph> is the party who has given the offense
						complained of; for he alone discharges the duties of <emph rend="italic"
							>editing</emph> this paper, and he has written every <emph rend="italic"
							>leading</emph> editorial that has appeared in our columns for more than
						two years. He is altogether unable to understand what is meant by the soft
						impeachment. No Editor in the Union has more plainly denounced the "<emph
							rend="italic">odious</emph> doctrine of the 'Dred Scott' decision."
						Hoping to get an explanation, in due time, we say to our old friend--with
						the best of feelings--farewell.</p>

					<p>--According to its own showing the Administration certainly had ample warning
						of the outbreak at Harper's Ferry, two months beforehand. Even had the
						authenticity of the warning been doubted, it would have cost but little
						trouble to have quietly given notice to those in charge of the Armory at
						Harper's Ferry. Had such notice been given, who can believe that twenty-two
						men could have succeeded in taking a town of 3000 people, and Government
						work-shops containing 200 men with arms by their sides? That the
						Administration deliberately withheld this notice from the threatened
						community, looks very much as if it wanted the outbreak to occur, in order
						to manufacture political capital out of it. If it can be explained in a more
						creditable way, we trust the explanation will be forthcoming.</p>
					<p>Leading Republicans are freely accused by the Democratic press, although

					anything which has yet appeared.'"</excerpt>
				<transcript>
					<p>The Wheeling <emph rend="italic">Daily Intelligencer</emph>, published in the
						Dominion of Gov. Wise, contains the following rich correspondence on the
						late Harper's Ferry War. We hope, says the Harrisburg <emph rend="italic"
							>Telegraph</emph>, our friend of the <emph rend="italic">Patriot and
							Union</emph> will not fail to apprise his readers of the damnable plot
						existing between Giddings, Greely, &amp;c. That paper says:--"one of the
						reporters in New York says that he has now in his possession the following
						letters, which he regards as much more unequivocal proof of the complicity
						of Seward, Giddings, and other Republicans, in the Brown riot, than anything
						which has yet appeared. These letters were so deep down in one of the
						captured carpet bags, that it took some time before they could be reached.
						It will be seen that they are very incendiary in their nature:</p>
					<p>Egypt, 1859</p>
					<p>Dear Brown: I will try and be home in time for our little affair in Virginia.
						I propose bringing a company of Zouaves to assist us. Go on in you glorious
						work. I sent $2.</p>
					<p>Yours, W. H. Seward.</p>
					<p>Cleveland, 1859.</p>
					<p>Dear sir:--I will be at Harper's Ferry with 20,000 Republicans in time to
						carry out our plan. Senator Wade will shoot the President, and Grow will
						blow up the Capitol. It's all right. Mum's the word. Yours. J. R. G.</p>
					<p> Dear Brown: I will be on hand with Gov. Banks and the Massachusetts militia.
						Don't be frightened. I enclose $3. Horace G. says he won't fight, but sends
						a copy of the "<emph rend="italic">Tribune</emph>" gratis. On to victory!</p>
					<p>Yours, Wilson.</p>
					<p>The same reporter says that after the adjournment of a Democratic caucus at
						the Fifth Avenue Hotel, he happened in and found the following resolution
						which had been accidentally "laid on the table."</p>
					<p><emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph>, That, inasmuch as the great majority of
						the Democratic party are unable to read the newspapers, and utterly
						destitute of intellect sufficient to enable them to form an opinion on
						subjects of vital moment; and inasmuch as the late terrible insurrection at
						Harper's Ferry affords the most delightful stock of political capital, to
						which the Democratic party has fallen heir for many years past, it is deemed
						advisable to appoint a committee of highly respectable democrats to collect
						the facts (or all such as can, by any possibility, be made to redound to the
						glory of our beloved but decaying organization) in relation to the late
						dreadful revolution in Virginia, and to lay the same before the public at
						the earliest possible moment.</p>
