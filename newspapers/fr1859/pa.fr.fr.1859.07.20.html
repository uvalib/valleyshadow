                        loaded, it appears Mr. E. went immediately in front of the horse, when the
                        animal--which is some-what false--immediately reared up, and in coming down
                        his hoof struck Mr. E. in the face, thus inflicting the injury. He was taken

                        Band, took it into their heads to lull to sleep the representatives of the
                        Press of this place and, called around in front of the residence of some

                        music. No town in the State can boast of half as good a Band as ours.--The
                        young men composing this excellent musical corps are gentlemen, every one of
                        them. They have no bad habits, and are a credit to the town--long may they
                        wave.</p>
