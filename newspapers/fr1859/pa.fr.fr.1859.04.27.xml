                <excerpt>"A Virginia paper says that the portion ofthe Old Dominion called the
                    Panhandle is inhabited by abolitionists. If the abolitionists have got hold of
                    the handle of the pan, isn't there danger that they may upset the whole

                    </p>
                    <p>Mr. President:- I am glad to meet you- to join you upon an occasion so
                        interesting and important as the present one. I heartily endorse the
                        propriety of this convention. The base outrage recently attempted here by
                        the minions of despotic federal authority merits a stern rebuke, but not
                        more than the weakness and heartlessness which conceived and commanded it. I
                        love and admire the honesty and courage with which Gov. Packer has
                        appreciated and discharged all his public duties. To him and his able and
                        accomplished Attorney General and Secretary of the Commonwealth, are our
                        thanks eminently due for a manifestation of that devoted patriotism which
                        impelled them to consider their country first, and consequences afterwards.
                        It is no surprising that political prostitution should condemn it. The
                        popular affection, however, will be to them a shield more protective than
                        fortresses of granite and of iron. But I desire to speak of other matters.</p>
                    <p>At this day, resolutions complimentary to the present national administration
                        may be pardoned, when proceeding from official sycophants, but they can do
                        neither good no harm. The history of Mr. Buchanan's executive life has
                        already been written, and too plainly, to be obliterated by bribed eulogy,
                        or to be misunderstood by the people of this State and nation. Neither
                        political conjuration nor party magic can make them forget the wicked
                        violation of pledges, the arrogance of bloated power, the prostitution of
                        Congress, the profligacy of departments, or the rapid and marked
                        encroachments upon popular constitutional rights. Judgement, final
                        judgement, has been calmly and deliberately passed upon this treason to the
                        democracy, this assassination of common honesty, and it is as irreversable
                        as the decree of God. It is wise, therefore, in this convention, to speak
                        the truth plainly, and to avoid the folly of an attempt to cover up an
                        audacious criminality we must all condemn.</p>
                    <p>By the action of the 34th Congress, the complaints made by the residents of
                        Kansas were ascertained to be true. Although the South, by the legislation
                        of 1854, was pledged to maintain the domestic sovereighty of the
                        territories, a portion of their people from Missouri entered upon the soil
                        of Kansas, and, by force and fraud, seized the law making power, stilled the
                        voice of the majority, and enacted statutes disgraceful to the age and
                        nation. This fact, when legally revealed, made a deep impression upon the
                        public mind, and Mr. Buchanan found it necessary, in order to carry the
                        election in his own State, to pledge himself distinctly to the maintenance
                        of the doctrine of popular sovereignty, and to defend the rights of those
                        who had been thus ruthlessly despoiled. I will not pretend to indicate the
                        particular weakness in his nature that induced him to turn the hand of the
                        suicide against his own fame, as it matters little whether it arose from
                        timidity, a fear of his friends, a careless disregard of fair dealing, or a
                        weak and puerile vanity. It is enough to know that he deceived all our
                        hopes, turned with the blackest ingratitude upon that self-sacrificing
                        friendship by which he reached the goal of his feverish ambition, and sought
                        by all the means within the reach of drunken and staggering authority to
                        disgrace every man whom he could not debauch. Suddenly, and as by the touch
                        of the wand of the magician, he became transformed from the sympathizer with
                        down trodden freedom, to the open and shameless defender of aggressive and
                        law defying slavery.</p>
                    <p>The halls of the national legislature were turned into marts for conscience;
                        he published his interpretations of party principles and platforms with the
                        arrogance of a dictator; and commanded his subordinates in office, and his
                        coward slaves, to reiteratie and proclaim his bulls of party excommunication
                        against all who were rash enough to follow an independent judgment. These
                        acts of themselves are enough to sever allegiance. It would be an ill-shaped
                        manhood which could tolerate them in silence. But because we denounce them,
                        we are unathematised as rebellious. So, we will see where the rebellion will
                        end. It will end in the supremacy of the laws; in the integrity of the
                        constitution; in the purification of parties; in the sworn loyalty of
                        executives; and the vigorous growth, material greatness, and eternal
                        dominance of the North. That is where it will end. Popular sovereignty,
                        invoked by the South, will be defended by <emph rend="italic">us</emph>, and
                        it shall unfold the veiled yet dimly discovered destiny of this great
                        republic. We are battling for the right, for the spirit of the institutions
                        our fathers established; let us <emph rend="italic">feel</emph> that we are
                        doing this, and we will accomplish <emph rend="italic">the</emph> victory of
                        our century. Not a mere naked triumph at the polls, but the great success
                        afterwards -the untrammelled self-government of man; the dedication of a
                        continent to consistent liberty.</p>
                    <p>Those who stop to talk of conciliation and compromises between us and the
                        self-constituted oracles of the Democratic party, can have but a feeble
                        appreciation of the condition of things. When you can harmonize light and
                        darkness, integrity and corruption, the partiotic devotion of the private
                        citizen to the principles of our government, with a tyranny worse than that
                        of the middle ages, it will be time enough to cry "peace." Let this truth be
                        made prominent -that there is an eternal antagonism between <emph
                            rend="italic">freedom</emph> and <emph rend="italic"
                        >slavery</emph>.--The constitution of the human mind and the human heart
                        makes it inevitable; and the one or the other must eventually gain the
                        ascendancy. The struggle between them, but just begun, is now going on in
                        our midst, and he is but a superficial observer who does not discover it. We
                        have acted honorably -benevolenty. <emph rend="italic">For long, long years
                            we have defended the chartered rights of our Southern brethren; we have
                            even conceded their exactions; we have given them all the advantages
                            springing from</emph><emph rend="bold"> unequal legislation</emph>;
                            <emph rend="italic">we have</emph> CHANGED POLICY<emph rend="italic"> to
                            suit their notions of interest;</emph> until having grown fat, they
                        demand as a <emph rend="italic">prerogative</emph> what we granted as a
                            <emph rend="italic">favor</emph>, and having found a President without
                        affections, a sworn officer not afraid of perjury, willing to back their
                        pretensions, they would now treat us as a <emph rend="italic">common enemy,
                            and brand our names with indellible infamy.</emph> They have done more
                        -they have gone farther; <emph rend="italic">they have come amongst us, and
                            bribed cupidity with gold, ambition with promotion, and vanity with
                            temporary consequence, to do violence to justice.</emph> Longer
                        forbearance not only ceases to be virtuous, but it becomes <emph
                            rend="italic">cowardly and base.</emph> The North has rights, long in
                        abeyance truly, yet not lost;<emph rend="italic"> we will save them; by
                            walls of fire and blood, if needs be, we will save them.</emph></p>
                    <p>In what I have just said, I would not be misunderstood; I know I cannot
                        escape misrepresentation. I would resist aggression on the part of the
                        South, not her constitutional guarantees; and I would force a plain,
                        distinct, unequivocal recognition of the rightful claims of the North;
                        nothing more, nothing less. Who can safely complain of this?</p>
                    <p>I wish I could stop here. If this were all of the accusation, we might forget
                        the past in the exercise of a profuse charity, but unfortunately, we are not
                        allowed to do so. A usurpation has been accomplished which saps the very
                        foundation of our political structure. Mr. Buchanan has demanded an
                        absorption of the powers of Congress in those of the Executive. To carry out
                        his treachery to us, he has assailed the representatives of the people. He
                        has bribed the venal, rewarded the aspiring, alarmed the timid, and deceived
                        the honest. By such means was the Lecompton Constitution carried into a
                        provisional law, in contemptuous disregard of the known will of the people
                        upon whom it was imposed, and in direct contravention of the letter and
                        spirit of the organic act itself. The reason which prompted the commission
                        of the outrage is too manifest to be doubted. It was to purchase flattery of
                        the South; to force slavery upon the soil of the North; and to strengthen
                        and aggrandise one section of the Union at the expense and hazard of the
                        other. Then, compliance with the executive behests was the est of the
                        democracy, and to disregard them was tapostacy.</p>
                    <p>More recently, however, when the recommedations of the President were thought
                        to favor the manufacturing and agricultural States -when the propriey of a
                        new tariff law was suggested- and when the so-called Democratic members of
                        the Senate and House of Representatives, and even Cabinet Officers, raised
                        the voice of denunciatory opposition, it was all right, and rebellion became
                        loyalty. And yet Pennsylvanians see nothing wrong in this; nay, they commend
                        it. Chains never clanked upon the limbs of beings more servile and debased.
                        We might, perhaps, be able to open their eyes to the truth, and loosen their
                        tongues to utter it, by continuing them in office under a new administration
                        governed by a more benign policy. If parties with such plastic notions,
                        shall be able to grasp the control of our government, then must the strong
                        empire of the North be dwarfed to barrenness, and eighteen millions of white
                        slaves here, be added to the four millions of black slaves yonder. This is
                        indeed a stange illustration of the advantages of free government which
                        proclaims a necessity for crushing out the inherent power of a people by
                        fashioning their institutions for them requiring it to be sanctioned, and
                        yet allows and encourages a denial of law by which alone a bankrupt treasury
                        can be replenished, and honest debts paid.</p>
                    <p>But, sir, we charge further upon the administration of Mr. Buchanan one of
                        the main causes by which we have reached the point of national insolvency, a
                        reckless prodigality in the expenditures of the public money, and a
                        previling vice in the departments of the government. It is a gross mistake
                        to suppose that our increased expenses are owing to an expansion of
                        territory and the removal of our frontier. The administration of Mr. Van
                        Buren, with an annual outlay of thiry-seven millions of dollars, was
                        pronounced extravagant; now our expenses are close upon one hundred millions
                        a year. But we have got used to talking of millions without stopping to
                        consider the magnitude of the figures.--Why, sir, all the horses and mules
                        in this county, numbering over six thousand, would scarcely draw, in silver,
                        the money required to foot our government bills for a single year. Do you
                        enquire why this is so? I will tell you. We have abandoned our former and
                        better practices. When Mr. Jefferson was President, he required honesty and
                        capability in his appointees; now, subordinates are selected for their known
                        lack of independence, conscience and will. There was a time, which our
                        fathers remember, when to be the head of a department, a Secretary of
                        Treasury or of War, or of the Navy, require greatness, and inspired
                        confidence; now a man of very moderate dimensions will suffice for either
                        place. An ex-Governor or effete Senator will always answer for the position,
                        provided he has the marks of gyves upon his legs and does not know too much.
                        I think we will be able to furnish one hereafter who may claim by a double
                        title. I hazard little in saying there is now more money squandered and
                        stolen yearly, than it required during the administrations of Madison,
                        Monroe, and the younger Adams, to support the government.</p>
                    <p>There is not only no careful supervision of our finances, but funds are
                        drawn, constantly, directly from your treasury to rewared favorits, and to
                        give approved shape to public opinion at the polls; in other words, to cary
                        elections. The Secretary of the Navy, among others, may know something of
                        this. If he should not, the Patterson letter, with the President's
                        endorsement, may afford him information. Public property, of great value, is
                        sold, privately and covertly, at a tithe of its worth; other is brought at
                        almost fabulous prices. Navy Yards, Post Offices, Custom Houses and Mints,
                        have been stocked, crowded crammed, for weeks and months, with superannuates
                        and idlers, and paid the wages only due to well taught craft and deserving
                        industry, for the mere purpose of overriding the legal voters, returning
                        parasites, tumbler and trencher friends, to Congress, and publishing an
                        attested lie to the world. These acts- these flagrant violations of
                        preservative law and decent behavior- have all been endorsed here, in this
                        place, in this Capitol, and uttered and published as true and genuine
                        Democracy. God save the Republic! And knowing them all, and in the face of
                        them all, the President himself, to whom but three short years ago we gave
                        the fullness of our confidence, now bleached by age, and blanching before
                        the frowns of an outraged and insulted constituency, cants and whines, in
                        hypocritical numbers, over the degeneracy of the times, and in the
                        expression of a fear lest elections should be carried by gold. Catching the
                        sounds of lamentation as they issue from the open casements and portals of
                        the White House, your Biglers, <emph rend="italic">et id omne genus,</emph>
                        move with the hushed and solemn tread of mourners, and shed gouty tears of
                        blood.</p>
                    <p>The indefensible and destructive management of the Post Office Department,
                        requires especially to be noticed. Within a very short period, for the mere
                        purposes of enriching contractors, bestowing largesses upon sterile and
                        uninhabited districts of the South, and acquiring power, the expenditures
                        have been almost double -run up to the enormous sum of twenty milions of
                        dollars- and the mail system made a by-word and a reproach.--With new,
                        extended, and expensive routes, without corresponding returns, sunk in
                        fathomless debt, aye, paralised by burthens, its chief lustily cries for
                        help and piteously begs the sinew of prolonged malfeasance. But upon whom
                        does he call? Upon those to whom the appeal is always made when money,
                        votes, soldires, or other effective help is required -upon the laboring,
                        thrifty- the "mud sills" of Eastern, Northern, Middle and Western States. It
                        is consoling to know we are good enough to pay, if not to receive. We are at
                        least able, if not respectable. If we have not chivalry, we have fields, and
                        farms and factories. Let us then, without whimpering, "split the
                        difference." The "F.F. V's" or the "F.F.T's" shall take all the posts of
                        patronage, and we will pay their debts. The plan proposed, by which we shall
                        do this, is a very simple one. We have only to pay five cents, instead of
                        three, on each letter we write, abolish the present "franking privilege,"
                        and, consequently, cut off the distribution of all seeds and agricultural
                        and mechanical and political information from our people, and the thing is,
                        in a great measure, accomplished. And why not do this? To be sure <emph
                            rend="italic">we</emph> more than pay <emph rend="italic">now</emph> for
                        all <emph rend="italic">our</emph> postal service, and these documents are
                        highly prized by us, but do we not know that "<emph rend="italic">the</emph>
                        domestic institution" is too poor to pay, and too ignorant to read. We seem
                        to be prone eternally to forget that we were mad for hewers of wood and
                        drawers of water. If we would remember this fact. I think we could cordially
                        unite with those who met here on the 16th ult., and join them in paeans and
                        praise to the new American Monarchy.</p>
                    <p>It has become humiliating to pride to speak the truth, for it has become
                        unfashionable, and almost incredible. Largely in debt, pressed on all sides
                        by voracious creditors, with no present ability to pay, and with constantly
                        accumulating liabilities, the President of the United States has shown
                        himself incompetent to carry any measure of relief. Yes, this man and his
                        Cabinet are appalled, terror stricken, and motionless in view of the natural
                        results of their own policy. If it were permissable, I would recommend them
                        to infuse a little of their Lecompton fire into the tariff recommendation--</p>
                    <p>"Instead of standing, staring altogether,</p>
                    <p>Like garden gods -and not so decent either."</p>
                    <p>To blind our sight to its short comings, to cover up its disgraceful defeats,
                        and to reconstruct its sinking fortunes, the administration now proposes, by
                        virtue of a transfer of the war-making power to itself, to visit
                        chastisement upon feeble states for imaginary wrongs, and by the acquisition
                        of Cuba to extend the area of freedom gluttonized on slavery. A man self
                        made mad, and then self destroyed -A Lear in rages, and not in robes- having
                        lost the sceptre by the weakness of folly, clutches the flying air, and
                        seeks to mount again to power and influence. Vanity of vanities! there is no
                        restitution for fallen greatness.</p>
                    <p>A few material inquiries may possibly present themselves, when we come to
                        consider the propriety of the purchase of the vain and much praised "Queen
                        of the Antilles," and of bringing her into our loving and lecherous embrace.
                        In what way, by what mysterious means, with what magic key will you draw the
                        thirty golden millions, demanded by the President as earnest money, and the
                        hundreds of millions afterwards, from a strong box, empty as the heart of
                        its keeper, and which is more secure in locking treasure out than locking it
                        in? How far will a well regulated prudence determine us to go in entrusting
                        such vast amounts in the hands of one who has already deceived us -in whom
                        we have no confidence? By what legal secret will we be able to consummate a
                        purchase of Spain, who has determined not to sell? And how can we better
                        secure ourselves against those who, in league with the President, have
                        sought to humiliate us, by giving them the control of the Gulf of Mexico as
                        they may have it over the Mississippi?</p>
                    <p>I think I can school myself to love my enemies; but not better than myself. I
                        can willingly admit my brother to an equal enjoyment of a common
                        inheritance; but I cannot, when he does me violence and injustice,
                        strengthen his arm so as to enable him forcibly to take it all. So, I can
                        and will love my Southern neighbor. I will freely allow him an equal
                        participation of all the fruits of our generous system. I will divide with
                        him the temple of Liberty. I will shield him from the evil doer. But when he
                        denies to me what I am willing to grant to him, and that which my title
                        covers, I will not stultify myself and place weapons in his hand for my
                        destruction; and I will never pay tribute for either his kindness or
                        forbearance. Cuba may be important to the Union; I will admit that it will
                        be so when we have just and equal laws, and honest officer; but before we
                        acquire it, I desire to be informed whether any legislation can possibly be
                        had as beneficial to Pennsylvania as the purchase would be to Tennessee of
                        Georgia; and above all shall I seek to know how, thenceforward, we are to be
                        treated. For if I am a traitor, an unconscious and unrewarded one, to either
                        thirty-three or fifteen states I will not add to the enormity of my offence
                        by extending the number of States against which my guilt must operate.</p>
                    <p>I have stated as concisely as I could, my judgement of the management of the
                        government for the last two years. I trust I have made it plain and
                        distinct. I have not descended to minute particulars; the proof of my
                        declarations having become matter of enduring record has rendered it
                        unneccessary to do so. I leave it before you and the country, as a full
                        justification for our present course, and as the reason for our settled
                        determination to refuse to be indentified with movements we both deplore and
                        despise. Desiring to be fair, we cannot tolerate deception. Sustaining
                        right, we must denounce usurpation. Asking justice, we cannot inflict a
                        wrong. Economy is not presented to us as a choice, it is force upon us as a
                        necessity; and having been trained in a system of politics that we love, and
                        taught to regard purity as essential to power, it is too late in our lives
                        to turn demagogues to maintain majorities, or to barter for smiles from
                        rotten rule. It is true that renewed and continues denunciation and
                        proscription are likely to be our reward for the choice we make, but I
                        cannot avoid hinting to those who suppose they have throttled the wolf, that
                        may have only caught him by the ears.</p>
                    <p>It is told when the Belvidere Apollo was in the Louvre, a ray of gushing and
                        fascinating beauty came with each returning sun to look upon and love it,
                        wreathing it with selected flowers, and clasping it in all the ardor of her
                        youthful heart. Days and weeks and months rolled on, until at last the cold
                        and stony figure turned her warm blood to ice, and she was found dead, with
                        her face buried in her hand, and leaning against it. Sir, <emph
                            rend="italic">we</emph> may be too ideal, and look for a perfection
                        which nature does not furnish. Like the daughter of the Baron, we may bestow
                        the jewels of the heart where their value can never be appreciated, and our
                        last pulse may beat as we kneel in absorbing and silent adoration before the
                        symbol of a god. If such must be, we may well claim, at least, a generous
                        sympathy, for that form once had brain, and heart, and life and power. In
                        the days of Jefferson it was wise and creative; in the days of Madison brave
                        and benevolent, and in the days of Jackson commanding and resistless. then
                        it was the awe inspiring guardian of Liberty -American Democracy- inviting
                        championship, and holding in its hands the olive branch of peace and the
                        thunderbolt of war.</p>
                    <p>But, sir, we will not die, but live. We have Aristotle's hope the dreams of
                        waking men and their appaling interpretations shall be written out in
                        letters of fire upon walls of adamant. It shall be read of all men, from the
                        Aroostook to the Golden Gate. You have it -truth in a whisper shall confound
                        the lie from a trumpet; and a naked child shall tread upon the armored giant
                        leading the hosts marshalled against the advancing civilization and
                        righteous government of man.</p>
                    <p>Look not back, we have learned the past but onward, onward, with steady eye
                        and unwavering step. The goal is <emph rend="italic">before</emph> you! You
                        will remember then when Orpheus lost Eurydice, he followed her even into the
                        abode of Hades, where by the power of his lyre he won her back, but it was
                        enjoined upon him that he should not look upon her until he had arrived in
                        the upper air. At the very moment they were passing the fatal bounds, it is
                        said his love overcame him, and looking around to know that she was
                        following him, she was caught back into the infernal regions: The story
                        embodies a pregnant moral. If you would regain the loved and the lost, then
                        forward! forward!!</p>
                    <p>I am done. If I have been dull, you will pardon me. If I have inspired a
                        single patriotic thought or feeling, I have my reward.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>Last week we gave an extract from the Charleston (S.C.) <emph rend="italic"
                            >Mercury,</emph> which entirely ignores the claims of Northern
                        sycophantic Locofocos to <emph rend="italic">Nationalism</emph> (?) and
                        fraternity with their Southern masters.--That paper speaks out boldly,
                        declaring <emph rend="italic">all</emph>, except Southerners, without the
                        pale of the <emph rend="italic">great National Democratic
                        party</emph>.--This is almost too bad. The dough-faces of the North have,
                        for years, been stooping to every kind of debasement to propitiate the
                        good-will of these petty tyrants -picayune monarchs- of slavedom; and now,
                        after the people in the North have nearly everywhere repudiated them for
                        their truckling meanness, for the nabobs of the South, in whose behalf they
                        have sacrificed so much, to turn their backs up on them also, is the very
                        height of ingratitude.</p>
                    <p>The base subserviency to Southern dictation which has hitherto characterized
                        the movements of Nothern locofocos, in order to curry favor with their
                        allies of the South, has long been a matter of astonishment to outsiders.
                        How thirteen millions of white men, living in and breathing the air of the
                        free North, could voluntarily submit to be brow-beaten into supporting any
                        measure they knew to be wrong, or be compelled to denounce principles of
                        eternal justice and truth, -for condemning which, their consciences smote
                        them- at the command of a handful (less than the half of one million) of
                        Southern slave holders, has been a fruitful source of amazement to every
                        person not bound by the independence-destroying rules of a tyranizing party.
                        Many of the people, and a few of the leaders of the locofoco party in the
                        North are beginning to get their eyes open to the disreputable condition to
                        which they have been reduced by the ever-exacting, never-satisfied
                        oligarchy.</p>
                    <p>Doubtless many members of the liberty crushing party were no little astounded
                        by the announcement of the Charleston <emph rend="italic">Mercury</emph>;
                        but what do they think of the following from another Southern locofoco:</p>
                    <p>"It is not enough that they (the Northern democracy) should sanction slavery
                        in its <emph rend="italic">most objectionable aspect, by aiding in the
                            recapture of the fugitive negro</emph> -it is not enough that they
                        should <emph rend="italic">admit slavery into the Territories under cover of
                            the Constitution</emph>-it is not enough that they should consent to
                            <emph rend="italic">reverse the traditionary policy of the Government
                            and to accept the illimitable extension of Southern institutions</emph>-
                        it is not enough that they should <emph rend="italic">fetter the arm of
                            Congress, hitherto so active and efficient in the restriction of
                            slavery, </emph>and wake the dormant energies of the judiciary for its
                        protection in the Federal domain -all these the Northern Democracy have
                        yielded; <emph rend="italic">but their Southern associates are not yet
                            content.</emph> They must agree to employ the power of Government for
                        the propagation of slavery. It is a condition they can not accept."</p>
                    <p>What a humiliating picture of their own hitherto uniform practices for free
                        men to behold, and for others to view as the line of conduct pursued by the
                        party which claims to possess all the <emph rend="italic">democracy</emph>
                        in the land. All the imperious exactions which the privileged few saw fit to
                        make at the hands of the time serving locofoco party have been readily
                        granted. From gaining one unrighteous demand they (the power grasping
                        lords-of-the lash) hastened to require larger concessions from those who
                        were constantly disgracing themselves in the eyes of all honorable men, for
                        granting any of the wicked claims of the South; for the haughty arrogance
                        was but fattening on that upon which it fed. The opposition have for a great
                        while charged home upon the truckling party of the North the very conduct
                        which the Washington <emph rend="italic">States</emph> now candidly admits
                        to have been their policy; yet they invariably denied the "soft
                        impeachment," and declared themselves to be opposed to forcing slavery into
                        the territories "under cover of the constitution;" opposed to granting any
                        greater or larger favors to one portion of the country than the other, and
                        declared that their motto was "equal and exact justice to all." Now,
                        however, the truth of the case is made to appear by a competent witness
                        taking the stand, and we find, to our satisfaction and their chagrin, that
                        the allegations we made against the lackey democracy are fully
                        substanciated. We may well ask, what next?</p>
                    <p>After fettering the strong arm of Congress so as to prevent its interference
                        to restrict the illimitable spread of the gangrened ulcer on our body
                        politic, the pliable democracy of the North then proceeded to wake up the
                        sleeping powers of the judiciary, and compelled grey headed Judges to trail
                        the ermine of their official station in the dust of political filth; decend
                        from the proud and noble position of enders of truth and justice, and become
                        decruel champions of oppression and wrong. There is not another body of men
                        to be found in the known world who can be prevailed upon to stultify
                        themselves without receiving any return; their own consciences also
                        condemning them, and all high-minded men loudly rebuking them for their
                        puerility. The American Judiciary once occupied an exalted position in the
                        opinion of the enlightened world; now, however, it is becoming a byword of
                        derision and scorn. The Marshals, the Jays, the Storys and the Gibsons have
                        all taken their departure from the scenes of earth, and the places which
                        once were occupied by those giant intellects are now filled by dwarfed
                        pigmies.</p>
                    <p>The horrible dogma uttered by Roger B. Taney, that "negroes have no rights
                        which white men are bound to respect," seems to pervade our whole judicial
                        system. Had that monstrous doctrine never been pronounced, by the Chief
                        Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, as a part of the genius
                        of our laws, no such hellish sentiment would ever have proceeded from Judge
                        Crawford, (a native of this town, to our shame be it said) as that which he
                        declared recently to be the law of the land, i.e. that slaves cannot
                        contract marriage and, therefore, cannot commit adultery. Another just
                        reason for the interrogatory, what next?</p>
                    <p>Can these things last forever? Will cruelty, oppression and wrong, ever hold
                        the ascendency in the Republican America? Well did Jefferson say:--"I
                        tremble for my country when I remember that God is just." A day of
                        retribution is hastening on. The Egyptians thought that the God of Moses was
                        not able to deliver the Israelites out of their hands, and they tightened
                        their hold upon them, instead of hearkening to his appeals for their
                        liberation. The deliverance, came, however, and with it a fearful reckoning
                        to their taskmasters. May we not profit by this Bible lesson?</p>

                <summary>Story condemns the "sycophantic" Northern doughfaces (Northern Democrats)
                    in their devotion to the Southern cause. It especially attacks the Southern
                    Democrats' claims to "nationalism," while reserving power in the party for
                    Southerners alone. The Democracy has brought the once-revered American judiciary
                    low into "the dust of political filth." The author concludes by declaring that
                    God will someday punish America for its "cruelty, oppression and wrong."</summary>
