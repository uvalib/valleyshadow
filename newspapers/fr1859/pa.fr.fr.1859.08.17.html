                        to my helpless elbow? Can I go to see anything pleasant, like an execution or a dissection? Can I drive that
                        splendid "Lantern," distancing -- like his owner -- all competitors? Can I
                        have the nomination for "Governor of Vermont," like our other contributor,

<b>Out of all Character</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A complaint about a "ragged, dilapidated, worn-out" section of sidewalk on
                    North Main Street in Chambersburg.<br>
</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We have frequently referred, with pride and pleasure, to the spirit of
                        improvement which has so generally taken possession of the citizens of this
                        town, and vicinity; but there is one portion of the town which is a disgrace
                        to any civilized community -- we mean the ragged, dilapidated, worn-out
                        board-walk beyond the Bridge on North Main street. Whose fault is it that
                        this unsafe, unsightly foot-walk continues to annoy all who are compelled to
                        use the dangerous pathway? Let us have the name of the man, or names of the
                        men, who refuse or neglect to repair this much used pavement, and we will
                        put them upon record for future reference -- hand them down to succeeding
                        generations as public spirted (?) [sic] individuals. Last Sabbath, going to
                        and, returning from church, we saw a number of Ladies going into the street
                        for safe walking -- afraid to trust themselves upon the foot-trap. If it is
                        the fault of the Council, we will hoist each member of the board in bold
                        type by way of perpetuating their memory. Something must be done, and that
                        pretty soon, to make this side-walk safe; or the town may have a nice little
                        bill of damages to pay. The gentleman living on this side of the Bridge was
                        compelled to pave the entire length of his lot, from King street to the
                        Bridge; then why cannot the owners of the other side be made subject to the
                        same Ordinance, that governed the case when this side of the Bridge needed
                        paving. Attend to this matter Messrs. Councilmen and save your credit.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Wednesday of last week a lad about 12 years of age, son of Mr. LEONARD
                        NAVE, near Culbertson's Row, a few miles North of this place, went into
                        Nickle's Mill dam to bathe, and, not being able to swim ventured into water
                        too deep for him to wade out of and, before assistance could reach the
                        unfortunate boy he was drowned. A son of M. NICKLE performed a daring feat
                        in recovering the body of the dead boy. He clung to the side of a boat,
                        propelled by others in the boat, with his body under water, feeling with his
                        feet for the body, as the boat was rowed through the dam, till he succeeded
                        in touching the object of his search with his feet, when he dived down and
                        brought it to the surface. The mourning relatives, and the whole community,
                        feel deeply grateful to this brave youth for his successful efforts in
                        rescuing the body. It is greatly regretted that he, the intrepid young man,
                        was not within calling distance to save the life of the unfortunate boy --
                        his little neighbor.</p>

                        nominal bail of one hundred dollars each, and go bail for each other. Col.

                        to take place without interposing a solitary objection. He would not add
