<b>Col. Baldwin's Speech Concluded</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In the conclusion to his speech to the Convention, Col. Baldwin continued
                    to insist that the divisive issues threatening disunion hinge on the slavery
                    question. Col. Baldwin asserted that the Federal government has thus far made no
                    attempts to thwart the practice of slavery that didn't receive the approval of
                    Virginia. As to the question of slavery in the territories, Baldwin pointed out
                    that the Territories are not suited to slavery and therefore this question is
                    unnecessarily divisive.<br>(Names in announcement: Col.  Baldwin)</blockquote>

                    States do not share, being disproportionately affected by such problems as
                    fugitive slaves and the threat of war with the North.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Having steadfastly adhered to the doctrine that civil war, or danger of
                        constant collision between the Border, Free and Slave States, could only be
                        averted by a peaceful settlement in the Union of
                        our present troubles, and that it was really the interest of the Border
                        Slave States to maintain their present relations with the Free States on our
                        border, and with the whole Union if possible, we have deduced therefrom a
                        difference between our condition and that of the Gulf States. Nothing that
                        has occurred, therefore, has served to change or even shake the conviction,
                        that we have interests in the Union that are paramount--interests that the
                        Cotton States have not; and that therefore we should not rashly imperil them
                        through any fancied identity of interest with the States that have left us
                        for weal or for woe, to work out our own destiny as best we may. We have
                        maintained that it is neither our interest to go with them, nor really
                        essential to our interest that we should. We are glad, therefore, to find so
                        respectable a journal in one of the seceded States, as the Milledgeville
                        (Geo.) Recorder, supporting the views we have
                        advocated. In the issue of that journal of the 12th inst., we find the case
                        thus strongly stated, as follows: "If the line of the Southern Confederacy
                        touched that of the Free States, there being to law or treaty for the
                        rendition of fugitives from labor between foreign
                        Powers, the mischief would be such, practically, that a collision of
                        arms would be unavoidable, unless the Slave States receded altogether from
                        the claims on which they insisted while in the Union, of having their
                        property returned to them under the plain behest of the Constitution and the
                        acts of Congress to carry it into effect. In the simple matter of
                        convenience and expediency, therefore, we believe that the Border States
                        will be of more advantage in their present position to the Southern
                        Confederacy, a wall of defence against Northern aggression, than if they
                        were to become members of it, with all their frontier exposed to fanatical
                        hatred and pillage. We should then have to try an experiment which otherwise
                        we might be under the necessity of making with the Free States, and which no
                        amount of wisdom or valor may contemplate with indifference. If slaves from
                        the Border States are stolen or enticed away by the abolitionists, the game
                        would become vastly interesting in the absence of any stipulations
                        recognizing slaves as property, which we have
                        reason to believe could never be obtained. Outrage would follow outrage in
                        rapid succession, and on a scale of such magnitude that war would be the
                        only mode of redress." </p>
                    <p>Ought not this candid avowal, from a source entitled to credit, induce the
                        people of the Border Slave States to make every effort compatible with their honor (and we would not have them do more)
                        to avert the catastrophe, before they rush into the vortex of secession?
                        This word, with us, has a deeper signification than it can have in the Gulf
                        States. We trust our people will do nothing rashly. </p>

                    mere dim prospect causes a fifty percent increase.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On the 31st of January last, the Auditor of public Accounts reported that the
                        present rate of taxation, which is forty cents on the hundred dollars' value
                        of property, would yield a surplus of $225,884.57 per annum, which, if
                        applied to the temporary debt created for the defence of the State, would,
                        in less than five years, discharge it. This estimate of that officer was
                        made upon the supposition that the annual increase in the value of property, as a basis and subject of
                        taxation, would, during that period, equal the temporary decrease caused by our national difficulties. But the agitation
                        of the question of secession, and the uncertainty in which the fate of the
                        State has been and is still kept, has had the effect to decrease the value of property, and to increase the expenses of the State to such an extent, that the
                        same officer reported on the 22nd of March that the rate of taxation should
                        be increased the present year to a sum at least
                        equal to sixty cents on every hundred dollars'
                        value of property, and on every subject in the same proportion. This is an
                        increase of fifty per cent. in our taxation. The
                        people may well "groan, groan, GROAN," when they
                        reflect that their taxes are to be increased fifty per cent., whilst their ability to pay has been diminished to
                        an even greater degree. They will not have as much money to pay with, and
                        will have fifty per cent. more to pay. When the
                        people estimate what they have lost by the depreciation in the value of
                        their property, and by the increase of their taxes, they will be able to
                        form some idea of the cost to them of the agitation of the question of
                        secession. They will then begin to realize the truth of what we have
                        frequently told them--that secession, yea, even the contemplation of it,
                        implies increased taxation. If the mere dim
                        prospect and distant probability of secession, which at present exists,
                        causes an increase of fifty per cent. in
                        taxation, what would be the increase of taxation if the hopes of the
                        secessionists should be realized?--"Worm-wood and gall" are sweet when
                        compared with the bitterness of the fruits of secession. </p>
