<b>Speech of Hon. John T. Harris of Virginia in the House of Representatives,
                    Feb. 6, 1861</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Mr. Harris advocates staying in the Union, despite the injuries that the
                    South has received. He believes that a war would be fatal and that for a redress
                    of grievances the South should seek a diplomatic solution with those sections of
                    the North that have abused their rights. He argues that existing as separate and
                    hostile nations would cause more problems than already exist and war would not
                    permanently be averted. He also believes that war would disproportionately
                    damage the Border States.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Letter to the Editor praises Augusta County for her dedication to the Union
                    as evinced by her selection of Unionists for the convention by a vast majority.
                    The writer also praises Hugh Sheffey's selflessness in dropping out of the
                    election for fear of splitting the Union ticket.<br>(Names in announcement:  Hugh Sheffey)</blockquote>

<b>The Allies of Black Republicans</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Rejects the contention that all Union men are Black Republicans. The
                    article states that secessionists make this slanderous charge in order to
                    increase the resolve of Black Republicans, who may be apt to think they have
                    allies in the South. The Republicans thus may be less willing to compromise with
                    the South.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Spectator notes that the New York Times, a Republican journal,
                    recognizes the Southern Unionists as a group that can help avert war and be a
                    conduit for compromise.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>New York Times</blockquote>
<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Enquirer defends Gen. Winfield Scott against charges that he wishes to
                    coerce seceding states to remain in the Union. He argues that a civil war is a
                    terrible calamity and that "disunion is a smaller evil" than war.<br>

<b>Henry Clay on Secession</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Excerpt from an 1851 letter written by Henry Clay to Daniel Ulman that
                    denies the right of secession.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Buchanan, Cass, and Republican Government</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article cites a piece from the Richmond Dispatch claiming that the
                    "selfish and unholy ambition of politicians" rather than slavery is dragging the
                    country to ruin.<br>

<blockquote>
<b>The Reason for the Change</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Notes that, before the Convention election, the secessionists were calling
                    Union men submissionists and Black Republicans. However, now that the people
                    have spoken in favor of the Union, the few secessionists who were elected are
                    scrambling for offices at the Convention and have thus stricken such divisive
                    language from their vocabulary.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The Late Election</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Praises the seriousness with which the elections were taken by the people
                    and notes with pride that people put the cause of Union ahead of partisan or
                    personal concerns.<br>
