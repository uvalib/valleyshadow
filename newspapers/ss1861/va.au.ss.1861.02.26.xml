                <head>Equal Taxation--Let Justice Be Done</head>
                <origin/>
                <commentary/>
                <excerpt/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>It will be seen by reference to the proceedings of the Convention on
                        Thursday, that Ex-Gov. Wise said that the resolutions offered by Mr. Woods,
                        of Barbour, justified the course which he and four other Eastern members
                        pursued in the Convention in 1850, when they contended for equal taxation
                        and equal representation for the West and East. If justice to Western
                        Virginia demanded, as it certainly did, equality of taxation in 1850,
                        justice demands the same in 1861. It remains to be seen whether Mr. Wise
                        will endeavor, in the present Convention, to have justice done to Western
                        Virginia in respect to taxation. Since 1850, the State has been taxed to a
                        very large amount for the purpose of protecting the property of the East.
                        There are, if possible, <emph rend="italic">stronger</emph> reasons for
                        equalizing taxation now than in 1850. No people, we venture to say, have
                        ever submitted with equal patience to such palpable injustice as the people
                        of Western Virginia have done. We hope thrt this Convention will do justice
                        to the Western portion of the State. The people of the West should <emph
                            rend="italic">demand</emph> justice at the hands of this Convention.
                            <emph rend="italic">Fiat justitia, ruat calum</emph>.--Let justice be
                        done though the heavens fall.</p>
