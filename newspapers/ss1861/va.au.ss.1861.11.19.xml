                    <p>There seems to be a general preference, says the <emph rend="italic"
                            >Examiner,</emph> on the part of the States of the Confederacy to
                        prevent the Confederate tax gatherers from making their appearance among
                        them, when they can save ten per centum upon the whole sum by collecting it
                        under State authority, and paying it into the Confederate treasury. It
                        certainly seems to be more satisfactory that the people should be visited by
                        the tax collectors of but one Government, provided the system of State
                        taxation is not objectionable on the ground of inequality. </p>
                    <p>It is to be noticed, however, that Congress has not apportioned the sum to be
                        raised among the States without the intervention of Confederate Assessors.
                        In the act of Congress provision is made for the appointment of assessors by
                        the Confederate Government, and the valuation of taxable property in each
                        State. It would seem, therefore, that there is no way of ascertaining the
                        amount which each State is required to pay till this assessment is made.</p>
