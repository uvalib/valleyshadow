<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The outrages committed in the Northern States in the violent efforts to
                        suppress any expressions of sentiments in the opposition to the tyranny of
                        Lincolnism, by the demolition of such presses as know their rights and dare
                        to maintain them, furnish the most conclusive evidence that there is a
                        feeling of opposition to the farther prosecution of Lincoln's unholy war
                        pervading the masses of the people of that section which inspires as much
                        dread in the minds of the tyrants at Washington as the masked batteries of
                        the "rebels," the very thought of which makes their knees knock together
                        with more violence than did those of Balthazzar when he read his doom in the
                        mystic handwriting on the wall. They tyrants know that the rights of the
                        people have been ruthlessly violated, that the constitution has been
                        trampled underfoot, that the most sacred bulwarks of freedom have been
                        destroyed, and that they would be justified in rising in the majesty of
                        their strength that they might crush the tyrants who would enslave them, and
                        consequently they fear and tremble and very properly deem their only means
                        of safety consists in a wanton and destruction of such presses as persist in
                        remaining true to the sacred rights of the people. The freedom of speech and
                        the freedom of the press must be destroyed, else the masses of the outraged
                        people will rise in mutiny. The tyrants feel that they are standing upon the
                        crust of a volcano through which the compressed fires of freedom may any day
                        burst forth, and involve them all in total and irrevocable ruin. It is not
                        the presses they dread, so much as it is the response with which their free
                        expressions meet in the hearts of the masses of the people. If the
                        sentiments of these presses did not find an echo in the hearts of the people
                        they would remain unmolested. The fact that they have destroyed such presses
                        as oppose their policy, furnishes conclusive evidence that they are
                        conscious their policy will not bear the test of criticism. They,
                        themselves, affix the brand of conviction of wrong-doing upon their own
                        brows--by their own conduct they stand self-condemned in the pillory of
                        public opinion.</p>

                        abolitiondom is short and the coast clear, and the man who is not loyal to
                        the Southern Confederacy has no business in it. This is no time to harbor
                        the disaffected, every one of whom has it in his power to do mischief by
                        acting the spy. All may not do it, but all have it in their power, and
                        should, therefore, be removed beyond our limits. Ours should be a harmonious

                    that appointments are heaped upon the already titled and wealthy of Augusta.<br>(Names in announcement: Col. John Baldwin,  Michael Harman, Major  Ross)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Some Rockbridge man, under the signature of "Phil," in the last Lexington
                        Gazette, in a vein of facetiousness, complains that justice has not been
                        done Rockbridge county in the appointment of field officers of the 52d
                        Regiment, to which that county has furnished three companies. He complains
                        that Augusta county is receiving many honors, and Rockbridge none at all.
                        The Governor should not overlook the merits of "Phil," who would no doubt
                        wear the "shoulder straps" with dignity and grace. The following is an
                        extract from the somewhat lengthy jeremaid of "Phil:"</p>
                    <p>"But a word or so about this new Regiment. It will be seen that in the
                        appointment of officers, Augusta fares well. Inspector General Baldwin is
                        the Colonel. This is regarded as a good appointment, for Col. Baldwin has
                        the intellect to carry him through any position that may be assigned him.
                        But why double honors when there are still a few Augusta men without any
                        military titles? Col. Baldwin is Inspector General. Surely that is enough.
                        But it don't stop here. Augusta must be treble loaded with rank and titles.
                        The Lieutenant Colonel is Michael G. Harman, who, by his flaming
                        proclamations, has made himself familiar as household words to all the
                        people of West Augusta and a thousand other Western places besides, under
                        his stirring appeals and over his flaming signature of "Quartermaster and
                        Major Commanding." It appears that in the roaring tide of his affection for
                        Augusta, the Governor can find more titles and offices for that favored
                        county than he can find men to wear them. He had doubled Baldwin's, and when
                        it comes to his especial favorite, Mike, two ain't enough, he must give the
                        "Quartermaster and Major Commanding," a third, so that Mike can rise in his
                        stirrups, mount a new shoulder strap and equestrianize through the
                        thoroughfares of Staunton with Ostrich feather streaming out behind and a
                        longer title floating out before, so that we may all know that Mike, in
                        addition to what he was as Quartermaster and Major Commanding is now also
                        Lieutenant Colonel. Originally it was M.G. Harman, "Quartermaster and Major
                        Commanding," ex officio Governor of Western
                        Virginia; now with the rank and increased dignity of Lieutenant Colonel, why
                        cannot Mike also be know and revered as Lord of Augusta and Duke of
                        Staunton? In view of the double and treble burden of rank and title which
                        the Augusta Colonel and Lieutenant Colonel of this new Regiment have to bear
                        upon their physical constitutions, we would suggest that about six or a
                        dozen additional surgeons be appointed from Augusta (or the more favored
                        because more loyal Northwest) to this new and prodigally titled regiment, as
                        special guardians of the health of the two Colonels with five titles, to say
                        nothing of the ranks and degrees that belong to their ex
                            officios. </p>
                    <p>But what shall we say of the Major of this titulary Regiment? Well, we don't
                        know what. Just Major Ross, and nothing more; for he doesn't come in with a
                        long array of titles and ex officios. He
                        represents Rockbridge, but from what county he is from we don't know, and
                        refer the inquisitive reader to Gov. Letcher, who possibly may know from
                        whence he hails. "Know then this truth, Enough for us to know," </p>
                    <p>he is duly labelled and credited to Rockbridge. Let us be thankful for what
                        has been intended for our brave and gallant county, although she hasn't got
                        anything. We will take the will for the deed, and be grateful to the
                        Governor for what Rockbridge ought to have but what she has not got."</p>
                    <p>The editor of the Gazette, in reference to the article of "Phil," says:</p>
                    <p>"Our correspondent, "Phil," in speaking of the field officers of the Regiment
                        composed of the volunteers out of the militia of Rockbridge and Augusta,
                        does injustice to perhaps all of the gentlemen. As to the first, Col.
                        Baldwin, no better appointment could have been made, and we regard it as a
                        noble act in him in leaving a higher position and going into more active
                        service in a lower position. Indeed we regard it as pure patriotism for him
                        to take any military position. For our part, we would prefer the fame that
                        John B. Baldwin has as a lawyer, to the military fame of any of any man in
                        Virginia. If, therefore, Col. Baldwin estimates real greatness as we do, he
                        has no reason to aspire to any military position. None can elevate him above
                        the position which he has attained by the brightness of his own genius.</p>
                    <p>We know nothing of Mr. Harman as a military man.</p>
                    <p>In respect to Mr. Ross, we have always taken him to be an admirable
                        gentleman, and we believe that he stood well as a tactician at the V.M.
                        Institute.</p>
