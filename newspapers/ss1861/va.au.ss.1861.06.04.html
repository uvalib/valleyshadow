<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
     <p> We hope that no Southern man will suffer himself to become discouraged in consequence of
      the number of our enemies. He should remember that we are in the right, and that Providence
      will not suffer us to be defeated, if we perform our whole duty manfully and faithfully. "The
      race is not always to the swift, nor the battle to the strong." A contemporary well says that
       "the success of a gallant struggle on the side of right and justice,
       against wrong and oppression, is almost inevitable." A virtuous and gallant people in
      a good cause never have failed. If we are right, and do not falter, we must succeed. Weak as
      we may appear, and strong as the Federal Government may seem, in the hour of trial, we shall
      have the strength of David; our enemies the weakness of Goliah [sic]. Let us then rest assured
      that the battle is not with the strong, but to the vigilant, the active and the brave who
      fight for right." </p>

<b>What Shall We Wear?</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Urges citizens to economize so that more goods can be donated to the troops. In
     particular, citizens are requested to dress modestly and cheaply.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
     <p>Economy is a commendable virtue at any time, but it now becomes a patriotic duty. The people
      should now economize as much as possible, that they may have more means to contribute to the
      defense of the State, and to the comfort and necessities of our soldiers. The Revolution in
      which we are now engaged will demand heavy sacrifices, and we should prepare ourselves as well
      as possible to bear them. No money should now be expended for luxuries or mere display. We
      should now confine our purchases to the necessaries of life, and to such articles as are of
      positive utility. Business of almost all kinds has been paralyzed, and the majority of persons
      will suffer heavy losses. We hope that the merely ornamental will be sacrificed to the useful.
      The gentlemen should give up fine broad-cloth suits and be content with cheaper ones that
      would wear equally as long and be quite as comfortable. The ladies should be willing to forego
      the pleasure of appearing in costly silks, and high-priced bonnets. The fashion should now be
      to wear cheap and durable apparel. The time for "Flora McFlimseys" is when the country teems
      with wealth and smiles with prosperity. In such times as we have at present, they should be
      banished from the country. We hope that those whose means would enable them to dress
      extravagantly will set the example of appearing in a dress which will combine neatness,
      cheapness and durability. The wealthy can afford to do this without any suspicion that it is
      the consequence of pecuniary necessity, and will secure the praise of doing so through
      laudable motives. But as long as costly apparel is considered a badge of respectability and a
      pass-port to good society, the majority cannot afford to consult economy, unless the
      recognized leaders of the styles should make it fashionable to do so. The chief beauty of any
      dress consists in the fit, and it should be made to fit the times as well as the person. We
      hope to see unpretending calico dresses, which have been banished from the towns, again
      introduced. Who will set the example? What lady will lead in this laudable enterprise? The
      ladies of Staunton have as good a right to "set the fashions" as the less worthy ladies of
      Paris have.--Patriotism now demands it.</p>
