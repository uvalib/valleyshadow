                <summary>Col. Baldwin (of Augusta Co.) issued a statement outlining several
                    resolutions in his substitute for the majority report of the Committee on
                    Federal Relations at the State Convention (see below for the Majority Report).
                    According to Baldwin, the Convention should accept the amendments to the
                    Constitution proposed by the Peace conference as an acceptable resolution of the
                    current crisis. Second, the Convention should consult and act in concert with
                    the other Border states. Third, any attempt at armed intervention in the seceded
                    states will inevitably result in civil war, a war viewed as against the people
                    and institutions of fifteen states to which "the people of Virginia cannot be
                    inattentive or indifferent." The report makes clear that the conciliatory views
                    of Virginia will change drastically if any military force is used to enforce
                    Federal policies against the seceded states. Virginia will continue to pursue a
                    peaceful redress of grievances within the Union as the Constitution provides.</summary>

                    <p>A Southern gentleman who resides in Augusta, Ga., writes thus:--"If the South
                        were merely let alone for six months, we would probably try at the next
                        general election to get back. The new tariff will open both eyes and
                        pockets; 3 to 4 cents per pound on cheese, 4 to 5 cents on butter, 2 to 2
                        1/2 cents on sugar, 2 1/2 to 25 cents on tobacco, affect every one, and that
                        sensibly. Prices have advanced and are still ascending. Our regular army has
                        140 enlisted in this city, and as many in Savannah. Nine-tenths of our youth
                        go constantly armed, and the common use of deadly weapons is quite
                        disregarded. No control can be exercised over a lad after he is fourteen or
                        fifteen. He becomes MR. So-and-so, and acknowledges no master. While our
                        free trade doubles our tariff, our postal facilities will probably be raised
                        to 10 or 25 cents, and off the immediate line of railways there will
                        probably be at least one mail a week. Of course, therefore, we will like
                        secession the better as we become the better acquainted with it!"</p>

                <summary>This article is a copy of the Majority Report of the Convention. The report
                    of the Convention takes a more secessionist tone than the report of Col.
                    Baldwin. The report makes it clear that Virginia will not tolerate disruptions
                    in the institution of slavery and implies that compromises on the question of
                    slavery in the Territories will have to be reached in order for Virginia to
                    remain in the Union. The report also states that the Federal property in the
                    seceded states actually belongs to those states. Thus, the jurisdiction over
                    these properties rightfully reverts back to those states. The report states that
                    enforcement of the fugitive slave laws are a prerequisite to any settlement. Any
                    aggression against any seceded state will be considered an offensive against the
                    Commonwealth of Virginia and will determine her future policy.</summary>

                    conservatives who did not favor disunion at this time. The secessionists "would
                    not be satisfied until a Convention was called and they are not satisfied now
                    that one has been called." The article states that the secessionist will only be
                    satisfied in the event of war, which will force the Border States out of the
                    Union.</summary>

                    <p>In an editorial article advocating the propriety of referring the question of
                        secession to the vote of the people, the last "Vindicator" says:</p>
                    <p>"This brings the question immediately before the people. We ask that they may
                        act for themselves on this important question. They are honest and capable
                        and patriotic, their interests are immediately concerned. Which member or
                        members of the Convention will vote against this resolution, and record
                        himself as fearing to trust the people in the management of their own
                        business."</p>
                    <p>When the vote was taken on the 4th day of February last, for members of the
                        Convention, and for or against referring to the people, the editor of the
                        "Vindicator" voted AGAINST referring to the people. The people were as
                        "honest and capable and patriotic" then as now, and "their interests were as
                        immediately concerned". . . [text missing] . . . of the "Vindicator" voted
                        AGAINST giving them an opportunity to vote upon the action of the Convention
                        in which "their interests are immediately concerned," and by his own
