                    The article sites a resolution of the South Carolina Legislature stating that
                    the separation is final and the only "appropriate negotiations between her and

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>For some months our subscription list has been increasing in quite an
                        encouraging and satisfactory ratio, though altogether without solicitation
                        on the part of the friends of the paper or ourself. This fact assures us
                        that our list, as large as it is at present, could be greatly increased in a
                        very short time if the friends of the cause it advocates would use some
                        efforts to accomplish it. There are some persons in every neighborhood who
                        should take it who do not, and only need some one to mention the matter to
                        them to do so. Those who borrow it so regularly, and read it with so much
                        interest, should, by all means become, subscribers. They should not depend
                        upon the kindness of their neighbors for the privilege of reading it. To
                        those who will do us the favor to assist in increasing the circulation of
                        the "Spectator," we will feel under grateful obligations, and will cordially
                        reciprocate the kindness thus manifested by them.--The greater the number of
                        our subscribers, the greater will be the good we will be able to effect by
                        the advocacy of a patriotic cause. Let all, then, who approve of the policy
                        advocated by the "Spectator" use some effort to increase its circulation. We
                        do not ask, and do not desire any to put themselves to much trouble--we only
                        desire them, when convenient, to suggest to their friends the propriety of
                        taking some paper in these times of great interest, when all should be kept
                        "posted."</p>

<b>Thos. J. Michie, Esq. of '33 vs. Thos. J. Michie, Esq. of '61</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Compares Thomas J. Michie's present position on secession with his earlier
                    views. In 1861, he argued that secession was legal under the Constitution. In
                    1833, he argued equated secession with treason.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>As there is some conservatism in Virginia, and we seem anxious to secure an
                        honorable settlement, South Carolina is about to apply the spur again.</p>
                    <p>She first rejects unanimously the resolutions of
                        Virginia. </p>
                    <p>She secondly declares that her secession is final. </p>
                    <p>Lastly, she is going to force a collision. She has
                        instructed Gen. Hayne to demand Fort Sumter at once, and if it is not
                        surrendered, it is to be taken at all hazards."* </p>
                    <p>They know this will shed blood, and blood is necessary to "fire the Southern
                        heart."</p>
                    <p>We trust Virginia will scorn South Carolina. Let her fight her own battles.
                        She has kicked us enough. She has dragged us enough. We were for protecting
                        South Carolina against coercion by the Federal Government. But she is not
                        satisfied with this. We must enter upon a crusade with her for a civil war.</p>
                    <p>The prospects for a settlement are brightening every day. Mr. Millson writes
                        to Mr. Barbour, of Culpeper, that "he has never had so confident an
                        expectation of a satisfactory adjustment."</p>
                    <p>On the heels of this comes the effort to get up a collision. We cannot utter
                        our indignation.--If the people of Virginia are fools enough to be dragooned
                        any longer by South Carolina--we say, go ahead. God means to destroy you,
                        and the efforts of man are vain.</p>
                    <p>*The statement now is, that Col. Hayne will not make this demand, but that
                        the Convention which met at Montgomery on yesterday will do so.</p>
