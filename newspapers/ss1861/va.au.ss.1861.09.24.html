<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The system of unconstitutional, unlawful and despotic arrests and
                        imprisonments now carried on by the Lincoln Government, is an evidence of
                        conscious weakness, and would never be resorted to by a government which had
                        the slightest confidence in its own strength. That nothing of the kind
                        occurs under the Administration of President Davis, is a clear demonstration
                        that the Southern Government is embedded in the popular affections, and that
                        thrice armed in that panoply, it feels secure, both of the justice and the
                        might of its case.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A gentleman who was recently in Maryland, gives us a very interesting account
                        of the state of feeling among the people and of the horrible despotism of
                        the Yankee mercenaries. Arrests are nightly made of the most respectable
                        citizens; and in large districts of country, men never sleep at home. They
                        seek safety in the woods. Rougeries and outrages of all kinds are constantly
                        perpetrated. The negroes, almost without an exception, are true to their
                        masters, and have an intenser hate of the Yankees than even their mistresses
                        have. Very often, through their vigilance, their masters have been enabled
                        to escape the myrmidons of Lincoln. The wish, the prayer of the whole
                        population, white and black, men, women and children, is for the early
                        coming of Jeff. Davis' Army of DELIVERANCE. When that day does arrive, it
                        will witness such an uprising-- such an exterminating fury as the world has
                        never seen. The New York Herald states that the
                        Maryland population is so intense Rebellious that a Confederate army could
                        march from the Potomac to Baltimore without the fact being made known to the
                        Federal authorities by any of the inhabitants. Surely, such a people,
                        outraged and panting for liberty, have a right to all our sympathies and to
                        all the aid our arms can give them. Rich.
