<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It will be seen by reference to the proceedings of the Convention on
                        Thursday, that Ex-Gov. Wise said that the resolutions offered by Mr. Woods,
                        of Barbour, justified the course which he and four other Eastern members
                        pursued in the Convention in 1850, when they contended for equal taxation
                        and equal representation for the West and East. If justice to Western
                        Virginia demanded, as it certainly did, equality of taxation in 1850,
                        justice demands the same in 1861. It remains to be seen whether Mr. Wise
                        will endeavor, in the present Convention, to have justice done to Western
                        Virginia in respect to taxation. Since 1850, the State has been taxed to a
                        very large amount for the purpose of protecting the property of the East.
                        There are, if possible, stronger reasons for
                        equalizing taxation now than in 1850. No people, we venture to say, have
                        ever submitted with equal patience to such palpable injustice as the people
                        of Western Virginia have done. We hope thrt this Convention will do justice
                        to the Western portion of the State. The people of the West should demand justice at the hands of this Convention.
                            Fiat justitia, ruat calum.--Let justice be
                        done though the heavens fall.</p>

<b>The Rights of the People Disregarded</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Asserts that, if given the chance to vote, the citizens of all the seceded
                    states except South Carolina would have voted for the Union. The article argues
                    that the politicians in those states have usurped the rights of the people.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>An Appeal to the People</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Argues that any decisions regarding secession should be submitted to the
                    people for ratification. The decision cannot be left up to the legislature,
                    because this body as it is now composed is not representative of the
                    conservative unionist opinions of most Virginians.<br>

<b>The Chief Object--The Preservation of the Union</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>

                    Confederation in favor of the Constitution was to preserve the Union. Cites as

                    and statements from Washington's farewell address.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Secret Oath-Bound Cabals</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Blames secession on a conspiracy of secret societies which preserve order
                    by "secret management" in the face of increasing Union sentiment. Allegedly,
