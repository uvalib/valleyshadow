<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We understand that some of the extremists in this
                        and the adjoining counties say that "the "Staunton Spectator" is doing more
                        harm than any paper in the State." As what they mean by doing "harm" is the
                        influence it exerts in opposition to their efforts to precipitate the State
                        into secession, revolution and civil war, we accept it as the highest
                        compliment, and feel thereby encouraged to labor with more zeal and energy
                        in the cause of the Union and the preservation of peace and the avoidance of
                        oppressive and grinding taxation. If the extremists would never complain, we
                        would feel that we were laboring to but little purpose; for we are satisfied
                        that in proportion to their annoyance and complaints, we are exerting an
                        efficient and salutary influence. In the sense in which they use the term,
                        we are pleased to hear that the "Spectator" is doing "harm." We must
                        protest, however, against the acceptance of the whole extent of the
                        compliment conferred upon the "Spectator," for we do not believe, (as the
                        extremists to whom we have referred seem to do) that the "Spectator is doing
                            more harm than any
                        paper in the State." On the contrary, we believe that there are other papers
                        in the State which do much more of this good kind
                        of "harm" than the "Spectator." We are glad to know that such is the case,
                        and are pleased to see the Richmond Whig, the
                            Alexandria Gazette, the Lynchburg Virginian, the Petersburg
                            Intelligencer, the Charlottesville
                        Review and other papers in Eastern
                        Virginia doing so much of this kind of "harm," which is destined to save the
                        country from being desolated with the ravages of civil war, if that dire
                        calamity can, by any means, be avoided. If any doubt that the "Spectator" is
                        doing efficient service for the good of the country, we refer them to the
                        vexed and annoyed extremists who say that it is doing so much "harm." We are
                        rejoiced to know that we have so many co-operators in this portion of the
                        State in the work of "harm" in which we are engaged. In this glorious "Old
                        Augusta," in noble Rockbridge, and in Union-loving Rockingham, nearly the
                        whole people are with us, working "harm" to the schemes of the disunionists.
