<b>Battle on Top of Allegheny</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Details a battle involving Augusta troops.<br>(Names in announcement: Capt. Robert Lilley,  John Wood,  David Hamilton)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We gave a notice last week of the bravery and gallantry of our forces as
                        exhibited in the battle of the 13th inst., and of the glorious victory
                        achieved by them over a confident and vastly superior force of the enemy. We
                        venture to say that more gallant conduct was never exhibited upon any field
                        than was shown on that occasion by our officers and soldiers. The contest
                        was long and obstinate, but the enemy were forced, though greatly superior
                        in numbers to yield to the dashing prowess of our brave soldiers, who met
                        the onset of the enemy with a gallantry which rivalled [sic] the bravery of
                        the imperial Guard of Napoleon, and drove them in dismay from the battle
                        field. Our loss was about 30 killed, and about 70 wounded. The enemy's loss
                        was more than a hundred killed and more than 300 wounded. We had hoped that
                        we would be enabled to furnish in this issue a full and complete list of the
                        killed and wounded of our men, but have not been furnished with the names as
                        we had expected to be, and are thus compelled to publish an incomplete list.</p>
                    <p>In the early part of the engagement, the brave and chivalrous Captain P.B.
                        Anderson, of the "Lee Battery," fell mortally wounded, and died in a few
                        minutes.</p>
                    <p>Captain James Deshler, of the regular artillery, was shot through both
                        thighs, and it is feared will not recover.</p>
                    <p>Capt. Mayneham, of Hansborough's Battalion, was shot through the heart and
                        instantly killed.</p>
                    <p>In the "Augusta Lee Rifles," Capt. Robt. D. Lilley, commanding, John T. Wood
                        was killed, add [sic] David Hamilton wounded in the arm, though not
                        seriously. Missing none.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Wood fell after having repeatedly charged upon the enemy amid the iron
                        hail which was pouring around him, nobly discharging his duties, and while
                        still advancing upon them, driving them before him in a blockade of felled
                        timber. He was first wounded in the arm, but continued fighting, when two
                        balls entered the top of his forehead, ranging back along the left side of
                        his head, causing death almost instantly.</p>
                    <p>The following is the list of killed and wounded of the 31st Virginia
                        regiment.</p>
