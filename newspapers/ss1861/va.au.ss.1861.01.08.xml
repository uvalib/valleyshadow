                <transcript>
                    <p>Western Virginia is becoming aroused on the great question of disunion.
                        Groaning under a burden of uneual taxation, the people are wide awake to
                        their interest. The forum of the Legislature at Richmond this winter will
                        present an interesting scene for demanding and conceding rights, long
                        withheld, to the west, and long cherished by our eastern brethren in their
                        enjoyment. The west is uncompromisingly in favor of the Union, not merely
                        for the sake of the Union, but for the sacred and inestimable rights it
                        guarantees to the people.</p>
                    <p>"If a State Convention is called, the first question to be settled is the
                        basis of representation. The west will accept of nothing but the white basis
                        as now represented in the lower House.</p>
                    <p>"The Convention, when called, must have power to amend the Constitution of
                        the State, at least in that part which exempts a large portion of the slave
                        property from taxation.</p>
                    <p>"If delegates are to be appointed to a Southern Convention, those delegates
                        must be appointed by districts, arranged on the basis of the white
                        population of the State.</p>
                    <p>"The obvious justice of these demands must commend them to the approval of
                        all just thinking men. If our eastern brethren withhold these rights from
                        the west at this juncture it will take one hundred thousand bayonets from a
                        Southern Confederacy to force western Virginia into a union with the Cotton
                        States. We want all these questions settled before we join co- partners with
                        South Carolina."</p>

                    <p>SOUTH CAROLINA.--We have not seen it adverted to, that the ordinance of
                        Secession passed by the Convention of South Carolina, is not to be submitted
                        to the people. They are transferred like a drove of hogs. Even in Naples,
                        the other day, the people were allowed to vote upon the question of annexing
                        themselves to Sardinia.--The Emperor Napoleon and Victor Emanuel went
                        through the form in the case of Savoy and Nice. So of Tuscany, and the
                        Romagna, and the Duchies. It is reserved to South Carolina to take the first
                        step backwards. Their ideal is the Middle Ages. <emph rend="italic">The
                            people</emph> are a rabble.--They are to be governed not consulted. They
