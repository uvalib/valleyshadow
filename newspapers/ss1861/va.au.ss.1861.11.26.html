<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Spectator recommends that Southern farmers switch to foodstuffs until
                    the blockade ends so as not to produce an abundance of cotton, which cannot be
                    sold, while suffering from a food shortage.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Some of the Southern papers are suggesting the propriety of planting no
                        cotton next year unless the blockade is raised before the planting season
                        arrives. If the present crop can not be shipped, there is no use in raising
                        another to be kept at home. There is cotton enough on hand now to supply
                        Southern manufacturers for several years, and without a foreign market for
                        it, its production will be far less profitable than that of meat and bread.
                        The same remarks apply to tobacco, and the suggestion is worthy of serious
                        consideration.</p>
