                    <p>RICHMOND, April 19th, 1861.</p>
                    <p>MY DEAR SIR: Your letter of yesterday has been received. Before this you will
                        have learned through the Press all that has occurred at Norfolk and at this
                        place; but I cannot begin to give you a just conception of the excitement
                        created; not only here, but throughout the whole Southern country, by the
                        proclamation of the 15th, which, in many respects, may be regarded as the
                        most unfortunate document that has ever issued from the Government. In the
                        absence of that paper, this State could never have been carried out of the
                        Union; with it, the Union party, and the Union feeling, has been almost
                        entirely swept out of existence. You cannot meet with one man in a thousand
                        who is not inflamed with a passion for war, and
                        every one seems to regard the proclamation as a declaration of war for the
                        subjugation of the entire South, and for the extermination of slavery;
                        reason (with them on this point) would as soon arrest the motion of the
                        Atlantic, as it would check the current of their passions. </p>
                    <p>When I saw you in Washington, some ten days since, I had the honor to lay
                        before you and other members of the Cabinet, as well as before Mr. Lincoln
                        himself, a plan for the settlement of our troubles, through the medium of a
                        National Convention, to give to the seceded States leave
                            to withdraw. I thought then, as I do now, that the plan then
                        suggested was the only solution of the dreadful crisis which was upon us.
                        Since that time, matters have assumed a far more frightful aspect, and I now
                        venture to make one more effort to save the unnecessary effusion of
                        brothers' blood; and, in the name of liberty, humanity, and Christianity, I
                        implore you to give it your earnest and solemn deliberation. </p>
                    <p>I need hardly say that no man in this nation has held in higher appreciation
                        the value of our blessed Union. No man has labored more freely for its loss
                        than mine; no man can mourn more sorrowfully for its overthrow than I will.
                        No man can condemn more severely the immediate causes that have so
                        unnecessarily led us into this awful and terrible catastrophe than I do. Yet
                        for the first time, after an entire night of sleepless reflection, when I
                        prayed as I never prayed before for wisdom and strength to do my duty, my
                        mind has been brought to the conclusion that a dissolution is an inevitable
                        decree of fate.</p>
                    <p>I am satisfied that a contest on the part of the General Government, with its
                        perfect military organization, powerful Naval forces, its command of the
                        money, and its credit without limit, backed by eighteen or twenty millions
                        of people, against eight millions without military organization, without
                        naval forces, and without money or credit, is not likely to be of doubtful
                        result in the end--but after that, what then? Can the Union be preserved on
                        such terms, or would it be worth preserving if it could? After the best
                        blood of the country has been shed in war, which has passion, prejudice, and
                        unnatural but mutual hate for its foundation, intensified by the conflict,
                        could the two sections ever be brought together as one people again?-- and
                        would it not require large standing armies, in constant active service, to
                        conquer and maintain peace? And would not that end at last in a hateful,
                        loathsome military despotism?</p>
                    <p>If I am right in all this, would not a peaceful separation, not as a military
                        necessity, but as a triumph of reason, order, law, liberty, morality, and
                        religion, over passion, pride, prejudice, hatred, disorder, and the force of
                        the mob, be a far wiser and more desirable solution of the problem that such
                        scenes as will result from a purely sectional warfare, (result as it may,)
                        and from which the heart sickens, and the soil recoils with horror?</p>
                    <p>You may cut, maim, kill and destroy; you may sweep down battalions with your
                        artillery; you may block up commerce with your fleets; you may starve out
                        the thousands and tens of thousands of the enemies of the Government. You
                        may may overrun, but you cannot subjugate the United South; and if you could do all
                        this, you could not do it without inflicting an equal amount of misery upon
                        those who are its best friends, and who have stood as long as there was a
                        plank to stand upon, by the side of the Union, the Constitution and the
                        laws. Our streets may run red with blood; our dwellings may be leveled with
                        the earth; our fields may be laid waste; our hearthstones may be laid
                        desolate; and then at the last, what end has been gained? Why, the
                        Government has exhibited its power which has never been questioned, but by
                        the idle, the ignorant and the deluded, and for the display of which there
                        will be abundant opportunities, without an effort now, of either side, to
                        cut each other's throats! </p>
                    <p>So far from its being regarded as a betrayal of weakness by the other powers
                        of the Globe, will it not be looked upon in the present emergency as an act
                        of magnanimity and heroism on the part of the more powerful party to propose
                        terms of peace? Let me, then, as a strong, devoted, unalterable friend of
                        the Union, (if it could be maintained,)--let me
                        as a conscientious and unchangeable opponent of the fatal heresy of
                        secession, urge upon this Administration the policy of of issuing another
                        proclamation, proposing a truce to hostilities,
                        and the immediate assembling of a National Convention to recognize the
                        Independence of such of the States as desire to withdraw from the Union, and
                        make the experiment of separate Government, which it will not, as I think,
                        take them long to discover is the most egregious error that man, in his hour
                        of madness, ever committed. </p>
                    <p>In five years from this time the remaining United States would be stronger
                        and more powerful than the thirty-four States were six months ago--and you
                        will have a Government permanent and enduring for all time to come, to which
                        all who seek an asylum from oppression may resort hereafter.</p>
                    <p>I will not undertake to speculate on the experiment of a Southern
                        Republic;--my opinion on that subject are well defined, and too well
                        understood to make it necessary that they should be canvassed here. Let it
                        be tried, and let it work out its own salvation.</p>
                    <p>If this policy can be adopted, all I shall ask for myself, will be the
                        privilege of retiring to some secluded spot, where I can live in peace, and
                        mourn over the downfall of the best Government--wisely
                            administered--with which man was ever blessed. </p>
                    <p>I could not willingly take up arms against a Union that I have been taught
                        and accustomed to adore, as indispensable to my own liberties, and I never will raise my hand against my native
                        State, although her arm has ever been against me and mine. </p>
                    <p>For God's sake, let me implore you to let wisdom, magnanimity, true courage
                        and humanity prevail in your councils, and give peace to a distracted and
                        disssevered country.</p>
                    <p>I write as one who feels that he is standing on the brink of the grave of all
                        he has cherished on earth; my head is bowed down with grief over the madness
                        that rules the hour, and I pray God to give the wisdom to know, and the
                        strength to perform my duty, my whole duty to my country, my State, and my
                        friends.</p>
                    <p>I am, with great respect, yours, &amp;c.</p>

                    <p>Hon. EDWARD BATES, Attorney General,&amp;c.</p>
                    <p>Will you grant me the favor to lay this last effort to serve my country
                        before the Cabinet at its first meeting? I appeal to you as a native son of
                        Virginia to do it. <br>J. M. B. </p>

                    <p>BANKING OFFICE OF A. NICHOLAS &amp; CO., <br>No. 70 Wall Street,
                        <br>NEW YORK, 15th April, '61.<br></p>
                    <p>Col. J. M. McCUE,--Mt. Solon,--Dear Sir:--It is a
                        long time since I had the pleasure of writing you of your health. I have
                        been frequently informed by my friend Sibert who has been kind enough to
                        advise me occasinally respecting Mt. Solon and yourself. We have in this
                        city become highly excited by the news that Fort Sumter was fired into and
                        taken by the troops of the Cotton States. The President's message, calling
                        first for 75,000 troops and then increasing the demand to 175,000, has
                        produced a profound and deep impression that we are about entering into an
                        awful performance, the end of which no man can tell. The only hope now is,
                        that Va. will stand firm by the Union and hold all the border States to the
                        same line of policy--if she does, our misguided South Carolina friends can
                        soon be brought to reason--if she does not, but goes to swell the triumphal
                        car of secession, God knows the end. The universal sentiment here is, that
                        if the Border States do go out, then the war must exterminate the cause which has created this contention. When I
                        heard that South Carolina fired coolly and deliberately and wantonly upon
                        our flag, I cried like a child, that our brothers should fire into us. If
                        the men that did the deed could have seen the eyes that were dimmed, and the
                        stout frames of strong men that shook when the news was received here, they
                        would have wished that the earth had swallowed them up. The newspapers and
                        office seekers have done their best to set the sections against each other.
                        May God forgive them I can't!--My Dear Sir, will Virginia secede? What is
                        your opinion? Pray let me hear from you soon. <br>Yours, A. NICHOLAS. </p>

                    <p>MR. A. NICHOLAS,--Dear Sir: Yours of the 15th inst., came to hand a few days
                        ago. Circumstances that have occurred since, have more than answered one of the interrogatories you ask with so much
                        apparent feeling, "Has Virginia seceded?" She has not only seceded, but has
                        on this morning, an army in the field, to defend our rights and
                        institutions, that will carry terror to the hearts of those who vauntingly
                        boast that they will "exterminate the cause," as you are pleased to term it,
                        of all the difficulties between us. Could you, and the myrmidons of
                        abolition, of agrarianism and all that is abominable in a free government,
                        see, as I have had the opportunity within the past few days, the spirit of
                        our people, your craven hearts would collapse within your cowardly
                        carcasses. You who possess means to justify it, will send your hired mercenaries to overpower us, it may be. You
                        may devastate our country, burn our towns, insult and abuse our women, but
                        conquer us you can never do. When our brave and gallant sons are
                        exterminated, if such could be, you will find our wives and daughters more
                        than a match for all the Beechers, and Cheevers and Stowes and that damnable
                        set that you have so long paid Court to, and encouraged, until you have
                        brought this affliction upon the country. </p>
                    <p>You speak of our "institutions" being the cause of
                        this war, and you will exterminate it forsooth. Let me tell you, sir, that
                        it has been the misguided frenzy and folly and madness of your people, that
                        has been the cause; and that people that has fattened and flourished upon
                        the labor of this institution, and in your pharasaical and puritanical
                        self-righteousness, after hoarding this wealth, would say to us, "stand
                        aside, we are holier than thou," and cannot live under the same government
                        with you. Let me say to you, sir, that the men of New York and New England
                        who, in the war of 1812, could stand by with folded hands and see the flag
                        of their country trailed and trampled in the dust, and convene themselves
                        into a Hartford convention, and refuse to furnish men and means to defend
                        their country and that flag from an insolent foreign foe, can with a very
                        bad grace now shed tears, as you say you did, when you heard that flag was
                        fired upon at Fort Sumter. Your damnable hypocrisy makes my blood boil, and
                        in spite of myself, makes me pray that we may have the earnestly hoped for
                        opportunity of meeting you in sight of the Potomac, and all those who, like
                        you, have been shedding those crocodile tears, and there testing, in the
                        sight of the ashes of the Father of his Country, your sincerity in defending
                        that flag. But permit me to say, sir, that you will not be there. You, and
                        those who think like you, will send as your personal representatives, the
                        miserable mercenary foreigners, that you can gather up in your cities at $10
                        per month to do your fighting. Would to God it were otherwise, and we could
                        meet you all in person, and your boasted Seventh Regiment besides, who have
                        warmed at our firesides, slept under our roofs, shared our hospitality, and
                        when it was in your interest to do so, have preached up your conservatism.
                        But enough, sir, I have not patience to say more. In the hope I may meet you
                        at Washington, (what I do not expect,) I am, sir, yours. <br>J. MARSHALL

<b>How Virginia was United</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reproaches those who blame the Union men for the current state of war
                    because they resisted immediate secession. The article says that by attempting
                    to compromise, the Unionists forced Lincoln to develop a policy that united all
                    Virginians in opposition. If secession had occurred before compromise efforts
                    were exhausted, there would have been parties in Virginia discontented with such
                    an action.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We have no disposition, says the Lynchburg Virginian, to obtrude old party
                        issues upon the people now, believing that everything of the kind should be
                        deprecated and avoided. Our people are united, as they ought to be, in
                        opposition to Black Republican oppression and tyranny. Yet, we occasionally
                        hear some indiscreet persons reproaching those who were more reluctant to
                        anticipate the issue now forced upon them by others--with being the authors
                        of the mischief we are now suffering. Such persons assume--and it is the
                        merest assumption--that if we had presented a united front in the beginning
                        of the present troubles, there would have been no conflict. They forget that
                        it was simply impossible to bring our people to that point, and that, if
                        even a majority had been found willing to separate from the Union one month
                        ago, a very large minority would have been restless and dissatisfied. The
                        moral force of our action would have been impaired, if no worse consequence
                        had ensued. But, by our patient efforts in behalf of the Union, compromise
                        and peace, we forced Lincoln to a development of his policy, and such a
                        development as has united us to a man. This is the best vindication that
                        could be given of the wisdom of our policy. In confirmation of this view, we
                        submit the following from the Richmond "Examiner," a journal that lampooned
                        the Convention and the Union men with unwonted severity.--the "Examiner"
                        says:</p>
                    <p>"The bug-bear of civil war need not frighten no one. We are not engaged in
                        Virginia civil war, and, thank heaven all danger of that most dreadful of
                        human scourges is past. It almost reconciles us to the
                            delay of the Convention.-- That delay has
                            made Virginia a unit--has made the whole
                            South a unit. The natives of the South are leagued and
                        confederated to repel Northern invasion, and establish Southern
                        independence. </p>
                    <p>And the "delay" of the late Union men brought about this "league" and hearty
                        confederation of Southern men. This shall be our consolation amidst all the
                        sorrows that may await us.</p>
