                <summary>Davis gives a speech announcing the ratification of the Confederate
                    government by the states of the Confederacy. He argues that its formation is the
                    true continuation of democratic traditions begun in the Revolution and recently
                    subverted by the North. Davis also describes the functions of some of the
                    Confederate offices and the services they will perform.</summary>
