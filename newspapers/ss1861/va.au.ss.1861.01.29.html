<b>All Should Vote--Heavy Responsibility</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Encourages the citizens to vote for conservative-minded men for the

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Democratic papers, as is well known, have heretofore prated loudly about
                        the wisdom, patriotism and intelligence of the "dear people," and have professed great solicitude about the rights and
                        privileges of the only true sovereigns, but now
                        every Democratic paper we have noticed, with three exceptions only, is
                        opposed to that clause of the Convention bill which gives the people the
                        poor privilege of voting whether or not the action of the Convention shall
                        be submitted to them for their ratification or rejection. These professed
                        friends of the "dear people" are for stopping the mouths of the sovereigns
                        when they fear they will not favor secession, civil war and grievous
                        taxation. </p>

<b>Louisiana Gone</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>

<b>Reasons for Voting for "Reference"</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Asserts that the Southern Senators that remain in Congress are attempting
                    to scuttle compromises in order to effect the outcome of state conventions by
                    making it appear that a solution within the Union is impossible. Thus, the
                    Spectator urges citizens to vote to refer the convention's decisions to the
                    people in order that a grave determination shall not be made by "152 men in
                    secret session."<br>

<b>Gen. Scott Burnt in Effigy</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>

<b>Border Slave States</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>An extract from a letter from Gov. Hicks of Maryland to Hon. J.L. Curry,
                    the commissioner of Alabama. It points out that the border states suffer more
                    from Northern interference with slavery than do the seceded states and that
                    civil war will disproportionately devastate the border states. Gov. Hicks
                    charges that these facts were disregarded by the "headlong action" of states
                    that would drag all to war and ruin.<br>
