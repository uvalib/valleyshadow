<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> The Boston Journal recently published a statement
                        to the effect that several Yankee shoemakers, who had been employed in
                        Staunton, Va., were driven away from the place after being imprisoned, et.
                        Mr. G. S. Raymond, late foreman of the Staunton Shoe Factory, who is also a
                        New Englander, has the honor and moral courage to refute this gratuitous
                        slander. He publishes a card in the Journal, in
                        which he says that the party referred to "were not interfered with in any
                        manner at Staunton, but were perfectly free to go away or remain, as they
                        chose." It seems that they preferred to leave, and went "through the entire
                        route without any molestation whatever." Mr. Raymond closes his card by
                        saying: </p>
                    <p>I have to advise the friends of those remaining there that they need have no
                        fear regarding their safety--they are free to remain or leave, as they
                        choose. The probability is that they will leave, as they have a perfectly
                        free route from Staunton to the Pennsylvania line by stages.</p>
                    <p>"Justice to the honorable gentlemen of the Staunton Shoe Company, and justice
                        to the good people of Staunton generally, demands of me these
                    statements."</p>

<b>Lincoln's Pledge not to Invade</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Expresses hope that Lincoln will keep his inaugural promise not to invade
                    the seceded states apart from those localities or properties previously held by
                    the United States.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>If Lincoln has any regard for the most positive pledge given by him in the
                        midst of the imposing ceremonies of inauguration, and under the solemn
                        sanction of that "oath" which he speaks of as being "recorded in Heaven,"
                        there will be "no invasion" of our State beyond the localities of the
                        property heretofore held by the United States Government, and "no using of
                        force against or among the people anywhere."</p>
                    <p> It will thus be seen that he gave the most positive assurance, under the
                        most solemn circumstances, that the "power confided" to him would not be
                        used to any degree "beyond what may be necessary to hold, occupy and possess
                        the property and places belonging to the Government," and that beyond this
                        there would be "no invasion--no using of force against
                            or among the people anywhere." If, in violation of this pledge,
                        he should send troops into the interior of the State, he would show that he
                        is a falsifier in whom the truth cannot be found, and that he has a poor
                        chance, unless a radical change takes place, even to see the record of his
                            "oath in heaven." </p>

                    <p>"Virginius," the Charleston Correspondent of the Richmond Dispatch, aims some
                        very severe, though well-deserved, blows at those miserly and contracted
                        souls who would speculate upon the present dire necessities of the people by
                        demanding exorbitant prices for the necessaries of life. The following is an
                        extract from the letter of that correspondent:</p>
                    <p>"We have in this city set very good examples to the world of disinterested
                        patriotism, but I begin to hear occasionally that some "hoarse voice" that
                        was heard in revolutionary times in Hanover county, as described by Wirt in
                        one of Patrick Henry's speeches against an unprincipled speculator--"Beef,
                        beef, beef." Provisions in our city all at once popped up 50 per cent.--Hams
                        now sell at 20 cents, sides 17 cents, coffee 18 1/2 to 20 cents, flour
                        $10.50 to $12.50, and butter 50 cents. In most instances these provisions
                        were held by Yankee agents, here, and in some instances by natives, but the
                        mark will be as indelibly fixed upon them for all time as that put upon the
                        first murderer, Cain, by the finger of God Almighty, and right that it
                        should be.</p>
                    <p>In times like these, no man with a soul will speculate upon his neighbor and
                        his people, and he who does it ought to be made to feel the weight of public
                        odium and disapproval.</p>

<b>The Different Kind of Soldiers</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article claims that the South is sending its best sons to war while the

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>One of the most melancholy features of the horrible and bloody strife into
                        which this country is about to be involved consists in the fact that the
                        very best portion of the population of the South will be required to meet in
                        mortal combat, in great part, the very worst population of the North.
                        Whenever the South shall lose a soldier, it will lose a valuable citizen,
                        whose loss will be sensibly felt, whereas the North would be benefitted if a
                        large portion of its soldiers would never return from the battle-field. The
                        flower of Southern honor and chivalry will cross swords with rowdies,
                        cut-throats and burglars from the corrupt cesspools of Northern cities.--the
                        South sends into the field honorable, honest, moral and virtuous soldiers,
                        the North such desperadoes, and dangerous men as she is afraid to keep at
                        home. As an illustration of the spirit of our people, and the kind of men
                        who are volunteering their services to the State, we will mention the fast
                        that a number of Minsters of the Gospel who are distinguished for talents,
                        cultivation, eloquence and piety, have exchanged the "sacred desk" for the
                        soldier's tent.</p>
                    <p>The Rev. Dr. B. M. Smith and Rev. Dr. R. L. Dabney, Professors of the "Union
                        Theological Seminary," Rev. Dr. Moses oge, Pastor of the 2nd Presbyterian
                        Church in Richmond city, and Rev. Dr. Pendleton, Rector of the Episcopal
                        Church in Lexington, all of whom are well known in this county, have
                        connected themselves with volunteer companies. Dr. Pendleton is now Captain
                        of an Artillery Company in Lexington, being elected to supply the vacancy
                        caused by the promotion of Capt. McCausland to the post of lieutenant
                        Colonel of Volunteers. As Dr. Pendleton is a graduate of West Point, and has
                        served several years in the army, he will no doubt make a good and efficient
                        officer.--Though the conflict may be terrible, we do no doubt that, in time,
                        the Northern "Apollyon" will succumb to the Southern "Christian," and that
                        our brave soldiery who go forth clad in the panoply of a just cause, will
                        return with their banners--though "tattered and torn"--wreathed with the
                        laurels of victory.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The following comes from adopted citizens of Charleston, and is well
                        endorsed:</p>
                    <p>Fellow-Countrymen:--Being impressed with the first and great duty which we
                        owe to the land of our adoption in these its present difficulties, we are
                        carrying out measures for organizing a Confederate Irish Regiment, for the
                        service of the Southern States. This, we must admit, is expected from us.
                        Let us take up the cause of an honorable, just and upright people. They
                        never interfered with our religious institutions, a subject which our
                        friends of Massachusetts must have forgotten very soon; or is it possible
                        that the burning of the Charlestown Convent did not make an impression, and
                        open their eyes to the true character of their hightened [sic] Puritanic
                        leaders? Although Know-Nothingism crept into a few sections of the Southern
                        States from the hot-beds of the North, it was crushed in its embryo by our
                        noble and chivalric people, who are too exalted to lend themselves to the
                        encouragement of any doctrine that would have such direful effects on the
                        prospects of their adopted fellow-citizens.</p>
                    <p>No man was ever persecuted in the South on account of his religious belief.
                        And do our countrymen at the North forget how eager their neighbors were in
                        publishing and circulating books detailing disgusting lies about escaped
                        nuns for the purpose of arousing the feelings of the Prostestant [sic] sects
                        against the Catholics? We appeal to you for your decision in favor of the
                        Southern cause, and also for the justification of the position we are about
                        assuming in standing manfully by it.</p>
                    <p>Strange scenes are being developed every day. There is one of the exiled sons
                        of Ireland who was received all through the Southern States (as only a noble
                        and generous people know how)--making preparations to march alongside of
                        John Bull, heart and hand, to subjugate the very people who conferred on him
                        the greatest encomiums, and had his name enrolled as an honorary member of
                        their societies, and denominated military companies in respect to him. But
                        is this to continue? No. Never again shall the name of Thomas Francis
                        Meagher be united with any of our Southern institutions. We say, let them
                        come, and learn that the foreigners of the Southern States have hearts as
                        true as their steel in maintaining the rights and independence of the South.</p>
                    <p>We therefore submit to you a plan for organizing our regiment. There are a
                        great many of our countrymen already enlisted in the service of the Southern
                        Confederacy, and hence our inability to raise a regiment immediately
                        here,--We have appealed to Georgia. The prospects are promising, and it
                        naturally struck us that our countrymen in Virginia would be anxious to
                        participate in the movement. If so, we will appoint place of rendezvous as

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It is said a good many persons in this county will vote against the secession
                        of Virginia; a report which I can hardly credit. I have been as strong a
                        Union man as any one, perhaps, in the county, but believing, as I now do,
                        that the last hope for a reconstruction of the Union on fair and honorable
                        terms has fled, and that it is utterly impossible for the North and the
                        South to live together in peace, I have come to the conclusion to vote for
                        secession. Until within a few days, I thought I would not vote at all; but
                        learning from various Northern newspapers the fiendish feeling that is
                        exhibited by the whole North towards us of the South, I shall now go with
                        all my heart and soul for the South. How anyone after reading the editorials
                        of many of the leading papers published at the North, can vote against
                        secession, or even not vote at all, I cannot imagine. Is it not the
                        threatened policy of the North to invade our State and take from us by brute
                        force, our lands, our houses, and all that we possess, and divide it among
                        themselves? Their cry is "booty and beauty," which means, in plain English,
                        as I understand it, to steal our lands from us, and ravish our females. Any
                        one that doubts can get the newspapers and read for themselves.</p>
                    <p>And now I would ask, in conclusion, brave men of old Augusta, can you, will
                        you, stand this? Rather, will you not defend your mothers, your wives, your
                        daughters, and your sisters, to the very death. Then, let all come to the
                        polls, and show the North that we have not a man amongst us who, in any way
                        whatever, is willing to give the faintest shadow of a hope that he is not
                        true to the South.</p>
                    <p>AUGUSTA.</p>
