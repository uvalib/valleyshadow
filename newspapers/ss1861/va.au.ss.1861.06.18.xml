                <transcript>
                    <p>We have been requested to invite the Ladies of Staunton to meet this
                        (Tuesday) evening at 5 o'clock in the basement story of the Lutheran Church,
                        for the purpose of adopting ways and means, by concerted and systematic
                        action, to provide for the relief and comfort of the sick soldiers now in
                        this place. Too much praise cannot be awarded to the ladies of Staunton for
                        the noble efforts which they have made and are continuing to make for the
                        comfort of the soldiers. We have no doubt this meeting will be well
                        attended, though the notice is very short. The watchful care of the ladies
                        is taxed to compensate for the remissness of those whose duty it is to have
                        the comforts of the soldiers properly provided for. This would be a sad and
                        dreary world without the presence of woman.</p>
