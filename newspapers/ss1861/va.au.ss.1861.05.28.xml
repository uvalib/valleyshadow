                <origin/>
                <commentary/>
                <excerpt/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>The question is frequently asked: "What has become of the great Union party
                        of Virginia?" In answer to this question, we say that the Union party still
                        exists, in full force, with many valuable accessions from the ranks of those
                        who spurned us as submissionists, tories and enemies to our Southern
                        country.</p>
                    <p>We claim no union with that party that would break down one section to build
                        up another; or with that Administration that would reject all honorable
                        proposals to settle a difficulty between two sections of a Republic, and be
                        willing to sacrifice a noble and happy country to a silly, sectional
                        platform, erected by a few political demagogues and fanatical hypocrites,
                        who, by unparalleled intrigue and ignoble wire-working, succeeded in
                        elevating a miserable miscreant to the Presidency, who, after calling around
                        him the vilest of the vile, ignores the sovereignty of States and denies the
                        right of revolution for un-redressed wrongs.</p>
                    <p> But we claim to be a Union party under the powers that be; and we have
                        patriotism enough to uphold and sustain that Government of which we claim to
                        be a part, and <emph rend="italic">in</emph> which we claim an equal
                        interest with any and every other section, so long as she is worthy to hold
                        an honorable station among the powers of the earth.--But when by intrigue,
                        corruption and usurpation, she becomes polluted and unfit to hold a place
                        among the civilized nations; when we find our rights invaded, our
                        institutions in danger, our peace destroyed, and we can find no means of
                        redress, we then claim the right of revolution; we step aside from the
                        polluted fabric, and seek freedom, independence and peace elsewhere. </p>
                    <p>Our friends of the cotton States, whose interests are intimately connected
                        with our own, on account of sectional wrongs and political grievances,
                        fanatical meddling and unparalleled abuse, being thrust upon them and us for
                        many years, and persevered in with a zeal and apparent hatred that was
                        continually on the increase, was fit to sever the ties that bound them to
                        the Federal Government, and seek freedom and independence within their own
                        limits.</p>
                    <p>They invited us to join our interest with theirs in a struggle for freedom.
                        We thought their action premature; we considered them rash; we thought
                        proper to demand redress of our grievances at the hands of the Federal
                        Government we used all means that wisdom could devise, or patriotic
                        eloquence portray, to gain a listening ear and a favorable response, and
                        while these efforts were pending we were called anything else but honest
                        men.</p>
                    <p>While one last effort was being made by the friends of peace the response
                        came. It was heard at Sumter! It was reiterated in the proclamation of
                        Abraham Lincoln! It was seen in the preparations made by the Federal
                        Government to coerce the Southern States! And that response severed the last
                        link that bound the Union party of Virginia to the United States Government.</p>
                    <p>And now we are a Union party in the Southern Confederacy, and ever will be so
                        long as our patriotism is appreciated, our rights respected, and the
                        Southern Republic worthy the name she now assumes.</p>
                    <p>Where is the great Union party of Virginia? The quick response to the call to
                        arms will answer. The appropriations of the County Courts will answer. The
                        readiness of the people every where to give their means and best energies
                        for the defence of the State will answer. Where are they? When the conflict
                        comes--and come it must--the crack of the rifle and the booming cannon will
                        answer, Here! Here!</p>
                    <p>The craven-hearted wretch who now with-holds his means and shrinks from the
                        responsibility of sustaining Virginia in her present relations, may be
                        worthy the name of submissionist, tory, or an enemy to our Southern country,
                        but he is not worthy a place or a name in the great Union party of Virginia.</p>
                    <p>A Union Man.</p>
