<b>Virginia, God Bless Her</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Praises Virginia's commitment to fight the tyranny of Lincoln.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> We are prouder than ever of the land of our birth. Virginia gives this day
                        satisfactory assurance to the world that she has not "lost the breed of
                        noble blood." Her long patience and forbearance under wrongs and injuries
                        will not henceforth be construed into timidity or a time serving policy, by
                        the world, or by any portion thereof. She has defined her position in
                        characters of living light. At the first open declaration of hostilities on
                        the part of the Northern aggressor, she defiantly displays in his presence
                        her time-honored flag, with its motto so suggestive to all Tyrants.</p>
                    <p> Her sons, from the sea-shore to the mountains, come forth with unexampled
                        enthusiasm to uphold "that standard sheet" at the risk of life, fortune and
                        sacred honor. The moment Virginia calls upon her sons to come to her rescue,
                        the voice of party and of faction is hushed, to be heard no more till her
                        battle shall be fought and her victory won. The call of Lincoln for 2,300
                        troops from this State, to assist him in reducing our sisters of the South
                        to subjugation, will be responded to by forty times that number, if need be,
                        to assist in teaching him and his councilors a lesson of humility which they
                        will never forget. The spirit of patriotism which animated our forefathers
                        in the days of '76, still burns in the hearts of their sons! God bless the
                        old Commonwealth!--Enquirer of April 23rd.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>This is not time for crimination and recrimination. All discord is as, as it
                        should be, avoided, and the whole band performs in perfect harmony. Men
                        stand shoulder to shoulder in one common cause. No question need be made as
                        to what road individuals took to arrive at the point where all stand, it is
                        enough to know that we are a unit. None have stood firmer for the Union than
                        we, while we believed there was the least shadow of hope of a reconstruction
                        and preservation; but, alas, the day of hope is past, the die is cast and
                        our once happy Union is broken beyond the possibility of repair.</p>
