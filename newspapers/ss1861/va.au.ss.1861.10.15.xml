                <transcript>
                    <p>Our readers will be amused when they read the communication published in
                        another column signed "Veritas." The logic of the writer is of a very
                        remarkable kind. If Aristotle and Whately could have seen that communication
                        they would doubtless have been convinced that their rules of logic were
                        worthless. "Veritas" says that</p>
                    <p>"The war that is now convulsing the country and spreading dismay through the
                        land, is the resistance of the people to an encroachment upon their rights
                        by Federal Power--State Rights against Federal usurpation and tyranny--the
                        political doctrine of Jefferson against that of Alexander Hamilton."</p>
                    <p>And yet Col. Baldwin, the "bold, talented and brave," who is now risking his
                        life to make successful the "resistance of the people to encroachments upon
                        their rights by Federal Power," who is sustaining "State Rights against
                        Federal usurpation and tyranny" is declared by "Veritas" to be a "dangerous
                        man because his sympathies are with the Hamiltonian school of politicians."
                        "O, most lame and impotent conclusion!"</p>
                    <p>"Veritas" further says:</p>
                    <p>"He (Baldwin) does not believe in the principles of government which lie at
                        the foundation of the Southern Confederacy and for which our brave armies
                        are now breasting the storm of death that sweeps over the battle field."</p>
                    <p>And yet Col. Baldwin, in defence of the freedom and independence of the
                        Southern Confederacy, is now "breasting the storm of death that sweeps over
                        the battle field." Is Col. Baldwin so false and treacherous as to support
                        principles he does not approve, or such a simpleton as not to know the
                        character of the principles he is striving to defend even at the peril of
                        his life? No. For even "Veritas" acknowledges his great "<emph rend="italic"
                            >admiration for his pure private character and intellectual
                        endowments.</emph>["] </p>
                    <p>"Veritas" urges as an objection to him that</p>
                    <p>"He is now a member of the State Convention, a Colonel of Volunteers, a
                        visitor to the University of Virginia, State proxy in the Central Railroad,
                        and is asking the people to elect him to Congress. Had it been at all
                        allowable, he would have retained his easy berth of Inspector General."</p>
                    <p>To the first office mentioned, he was elected by the people of this county by
                        nearly a <emph rend="italic">unanimous</emph> vote--the second, he agreed to
                        accept with all its labors and perils, through by so doing he gave up "his
                        easy berth of Inspector General," an office of higher rank and more pay and
                        attended with no danger--the other two are not offices of profit or
                        emolument and were conferred upon him by his <emph rend="italic">political
                            opponents</emph>. </p>
                    <p>"Veritas" says that,</p>
                    <p>"The political views of Col. Harper are in exact harmony with the interests,
                        the honor and the growth of the Confederate States."</p>
                    <p>This proposition we do not deny, but maintain that if it be true, then are
                        the political views of Col. Baldwin in "exact harmony with the interests,
                        the honor, and the growth of the Confederate States," for their "views" were
                        the same as late as November last, as the following brief statement of focus
                        will prove.</p>
                    <p>About the 1st of November last, forty eight persons published a call in both
                        the papers of this place, "recommending that the people of Augusta,
                        irrespective of party, assemble in mass meeting at Staunton, on Saturday,
                        November 17th, 1860, to consult as to what steps are (were) necessary for
                        the preservation of the Union in the (then) present alarming condition of
                        our country."</p>
                    <p>In accordance with that call, the people assembled, when, on motion, it was
                        resolved that a committee of thirteen should be appointed who should
                        "consider and report to the people of Augusta on the 4th Monday of November
                        such matter and resolves as said committee might deem expedient for the
                        people of Augusta to consider and adopt." The following gentlemen
                        constituted that committee: Hon. A. H. Stuart, H.W. Sheffey, Geo. Baylor,
                        Jno. B. Baldwin, Kenton Harper, Jno. L. Peyton, Jno. D. Imboden, Geo. M.
                        Cochran, jr., Joseph A. Waddell, Jno. McCue, Benj. Crawford, G. B. Stuart
                        and Robt. Guy.</p>
                    <p>On the day appointed, the 26th of November, the people assembled, and the
                        Court-house was crowded to its utmost capacity. The committee, of which Col.
                        Harper and Col. Baldwin were members, <emph rend="italic">concurred</emph>
                        in the report which the committee presented and which the people adopted by
                        a large majority--the vote being taken on <emph rend="italic">each</emph>
                        proposition. Col. Harper made some remarks in defence of the report in the
                        meeting in reply to objections on the part of some who desired some
                        modifications of the report. So upon the great principles and policy which
                        should be adopted, the "political views" of Col. Baldwin and Col. Harper at
                        that time were the same. </p>

                <summary>Calls attention to a letter elsewhere in the issue that attacks Baldwin for
                    being a Hamiltonian. The writer alleges that Baldwin is too positioned both
                    militarily and economically to represent the people. The Spectator defends
                    Baldwin against this attack.</summary>

                <transcript>
                    <p>Mr. EDITOR: In an article published in the Rockingham Register over the
                        signature of "Veritas," the writer argues as an objection to the election of
                        Col. Baldwin as a member of Congress from this District, that he has always
                        been an Anti-States Rights man, trained in the Hamiltonian School of
                        politics, and that in the organization of our new Government he will be
                        likely to exercise a dangerous influence.</p>
                    <p>In answer to this objection, which is the chief one offered by "Veritas" for
                        the benefit of the public, I beg leave to present you with an extract from a
                        private letter received a few days ago from Col. Baldwin. It is as follows:</p>
                    <p>"As to my politics, I doubt if there is a man in the whole South who goes
                        further for States Rights or strict construction than I do. I did not do so
                        under the United States Government, because its history was very different,
                        and its policy different. But I am what is called an individualist, and, as
                        such, am opposed to the exercise of authority and power by any Government
                        beyond the absolute necessity of its own preservation."</p>
                    <p>From this extract it will be seen that whatever may have been Col. Baldwin's
                        peculiar notions in regard to the theory of the United States Government, he
                        is, under our new one, as sound as any man in the South, and that holding
                        such views in regard to it, it would be quite as impossible for him to exert
                        a dangerous influence in the Confederate Councils as it would be for
                        "Veritas" himself, who, judging from the tenor of his article, was doubtless
                        among the first to resist Federal encroachments upon the rights of the
                        States.</p>

                    <p>This Congressional District.</p>
                    <p>MESSRS EDITORS: I observe in the last number of the Staunton Spectator the
                        announcement of two candidates for Congress, viz.: Col. John B. Baldwin and
                        Col. Kenton Harper, both of Augusta county. It was the wish, I believe, of
                        the voters of the entire District, that the present able and distinguished
                        representative, Judge Brockenbrough, should continue to represent the
                        District in a position which he has filled with such marked success and
                        dignity; but as he has, I understand, peremptorily declined the use of his
                        name in that connection, it is very apparent to the most superficial thinker
                        that, as between the two candidates announced, Col. Harper should, without
                        hesitation, be chosen. The objections to Col. Baldwin are numerous and
                        insuperable. While admiration for his pure private character and
                        intellectual endowments cannot be withheld, yet his political sentiments are
                        so obnoxious, and if carried into effect, would be so destructive of the
                        spirits, the interest and the object of our Confederacy, that no loyal
                        citizen of the District can, for a moment, think of supporting him. The war
                        that is now convulsing the country and spreading dismay through the land, is
                        the resistance of the people to an encroachment upon their rights by Federal
                        Power--State Rights against Federal usurpation and tyranny--the political
                        doctrine of Jefferson against that of Alexander Hamilton. Col B. is a
                        dangerous man, because his sympathies are with the Hamiltonian school of
                        politicians. He does not believe in the principles of government which lie
                        at the foundation of the Southern Confederacy and for which our brave armies
                        are now breasting the storm of death that sweeps over the battle field.
                        Bold, talented and brave, he would bring to the support of his dangerous
                        political sentiments, if a seat in Congress were assigned him, an array of
                        influences that might well make the sternest of us shudder for the
                        successful initiation of our new government. It is fresh in the minds of the
                        people how he brought the powerful energies of his great intellect to bear
                        against the progress of the South, in the State Convention; how he dared and
                        defied public sentiment and the rights of the South by his outrageous vote
                        to retain in his seat the infamous Carlile, while that miscreant was
                        plotting treason to devastate and flood with ruin, disgrace and blood the
                        old Commonwealth--to fasten upon us the yoke of Northern oppression and
                        vassalage. It is scarcely necessary, however, to more than direct attention
                        to the political record of Col. Baldwin, for the people to recall his many
                        acts of hostility to the true interests of the government of which Virginia
                        is now a part. We are satisfied that the loyal voters of this District will
                        never endorse that record by elevating him to a position where he could
                        exert such a direful influence against the prosperity of the Confederate
                        States of America.</p>
                    <p>The modesty of Col. Baldwin's card is in striking contrast with the political
                        experience of that gentleman. One would suppose that he is neither an
                        office-seeking nor an office-holding individual. But when the public is
                        informed that he now enjoys the honors and emoluments of <emph rend="italic"
                            >four</emph> offices and is asking the people for another, it will have
                        a tendency rather to convince them than otherwise that he is not the man to
                            <emph rend="italic">decline</emph> position. He is now a member of the
                        State Convention, a Colonel of Volunteers, a visitor to the University of
                        Virginia, State proxy in the Central Railroad, and is asking the people to
                        elect him to Congress. Had it been allowable, he doubtless would have
                        retained his easy birth of Inspector General. </p>
                    <p>It is not the purpose of the writer to draw any extended or labored contrast
                        between Cols. Baldwin and Harper. Suffice it, that the political views of
                        Col. Harper are in exact harmony with the interests, the honor and the
                        growth of the Confederate States. He is a gentleman of fine intelligence,
                        spotless private chararter [sic], chivalrous and brave--one whose heart and
                        soul and estate are in the struggle that is now being waged to secure the
                        Independence of the South. Contrast the cards of the two candidates, and the
                        reader can well determine which of them is the man to represent this
                        District in the Congress of the Confederate States. No man treads the earth
                        who has nobler impulses or more exalted ideas of public virtue and honor
                        than Kenton Harper. He is the man for the times, and his election would
                        secure for the District an able, faithful and influential member of
                        Congress.</p>
                    <p>It is a vital question for the people to decide, and it is to be hoped they
                        will make the selection with reference to the best interests of the
                        government which is now about to be definitely inaugurated.</p>
