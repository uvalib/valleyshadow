                <summary>Warns that the Secessionists will make a vigorous struggle in the Spring
                    election and will, if victorious, claim a mandate for secessionist feeling in
                    Virginia. The article cautions that Virginia could end up with two conventions
                    claiming sovereignty and perhaps even a situation, as in Texas, where the
                    Convention ousts the Governor. The article asks those of Union sentiment, be
                    they Democrats or Whigs, to put aside party differences and elect men who have
                    evinced a preference for the Union.</summary>

                <summary>Writer states that the institution of slavery will be more threatened with
                    disunion because the ability to have fugitives returned will be greatly
                    hindered. This will cause slaves to flee in droves and will make their
                    replacement difficult.</summary>

                    a ready excuse for disunion.</summary>

                    the Douglas Elector for the Augusta district and who is part of the plot.</summary>
