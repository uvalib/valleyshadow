<b>The Approaching Canvass in Virginia</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Warns that the Secessionists will make a vigorous struggle in the Spring
                    election and will, if victorious, claim a mandate for secessionist feeling in
                    Virginia. The article cautions that Virginia could end up with two conventions
                    claiming sovereignty and perhaps even a situation, as in Texas, where the
                    Convention ousts the Governor. The article asks those of Union sentiment, be
                    they Democrats or Whigs, to put aside party differences and elect men who have
                    evinced a preference for the Union.<br>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Writer states that the institution of slavery will be more threatened with
                    disunion because the ability to have fugitives returned will be greatly
                    hindered. This will cause slaves to flee in droves and will make their
                    replacement difficult.<br>

<b>The Infamy of Secession</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Denounces secessionists for precipitating the crisis now at hand. The
                    article blames the secessionists for defeating the nomination of Douglas and for
                    preventing the election of Bell for the purpose of getting Lincoln in office as
                    a ready excuse for disunion.<br>

                    the Convention that passed the Ordinance of Secession as well as his ouster as
                    Governor. He states that he will make no endeavor to maintain his authority as
                    Chief Executive and will leave the government in the hands of those who have
                    usurped his authority. He states that he remains committed to the maintenance of
                    the Union and the Constitution.<br>
