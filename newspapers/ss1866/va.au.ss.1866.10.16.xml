                    day of thanksgiving and praise to Almighty God." Johnson also recommends that
                    people "implore Him to grant to our National Councils, and to our whole people,
                    that Divine wisdom which alone can lead any nation into the ways of the good."</summary>

                    <p>The result of the elections which took place in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana
                        and Iowa last Tuesday is expressed by the familiar apothegm: "The Dutch have
                        taken Holland." This result in not very strange and not unexpected. A more
                        favorable result was hoped for, but scarcely expected, except by those who
                        allowed their wishes to control their judgments. It was hoped that the
                        Conservatives would be able to reduce the Radical majority in Congress. But
                        in the elections which have occurred, the Radicals have gained one or two
                        members. What will take place in November another month will reveal. We
                        suppose that the Radicals will be at least as strong in the next Congress as
                        in the last, and may have sufficient strength to control legislation in
                        spite of the Executive veto.--Whether they will venture upon the impeachment
                        of the President time alone will reveal.--The present times demand patience

                    <p>It is never wise to repine at misfortunes which cannot be repaired. The true
                        philosophy is to forget them if possible. Never bother the mind about them,
                        for thinking only broods increased trouble. Our duty as well as policy is to
                        do what we conceive to be right and just, and leave the consequences to a
                        wise Providence that overrules all. The people of the South have done all,
                        in the way of concession, that they can do in consistency with their honor
                        and self-respect, and it is their duty now to stand calmly, but firmly, in
                        opposition to any further concessions in obedience to the behests of the
                        dominant party North. "Masterly inactivity" is now the policy of the South
                        so far as political questions are concerned. With them, politics should be
                        laid on the shelf, and party prejudices be buried in the tomb of the
                        Capulets. The faces and attention of our leading men should no longer be
                        turned toward the National Capitol. Their minds should be directed to the
                        development of the practical and material interests of the South. Here there
                        is labor for both mind and muscle. There should be no drones in the hive of
                        Southern population. All work should be at work. In the language of the
                            <emph rend="italics">Examiner</emph>, "we have our families to feed, our
                        fences to re-build, our homes to embellish, our fortunes to carve out of the
                        rich smiling face of this fair land. We have digging to do, and sowing, and
                        reaping; we have money to get, the exhaustless hidden treasures of our soil
                        to bring to light and activity. What care we for the blatherings and the
                        scoldings of a pitiful and insensate faction? Nothing. To-day we do our
                        appointed task, letting them rail as they list; to-morrow they will have
                        vanished like evil vapours that the night winds have conjured out of damp
                        and darkness.</p>
                    <p>And we can afford to wait. The right is with us, and all the revenges of
                        times will react in our favor and to our behoof. Little parties and little
                        men may have their little triumphs, and live through their brief day, but
                        truth, and equity, and justice are eternal, knowing neither day nor night,
                        not 'broken lights,' but the full and perfect day. We do not depend upon the
                        prevalence or failure of a policy or a party; our existence is not bound up
                        in any system, nor shall we shrink from the discharge of any duty, nor be
                        impatient of any obligation, because clouds, however dark, obscure our sun.
                        Upon <emph rend="italics">ourselves</emph> we depend; in our own strong arms
                        and cheerful hearts, and in the good God above us we put our trust, and
                        whatever chances, these shall not fail us."</p>
