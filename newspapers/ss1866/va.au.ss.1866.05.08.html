<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A petition from "146 loyal citizens of Staunton" was recently presented in
                    Congress. It is suspected to be the work of W. J. Dews, who has been rumored to
                    be circulating petitions of a suspicious character. The petition claims that
                    "loyal" citizens of Staunton have been "persecuted by rebels" and calls for the
                    return of federal troops. The editor expresses outrage at this "slandering of
                    the citizens of Augusta."<br>(Names in announcement:  W. J. Dews)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It will be remembered that, shortly after the Federal troops were withdrawn
                        from this place we announced that we had been informed that W. J. Dews was
                        engaged in getting signers to a secret petition praying that the troops be
                        sent back to this place, and charging that "Union men were, otherwise , not
                        safe. When asked by us if it were true, Dews denied it, and asserted that it
                        was a petition to Congress for an entirely different purpose. The citizens
                        of Staunton were justly indignant, and though they were anxious to see the
                        petition, it was never made public, and they heard nothing more of it till
                        Wednesday evening last, when the papers, containing the telegraphic notice
                        of the proceedings of Congress of the day before, were received, when they
                        found that Senator Trumbull had presented to the Senate of the United States
                        a petition purporting to be a petition of "146 loyal citizens of Staunton"
                        never signed it.--Clarity compels us to believe that the large majority of
                        those who were inveigled into signing it were ignorant, simple-minded
                        denizens of the brush who did not know the purport of the paper they were
                        signing. We can forgive them for they knew not what they were doing. They
                        were too ignorant to know that they were disgracing themselves, whilst
                        slandering the citizens of Staunton, and the people of the county generally.
                        We warned unsuspecting Union men at the same time against the nefarious
                        designs of the author of the petition, and told them that he would make a
                        catspaw of them to subserve his own selfish purposes. We stated that he
                        wished to gain notoriety that he might be the recipient of a better office
                        than the one he then held and disgraced. He has since been appointed Notary
                        Public, and is now an applicant for still more important one, to wit:
                        --Commissioner under the Civil Rights Bill.</p>
                    <p>Those who perpetrate such an abominable slander against any people as that
                        contained in this petition against the citizens of Staunton, have an object
                        to attain. Othello would say:</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>"I will be hanged if some eternal villain,</p>
                    <p>Some busy and insinuating rogue,</p>
                    <p>Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office,</p>
                    <p>
                        Have not devised this slander."
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>No greater evidence of the patience, forbearance an long suffering of the
                        citizens of this community could be furnished than the fact that they have
                        allowed a man to remain unmolested in their midst who has been engaged in
                        secretly slandering them to the authorities who only need a pretext to
                        increase the burden of oppression now unjustly heaped upon them. The last
                        ounce of weight broke the camel's back.</p>
                    <p>There is a point beyond which forbearance ceases to be a virtue. that point
                        has been nearly reached, and it is time for some to heed the admonition.
                        Justice will finally be done, old scores will be settled, and the "devil will get his Dews."</p>
