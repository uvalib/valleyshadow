<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Richmond Whig</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We understand, says the Richmond Whig, that the
                        sober, staid, respectable colored residents of Richmond are much chagrined
                        by the ambitious pretensions and disorderly and minatory proceedings of the
                        organized bands were stopped by General Terry. They complain that these
                        organizations are composed, for the most part, of colored persons who have
                        neither homes nor permanent interests in that city; of idle, dissolute and
                        dissipated vagrants, who have wandered to that city from distant quarters.
                        Respectable colored people complain of the evil influences exerted by white
                        emissaries from the North, and that they intend to adopt some satisfactory
                        method of making their opinions known. They have found out also that the
                        Freedmen's Bureau is, for the most part, administered in the interests of
                        the Radical party, and not of the freedmen; that it is a political machine
                        whose aim is to foment discord between the whites and blacks. Those colored
                        people who are intelligent, who have property, or regular occupations, have
                        no interest in common with the vagrants who, under the influence and
                        direction of low white men and the paid agents of Radicalism, are
                        threatening the whole South with disturbances. Sooner or later the orderly,
                        well-behaved colored classes will have to draw the line between themselves
                        and the disorderly classes. The sooner they publicly take their true
                        position, separate themselves from the turbulent characters whose aim is to
                        involve the whole colored population in trouble, and exert all their
                        influence, privately and publicly, individually and in aggregate, to put
                        down the mischievous black men, and infamous white men who stand at their
                        backs, the better it will be for us all.</p>
                    <p>There is no reason why the two races, each maintaining its true and natural
                        position in the scale of society, should not live together in harmony. The
                        better classes of whites exert all their influence to these ends; why should
                        not the better classes of colored people do the same? If they disapprove the
                        turbulent conduct of the inferior classes of their own color, or of the
                        mischievous interference of white Radical incendiaries from the North, and
                        are satisfied that our courts and our citizens will do them justice --
                        respect their rights and protect them in their persons and property they
                        ought, in some authentic form, so to declare, so as to silence the
                        numberless calumnies invented by the Radicals.</p>
