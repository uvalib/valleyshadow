<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The President, says the Richmond Times, no longer
                        makes a State secret of the fact that he will in a very short time issue an
                        official proclamation that the late civil war is ended.--When he does this
                        he will have accomplished the last and highest act which the Executive
                        Department of the Government can perform towards the restoration of peace.</p>
                    <p>He cannot compel Congress to admit Representatives from the Southern States,
                        but his proclamation will subordinate military to civil authority, and place
                        all the States composing the Union upon a footing of equality in that
                        respect.</p>
                    <p>The privileges of the writ of habeas corpus will
                        then be within reach of the humblest citizen of the South,and our State
                        government will become supreme within the limits of the States for the
                        protection of whose citizens they were organized.</p>
                    <p>Martial law, which now reigns supreme in eleven States, will then only be
                        potent for the control and punishment of those who are connected with the
                        army, in the manner defined by the Articles of War. Every great right
                        guaranteed by that grand and famous Virginia Bill of Rights, which looks
                        very sadly out of place in front of the "Alexandria Constitution," will then
                        be enjoyed by our citizens. Particularly dear to every honest, fearless,
                        patriotic journalist will be that Article which declares that "the freedom
                        of the press is one of the great bulwarks of Liberty, and can never be
                        restrained but by despotic Governments."</p>
                    <p>The Southern people, after a probation of nearly twelve months, will hail the
                        proclamation of peace with great joy. And yet, as far as our resistance to
                        the authority of the Constitution and laws of the United States is
                        concerned, there has been peace the most profound and undisturbed since the
                        1st of May last. The history of civil wars, ancient and modern, furnish no
                        more remarkable and striking instance of the speedy and honest acquiescence
                        in the result of a contest than the people of the South have done since
                        their armies capitulated. The sun of the Confederacy sunk, leaving no margin
                        of gradually darkening twilight. The blackness of darkness fell upon the
                        "lost cause" as rapidly as night follows, the setting of the sun in Eastern
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>The inexorable logic of the war convinced the people of eleven States with a
                        rapidity without precedent in the history of the world. No thought of
                        resistance of the Federal Government kept a single guerilla in the field an
                        hour after the capitulation of LEE and JOHNSTON.-- The utter futility of
                        further resistance was universally admitted, and in the heart of Virginia
                        and North Carolina, a sergeant's guard made arrests as easily as they would
                        have done under the guns of Fortress Monroe.</p>
                    <p>The good faith of the people of the South has been, during the last ten
                        months, manifested in many different ways. A labor system, which the habits,
                        customs and usages of many generations had rendered part and parcel of the
                        South, was annihilated in a day, but despite the terrible temporary
                        annoyances which its destruction visited upon our people, they bore the
                        change with wonderful fortitude and equanimity.</p>
                    <p>Indeed, in a infinite variety of ways we have demonstrated to all impartial,
                        unprejudiced persons, our fitness for the judicious exercise of those great
                        civil rights which are so soon to be restored to us by the President. His
                        forthcoming proclamation of peace will be recognized by all conservative
                        Northern men, and by all christendom, as a most wise and statesmanlike
                        exercise of the most important functions of his high office.</p>

<b>Treatment of Negroes</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>

                    Southerners to "treat the negroes harshly" by legislating "unpleasant relations

<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Richmond Whig</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We are forced, says the Rich. Whig, to the conclusion that these Radical
                        fanatics desire to compel us to treat the negroes harshly, and that to this
                        end they are endeavoring by law to establish unpleasant relations between
                        the two races. They want the negroes to look up to them, and they propose to
                        confer upon them the elective franchise in order that they may exercise it
                        in their interest. They make so much fuss over them that their heads are
                        completely turned. Their poor intellects are bewildered, and they really do
                        not know what to do or which way turn. So many promises are made them, so
                        much time devoted to measure relating to them, and so many expectations
                        excited in their minds, that they are kept in a state of feverish anxiety.
                        They are cajoled out of the larger portion of the little money they get, by
                        hook or crook, by school marms, or preachers, or pedlars, or -- worse than
                        all -- politicians, who get up meetings among them and induce them to
                        contribute money to various projects, chief among which is the appointment
                        of delegations to go to Washington to act upon Congress and pay unwelcome
                        visits to the President. Where there is one honest man and sincere friend of
                        the negro thus engaged, there are a thousand rogues and wretches who are
                        using them to promote their own selfish ends. they make more out the negro
                        than the negro will ever make out of them. Leaving out of consideration the
                        bounties of the Government distributed through the officers of the
                        Freedmen's Bureau, where is the negro who has received any help from these
                        pretended friends. They have had advise --volumes of it; and oaths --
                        volleys of them; but when, where, and from whom have they received private
                        benefits and charities? When the negro wants to be flattered or fleeced, he
                        may go to these people -- nay, they will go to him. But when he wants a
                        scuttle of coal or a stick of wood to keep him from freezing, or, to use his
                        own language, "a meal of victuals" to keep him from starving, or clothing to
                        cover his nakedness, he neither goes to there people, nor do they go to him.
                        He goes to "his natural enemies -- the Southern whites" -- and gets what he
                        wants. His pretended friends are ready to give him suffrage to spite the
                        South , and to vote him lands, and food and clothing, when it costs them
                        nothing, or to get up subscriptions to relieve his wants, when the money is
                        to pass through their hands, and they can keep back a large share of it as
                        "the recompense of their reward" -- but when it comes to giving of their own
                        substance, they would see him in Jericho first.</p>
