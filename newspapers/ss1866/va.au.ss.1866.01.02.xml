                    improvements in the state, even if it requires capital from outside Virginia.
                    Wise also reportedly lavished praise on "the citizens of 'Old Augusta,'" calling
                    them "the best and most noble people in the country."</summary>

                    <p>Gen'l Early, "old Jubal," as he was called by the soldiers, is in Havana, and
                        expects to got in a short time to the city of Mexico. We publish in this
                        issue a letter of his dated Havana, December the 18th, 1865, addressed to
                        the Editor of the N. Y. News. If not rebellious, he is still unrepentant,
                        and, like, "Bill Arp," does not want any "short winded, one horse pardon."
                        He says that he would not accept a pardon from the President of the United
                        States if gratuitously tendered him without conditions or restrictions of
                        any kind -- that he has nothing to regret in the course pursued by him
                        during the war, except that his services were not of more avail to the cause
                        for which he fought -- that his faith in the justice of that cause is not at
                        all shaken by the result, and that the world has never witnessed so great a
                        political crime as that committed in the destruction of the Confederate
                        Government by armed force. He shows that great disparity in the forces of
                        the two parties engaged in the war, and says that more glory attaches to the
                        "heroic band of Confederates" than to the "Grand Army of the Union."</p>

                    <p>A clergyman who was in Alexandria at the time says, that the negroes
                        commenced parading the streets on Sunday night, armed with pistols, knives
                        and clubs, and marching to the beating of drums. They kept up this
                        demonstration until Christmas morning. On Christmas day, they insulted a
                        number of white persons in various ways. They halted in front of several
                        houses, uttering threats at the inmates, shouting at and cursing the
                        inhabitants generally, and brandishing their knives and pistols. Finally,
                        these disgraceful scenes culminated in an attack upon a white man who was
                        passing along the street. A general fight soon after ensued between the
                        whites and blacks, which resulted in the killing of several persons, and
                        among them a Mr. Mitchell, who belonged to the 2d United States regiment of
                        District of Columbia volunteers. The white persons engaged in the riot were
                        entirely of the class known as "loyal." General Augur has directed as
                        investigation to be made into the circumstances of the riot, and will bring
                        all parties responsible for the affair to justice.</p>

                    <p>Those who anticipate so much danger from the reception of colored testimony,
                        under the forms and sanction of the law, instead of in patriarchal courts of
                        the family and the farm, do not sufficiently distinguish, we think, between
                        the <emph rend="italics">competency</emph>, and the <emph rend="italics"
                            >credibility</emph> of a witness.--To declare a witness <emph
                            rend="italics">competent</emph>, is simply to allow him to be heard. To
                        be <emph rend="italics">credible</emph> he must be worthy of being <emph
                            rend="italics">believed</emph>. The law prescribes and the court
                        decides, as to the competency of a witness; the jury judges of his
                        credibility, and values his evidence accordingly. It must not be feared,
                        therefore, that cases in court would be decided simply upon the wild
                        statements of mendacious colored witnesses. Our citizens have been so long
                        accustomed to study the character, and weigh the statements of the slave
                        population, that there is little danger of any intelligent jury, aided by
                        the bar, being imposed upon by perjuries when they have the witness before
                        them, and are thus enabled to question him, and to watch his countenance,
                        and compare his different statements.--<emph rend="italics">Rich.
