<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Amendments to the Constitution require the concurrence of three-fourths of
                        the States. As there are but 36 States at the present time, the ten Southern
                        States which are excluded, by standing firmly in opposition to the
                        amendment, can prevent its adoption. In the language of the World, "if the ten excluded States stand united,
                        the amendment cannot be forced upon them until the number of States is
                        increased to forty. True, a few years may suffices to make this addition;
                        but Kentucky and Maryland will equally decline to ratify, as the amendment
                        would also reduce their weight in Congress. Instead of ten non-ratifying
                        States, there will, therefore, be twelve; which would require the whole
                        number of States to be increased to forty-eight before the amendment could
                        be carried, which will not be in this great part of the white population of
                        Missouri will be permanently excluded, as at present, from their political
                        rights. As Missouri is not a negro suffrage State, the party in power may
                        not choose to hasten its downfall by ratifying the amendment. In that case,
                        there would be thirteen non-ratifying States, and thirteen can post-pone the
                        adoption of the amendment until the number of States is increased to
                        fifty-two, which is a greater number of States than we are likely to have;
                        the Territories being only nine; and the present thirty-six States being
                        sixteen less than fifty-two. Even when the whole seven Territories shall
                        have become States, eleven non-ratifying States will suffice to defeat the
                        amendment. So far is it from being true that the amendment must prevail at
                        last, if the South shall steadily resist it."</p>
                    <p>If we do not wholly mistake the temper, moral courage, firmness and manhood
                        of the Southern people they will never place the brand of degradation upon
                        their own brows, and will, in the determined language of Col. Baldwin,
                        firmly resolve, "that, come what may, they will oppose
                            to this outrage a calm and steady and persistent negative."</p>
