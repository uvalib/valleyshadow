<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It is now plainly evident, says the Richmond Examiner, that the late riot emanated from and was instigated by the
                        Radical leaders who inflamed and armed the negroes, while the authorities,
                        the police, and the peaceable citizens did all in their power to prevent and
                        afterwards to suppress the riot. The telegraphic accounts are more than
                        borne out by the mail reports, which show, beyond question, that the whole
                        scheme was an infamous Radical attempt to overturn the State and city
                        government, and the letters of correspondents, as well as the extracts from
                        New Orleans press published, all foreshadow the deliberate preparations for
                        the recent Radical riot, and the detailed account of the riot fully confirms
                        the fact that a revolution was intended.</p>
                    <p>This the Radical leaders still have in mind, and preparations are extensively
                        made in various parts of the South to force a war of races; the recent
                        drilling of armed negroes, and their midnight parades through the streets of
                        Richmond, under the direct management of such men as Wardwell and Hunnicutt,
                        which was timely stopped, was calculated to precipitate at any moment a
                        scene similar to that of New Orleans.</p>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
