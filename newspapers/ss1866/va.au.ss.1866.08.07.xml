                <transcript>
                    <p>Two years ago, when Gen. Banks held military sway in Louisiana, a Convention
                        of Union men, many of them being men from the North, adopted a State
                        Constitution, and organized the State Government to suit themselves.--That
                        Government was approved by President Lincoln, and is the present Government
                        of that State. By this constitution, the whites were not disfranchised and
                        the negroes were not franchised. The Radicals at this time, desiring to
                        disfranchise the whites, except the Radicals, and to confer the right of
                        suffrage upon the negroes, adopted the expedient of calling together the
                        Convention which had adjourned two years ago. The President of the
                        Convention, the only persons who had the right to do so, if it can be
                        supposed that any one had the right to resurrect that dead body, refused to
                        call the Convention together. A portion of the members then met in caucus an
                        elected a man President who was not a member of the Convention, as he had
                        previously resigned. This man called the Convention to meet at New Orleans
                        on the 30th ult. Some twenty-odd met with the view of superseding the
                        Government they had established two years ago. In the mean time it seems
                        that the negroes had been instigated by those conspirators to arm themselves
                        and make menacing and insulting demonstrations, with the hope, no doubt,
                        that it would result in conflict and bloodshed, and thereby furnish capital
                        for the Radical party.</p>
                    <p>Several circumstances seem to confirm this view. At the beginning of the
                        riot, Dr. Dostie, a leading Radical, shortly afterwards killed, remarked:
                        "There is not a negro in New Orleans who is not organized and
                        prepared."--Mr. Cutler, another Radical, on seeing a negro fall dead,
                        remarked: "That fixes us and ends the power of the d--d rebels."</p>
                    <p>The New Orleans <emph rend="italics">Times</emph> says:</p>
                    <p>"We have the best reasons for supposing that for several days vile attempts
                        have been made to excite the negroes into rebellion, and to organize them
                        into bands for that specific purpose. This view of the matter is
                        strengthened by the disclosure made last night by R. F. Daunoy, relative to
                        the expected rise of the negroes in the Third District at 12 o'clock last
                        night, under a man named Bertin, but whether white or black, we could not
                        learn."</p>
                    <lb/>
                    <p>The <emph rend="italics">Times</emph> gives the following account of the
                        origin of the riot:</p>
                    <p>A procession of freedmen, some 100 to 150 in number, with a flag and band of
                        music at their head, came marching up from the lower part of town towards
                        Mechanics' Institute.</p>
                    <p>A white man, who was standing on the neutral ground looking on, was shoved
                        aside by one of the freedmen, and tripping against the curbstone, fell.</p>
                    <p>The policemen in the neighborhood on seeing this supposed that the white man
                        had been struck, and advanced to arrest the supposed assailant.</p>
                    <p>The policemen were met by a volley of pistol shots, bricks, etc., which at
                        once induced a general alarm.</p>
                    <p>The procession marched on to the State House. The New Orleans <emph
                            rend="italics">Crescent</emph> says:</p>
                    <p>"In the vicinity of the State House, as we have heard, some white and colored
                        boys got into a quarrel. White men standing on the steps of the House,
                        exhorted the negroes to kill every white person -- man, woman or child --
                        who interferred with them.</p>
                    <p>About this moment the police, apprised by Mr. Crevon of the dangerous state
                        of affairs, came on the spot. The doors of the State House were immediately
                        closed. Shots were fired on the police. Some five or six hundred persons,
                        blacks and whites, made a fortress of the State House. Twice or thrice they
                        made offers of surrender, and, when the police advanced to receive the
                        surrender, they were met with pistol shots.</p>
                    <p>A terrible excitement spread abroad. It seemed as if a war of races was
                        precipitated upon the people with all its horrors. It was a day of anguish
                        to every citizen of New Orleans.--But in the midst of all that excitement we
                        witnessed some beautiful instances of charity. A negro who had but one arm,
                        and who, it may be supposed lost his other arm in the Federal army, was
                        pursued by some boys, and the poor darkie was protected by a gentlemen, who
                        had been a so-called "rebel" in the Virginia army.</p>
                    <p>The conflict in front of the house might be called a battle. The people
                        inside were in a desperate situation. Occasionally a rally was made, with
                        desperate resolution, but no sally could drive these men from their place.
                        It was a field of capture or of slaughter, where resistance was offered.</p>
                    <p>The contest was carried on for about two hours. A number of policemen, whose
                        names we have not learned, were wounded in the struggle. But they never gave
                        an inch.</p>
                    <p>We saw a gentlemen wearing the uniform of the United States, conspicuous
                        among the gallant men who assailed the State House. Dr. Dostie was severely
                        wounded, and his worst wound was from this soldier, a Massachusetts
                        gentleman, who proclaimed that the white should be the ruling race of this
                        continent.</p>
                    <p>Some 20 or 30 negroes were killed in the encounter.</p>
                    <p>The universal expression of sentiment was that of regret that the poor negro,
                        who was incited to demonstrations of violence, was the victim of the
                        contest, while the white man, who had inflamed him, escaped. Nevertheless, a
                        few of those, who seemed to love incendiarism, met their fate."</p>
                    <p>The policemen, whilst receiving the fire from the negroes in front, labored
                        to keep back the mass of enraged citizens who pressed to take part in the
                        bloody conflict. The accounts of the number of killed and wounded differ
                        very much. We suppose that the number of killed is about 30 and the number
                        of wounded probably 70 or 80, including blacks and whites. In a despatch to
                        Gen. Grant, two days after the riot. Gen. Sheridan reports 40 killed, and
                        about 160 wounded, including whites and blacks.--More blacks than whites
                        were killed.</p>
