                    <p>Alex W. Greaver, who has been confined in the jail of this county for some
                        time past, on the charges of stealing corn, oats, meal, &amp;c, from
                        Jacob Baylor, Esq., and a lot of hogs from Mr. Franklin Koiner, has had his
                        case thoroughly ventilated before Capt. Tukey of the Freedmen's Bureau at
                        this place, under the orders from Gen. Terry. It was represented to Gen.
                        Terry that the prisoner was a persecuted Union man, and, in consequence of
                        this <emph rend="italics">false representation</emph>, he was allowed the
                            <emph rend="italics">privilege</emph> of a thorough investigation of his
                        case before the Freedmen's Court. The points endeavored to be established by
                        the counsel for the prisoner were, that Greaver was a Union man, and that he
                        could not get justice before the civil court, neither of which points were
                            <emph rend="italics">very clearly</emph> established, he (Greaver)
                        having voted for the ordinance of secession and was in the service of the
                        Confederacy for a long time, and nearly all the witnesses concurred in the
                        opinion that a man's political sentiments would have not influence on the
                        minds of the civil court of this county. In contemplating this case we are
                        reminded of the story of the Irishman who was, on one occasion, arraigned
                        before a court of justice for some grave offense, against which proceeding
                        he raised very serious objections, and, on being told that he need not be
                        afraid, he should have justice, replied -- "Faith, and that's what I'm
                        afraid of."</p>
                    <p>There was a large number of witnessing examined, and the papers in the case,
                        which were very voluminous, have been sent to Richmond for the inspection
                        and decision of Gen. Terry. If the Union is to be preserved by such men as
                        these, and civil authority to be trampled under foot by the military, our
                        prayer is -- Good Lord deliver us.</p>
                    <p>The examination was conducted by the James Bumgardner, Commonwealth's
                        Attorney for this county, and David Fultz on behalf of the prisoner. The
                        examination of witnesses occupied three days and occasioned considerable
                        interest.</p>
