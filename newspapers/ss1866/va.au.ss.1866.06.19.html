<b>Charge of H. W. Sheffey</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Excerpts from Judge Sheffey's charge to the members of the Grand Jury at
                    the opening of the latest session of the local Circuit Court. Sheffey asked for
                    their aid in "throwing the protecting power of the law around the freedmen,"
                    explaining that "we of the South are 'as a city set on a hill'--we are seen and
                    scrutinized by all men." Sheffey argued that if freedmen are able to protect
                    their rights in state courts, the Freedmen's Bureau will soon be "dispensed
                    with."<br>
