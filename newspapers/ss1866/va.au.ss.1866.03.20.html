<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>As we walk along the streets we see in all the stores and shops dozens of
                        corn brooms which are brought here for sale. This should not be the case. We
                        live in a country admirably adapted to the growth of broom corn, and with an
                        abundance of timber to make the handles.--Cannot some enterprising citizen
                        establish a broom-factory in our town? It would give employment to a number
                        of persons who need it, and keep a great deal of money among us which would
                        otherwise be sent abroad.</p>
                    <p>The true secret of prosperity is to make every thing we can at home, and buy
                        as little as we can abroad.</p>
                    <p>Many other occupations might be found which would yield profitable employment
                        to capital and labour.</p>
                    <p>We have two large foundries now in a process of erection which will furnish
                        the means of subsistence to a hundred or more people. Let us not confine
                        ourselves to this department of industry. Keep the ball in motion and
                        develop home resources.</p>
                    <p>Those countries flourish most which give a concrete form to labor, and sell
                        manufactured goods instead of the raw material.</p>
                    <p>We have fine water-power around the town. It is a reproach to our enterprise
                        to see it unemployed. Why not re-build the woollen factory, or substitute in
                        its place some other useful machinery?</p>
                    <p>While we all go for re-constructing the Union, we must not forget that it is
                        our duty also to re-construct our labor system, and re-establish our
                        prosperity. We certainly cannot effect this latter object without the
                        exhibition of industry and enterprise. We must sell more than we buy, and we
                        must manage to incorporate as much labour as we can into the articles sold.</p>
                    <p>New England had the sagacity to see that she could not compete successfully
                        with the fertile South and West in agriculture, and hence she betook herself
                        to manufactures. We are somewhat (though in a less degree) in the same
                        situation, and we would act wisely to follow her example in devoting a large
                        part of our labour to mechanical pursuits.</p>
                    <p>Who will start the broom factory?</p>

<b>Disfranchisement of the South</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Argues that President Johnson should issue a proclamation of general
                    amnesty, circumventing the "Radicals'" cries of "'disloyalty'" among

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In the House of Representatives, Mr. Shellabarger of Ohio, offered a
                        resolution, which was agreed to "directing the Judiciary Committee to
                        inquire and report to the House on the constitutionality and prosperity of
                        providing by law that no person who is disloyal to the Government of the
                        United States, and who has voluntarily engaged in rebellion against such
                        Government, shall be entitled to exercise the right of an elector in any
                        State, or to hold office under such Government during such disloyalty; also,
                        by law, for persons who have so engaged in such rebellion being admitted to
                        exercise such elective franchise on proof of loyalty to the Government."</p>
                    <p>This resolution, says the N. Y. News, is in the
                        spirit of many others that have preceded it, aiming to legislate a
                        legitimate authority out of the hands of the President, and to render the
                        Southern people dependent upon the will of the Radicals in Congress for the
                        exercise of their rights as American citizens. It is about time that the
                        question should be determined whether a faction having numerical supremacy
                        in the National Legislature can dictate at their caprice what shall be the
                        political status of States and individuals, that were born to Republicanism
                        and inherited the inalienable rights of freemen. If self-government is a
                        privilege to be accorded or to be withheld at the pleasure of a majority in
                        Congress, there is nothing definite nor certain in our political system. Let
                        is be established that Congress has the power to take away elective
                        franchise from those who fail to adopt the doctrines of the dominant party,
                        and the worst form of despotism or anarchy takes the place of our boasted
                        Republicanism. We admit that those who engaged in armed hostility to the
                        Federal Government may be brought to trial before the tribunal empowered by
                        the Constitution to pronounce upon such offences: and if proven guilty,
                        there may, in a strict letter of the law, be some kind of barbarous and
                        sanguinary justice in making them pay the forfeit as written in the
                        statutes. But no law, no sentiment expressed or intimated in the
                        Constitution no acknowledged in our form of government gives to Congress an
                        authority to snatch the elective franchise from the hands of an American
                        citizen.</p>
                    <p>It is time that the word "disloyal," that is so often used in these Radical
                        resolutions, should be dropped from the parliamentary vocabulary. It has no
                        present application to any class of our people unless it be to the
                        demagogues who are continually mouthing it to carry their point against
                        their Southern countrymen. But the surest way to compel the Radicals to
                        accept the fact of Southern "loyalty" is for the President to proclaim a
                        general amnesty. His right to do so, under the Constitution, cannot be
                        questioned, and the present moment is most opportune for exercise of such an
                        act of clemency.--It will, of itself, restore the Southern people to all
                        their civil attributes, and will silence the revolutionary crew who are
                        incessantly p[unclear] of disloyalty in the very face of abundant testimony
                        to complete submission to the Federal authority. That is the simplest way to
                        settle the issue, and we appeal to the Executive to lose no time in his
                        application of so sovereign a remedy.</p>
