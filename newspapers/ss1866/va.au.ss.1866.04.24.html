<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Monday, the 16th inst., the negroes in Norfolk, Va., celebrated the
                        passage of the Civil Rights Bill by marching in procession, armed with
                        muskets, pistols, knives and clubs. A white man named J. L. R. Baker, a
                        "jackleg, miscegenating yankee lawyer," occupied a conspicuous position,
                        riding in a carriage in front of the procession with two negro women. As
                        might have been expected, this demonstration resulted in bloodshed. The
                        negroes shot and killed two white men, a woman and child.</p>
                    <p>The negroes generally behave themselves very well except where they are
                        incited to mischief and crime some one or more mean and low white men, who,
                        whilst pretending to the negroes to be their best friends, are, in fact,
                        their worst enemies. Such wicked creatures should be hung, and the negroes
                        should adjust the rope about their necks. They care nothing for the negroes,
                        and profess a very zealous friendship with the selfish motive of making
                        catpaws of them to subserve their own purposes. They smile upon the negroes,
                        whisper friendly expressions in their ears, and then use them as the monkey
                        did the cast. Every treacherous white man of this character should have his
                        neck stretched by the negroes they propose to dupe.</p>

<b>Their Folly is Consummated</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>

                    "will cause our Nation to reel to and fro--as a drunken man" and that "our land
