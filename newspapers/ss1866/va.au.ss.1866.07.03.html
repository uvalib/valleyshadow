<b>Public Meeting in Augusta--Important Resolutions</b><br> (Column 05)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Resolutions propounded by a public meeting at the court house on June 26,
                    denouncing the course of Congress, praising President Johnson, and vowing that

                    giving consent to her own degradation and dishonor."<br>(Names in announcement:  Alex. H. H. Stuart,  J. Marshall McCue,  William WithrowJr.,  John Merritt,  J. G. Fulton,  Thos. J. Michie,  Wm. M. Tate)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>At a meeting of the people of Augusta, held at the Court House of the County,
                        on June 26th (Court day) -- on motion of Hon. Alex. H. H. Stuart, J.
                        Marshall McCue, Esq., was called to the Chair, and Wm. Withrow, Jr.
                        appointed Secretary.</p>
                    <p>The Hon. A. H. H. Stuart, in a speech of great ability, explained the object
                        of the meeting.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stuart moved the appointment of a committee, and submitted some remarks
                        which were substantially as follows:</p>
                    <p>It having been made known to the public, through official channels, that the
                        body of men now assembled in Washington, and which claims to be the Congress
                        of the United States, had adopted an article, proposing several important
                        amendments to the Constitution of the United States, which they have caused
                        to be communicated to the authorities of the several States, for
                        ratification and adoption, as part of the organic law, we, the people of
                        Augusta county, Virginia, feel that it is alike our right and our duty to
                        assemble, at our Court House, in public meeting, and express our earnest and
                        deliberate protest against this action of the so-called Congress.</p>
                    <p>we maintain that the body to which we refer is not organized in conformity to
                        the letter or spirit of the Constitution, but in derogation of both, an is,
                        in no just sense, a Congress of the United States.</p>
                    <p>The Constitution, Art. I, Sec. 1st, provides, that "All legislative powers
                        herein granted, shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which
                        shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives."</p>
                    <p>The Constitution then prescribes the mode in which these two bodies shall be
                        organized.</p>
                    <p>"The House of Representatives shall be composed of members chosen, every
                        second years, by the people of the several States" -- Art. I., Sec. 2, Cause
                        1.</p>
                    <p>The fifth article of the Constitution, which prescribes the mode of altering
                        and amending the Constitution, provides that it shall not be competent, even
                        by amendment to the Constitution, to deprive a State of its equal
                        representation in the Senate. The clause is in these words, "no State,
                        without its consent, shall deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate."</p>
                    <p>In view of these plain requirements of the Constitution, we have no
                        hesitation in expressing our conviction that the body now assembled in
                        Washington, and from which the representation of eleven States of the Union
                        are excluded, and by which those eleven States are deprived, not only of
                        equal, but of all suffrage in the Senate has no
                        just claim to be recognized as the Congress of the United States.</p>
                    <p>We maintain, further, that the unworthy device to which that body has
                        resorted, under the name of a "concurrent resolution" is a mere subterfuge,
                        to evade a plain provision of the Constitution which requires, (Art. I, Sec.
                        7, Clause 3,) that every order, resolution or vote, to which the concurrence
                        of the SEnate and House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a
                        question of adjournment,) shall be presented to the President of the United
                        States, and, before the same shall take effect shall be approved by him, or
                        being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two-thirds of the Senate and
                        House of Representatives, according to the rules and limitations prescribed
                        in the case of a bill.</p>
                    <p>Notwithstanding this imperative mandate of the Constitution, the President,
                        in his recent message, has informed the Country that the resolution of
                        Congress, above referred to, was not submitted to him for his approval.</p>
                    <p>If an evasion like this be tolerated, an important provision of the
                        Constitution will become a dead letter -- the Executive will be stripped of
                        one of his most important prerogatives, and the people deprived of an
                        indispensable safeguard of liberty.</p>
                    <p>The amendments which are proposed to be incorporated into the Constitution,
                        are worthy of the source from which they emanated.--Stripped of the flimsy
                        disguise by which their deformity is sought to be concealed, they are
                        substantially:</p>
                    <p>1st. Negro equality in all respects.</p>
                    <p>2nd. The disfranchisement of every Southern man, who obeyed the authority of
                        his State and proved loyal to the instincts of humanity.</p>
                    <p>To the third amendment we can have no objection, except that it is
                        unnecessary and tend to mislead the public mind; because it was well known
                        to the authors of this amendment, that the several States had anticipated
                        their action, by adopting efficient measures to prevent the assumption or
                        payment of any debt contracted in aid of the war.</p>
                    <p>To the other two amendments we are inflexibly opposed. They involve flagrant
                        violations of the reserved rights of the States; tend to inflame sectional
                        animosity and to retard the restoration of union and harmony in the Country,
                        and were manifestly intended to degrade and humiliate the people of the
                        South.</p>
                    <p>We, therefore, indignantly protest against their adoption, as leading
                        inevitably to new troubles, and to the disturbances of the just revelations
                        between the States and the Federal government, and ultimately to the
                        consolidation of all power in the government of the United States; and we
                        earnestly invite the people of our sister counties, and all of the Southern
                        States, to assemble promptly, at their respective Court Houses, and
                        pronounce a similar judgement of condemnation of this mischievous attempt to
                        undermine the Foundation of Constitutional liberty.</p>
                    <p>As for ourselves, we could not sanction any such amendment without personal
                        dishonor, and the basest ingratitude and injustice to those of our fellow
                        citizens who merit the largest share of our esteem and confidence.</p>
                    <p>We prefer not to be represented at all, in the National Councils, rather than
                        to be represented only by those whose past history gives no assurances that
                        they will be true to their trusts.</p>
                    <p>We are determined, at all hazards, to maintain our self-respect unimpaired,
                        and therefore we must withhold our sanction from measures which necessity
                        involve a sacrifice of high moral principle.</p>
                    <p>We have been overwhelmed, but not yet been degraded. That can be done only
                        with our own consent, and that consent never will be given.</p>
                    <p>Our rights may be ravished from us by violence, but we will never agree that
                        Virginia shall be placed in the position of a political prostitute, by
                        giving consent to her own degradation and dishonor.</p>
                    <p>Whereupon, on motion a committee of five persons were appointed to report
                        resolutions for the meeting.</p>
                    <p>The following were appointed, Hon. A. H. H. Stuart, John Meritt, J. G.
                        Fulton, Thos. J. Michie, and Wm. M. Tate.</p>
                    <p>On motion, the meeting adjourned to half-past 3 o'clock.</p>
                    <p>At half-past 3 o'clock, the meeting resumed business, and the following
                        preamble and resolutions were reported, and on motion, as the sense of the
                        meeting, unanimously adopted.</p>
                    <p>Whereas, on the 8th day of May, 1865, the people of Augusta, in general
                        meeting, assembled "to take measures looking to a re-organization of the
                        government of Virginia in conformity to the Constitution of the United
                        States," with a just appreciation of the duties enforced on them by the
                        results of the war, and of the rights guaranteed to them by the Constitution
                        of the United States, pledge themselves, in good faith, to co-operate with
                        others for the restoration of the Union; and announcement principles and
                        opinions which have since been sanctioned and illustrated by the acts and
                        declarations of Andrew Johnson, the President of the United States; and,
                        whereas, the people of Virginia have sincerely, and in good faith, resumed
                        their relations to the Union, with the approval of the Executive, and the
                        recognition of the judiciary department of the Government of the United
                        States, and have been and are discharging, with scrupulous fidelity, the
                        duties of citizens, obeying the laws, paying taxes, and bearing other
                        burdens of Government; and, whereas, notwithstanding, that the right of
                        taxation has heretofore been deemed, inseparable from the right of
                        representation, the Congress of the United States in the absence of Senators
                        and Representatives from the eleven States of the Union, propose
                        deliberately to continue the imposition of taxes on the people of the South,
                        without their consent or voice in the enactment of laws for the purpose; and
                        not only so, but against the protestations of the President and the judgment
                        of the President and the judgment of all just men, to propose, for
                        ratification by the States, amendments of the Constitution of the United
                        States, which never could have been matured and passed, if all the States
                        had been in Congress by their representatives; and not this only, but, as is
                        alleged, looking upon the Union as dissolved in fact, as to the eleven
                        Southern States, and upon these as States still out of the Union, the said
                        Congress propose, that the ratification of the amendment recently
                        propounded, through the Secretary of State, not by an "act of Congress," to
                        which the approval of the President would have been necessary, but by a
                        "concurrent resolution" to avoid the effects on the country of a vote of the
                        act -- that the ratification of this amendment, so devised and propounded,
                        by each of the eleven Southern States shall be a condition precedent to the
                        restoration of the Union -- and, whereas, apart from the fact that said
                        amendment was passed by the two houses of Congress in violation of the
                        Constitution itself; and, apart from all else, in the article propounded,
                        unjust and oppressive to the people of the South, Virginians can never
                        ratify, without self-imposed dishonor and degradation, an amendment of the
                        Constitution which, notwithstanding professions of sincere loyalty, and acts
                        of patriotism, the President's pardon, and the rights of persons elsewhere
                        guaranteed in the Constitution, seeks to degrade and disfranchise the ablest
                        and purest men of the State fort the discharge of the duties imposed on them
                        by the suffrage of the people, or for sympathy and co-operation, during the
                        recent struggle, with an overwhelming majority of the people of Virginia;
                        and, whereas, whilst it is the unalterable purpose of the people of Augusta
                        county, to obey the laws, to bear patiently the burdens of Government, even
                        though denied the right of representation, and cordially to sustain the wise
                        and patriotic policy of the President of the United States, it is as equally
                        their fixed determination, to take part in no act which will deprive them of
                        a proud sense of self-respect or bring shame upon them and their posterity.</p>
                    <p>
                        Thereupon be it resolved.
                    </p>
                    <p>1. That the people of Augusta County cannot too warmly express their
                        gratitude that God placed in power, as President of the United States, a
                        citizen who, having the wisdom to discern, has the moral courage to act upon
                        principles, which a people, who love liberty and appreciate the
                        Constitution, must sooner or later sanction and adopt.</p>
                    <p>2. That, whilst we recognize our duty as good citizens to obey the laws, and
                        to bear the burdens of the Government -- as freemen we enter our earnest
                        protest against the violation through us, of the fundamental principles of
                        free Government evinced by the refusal of the two houses of Congress to
                        admit our Senators and Representatives to vote for or against the taxes we
                        are to pay, the burden we are to bear, and constitutional amendments to be
                        propounded to the States for their ratification.</p>
                    <p>3. That the people of Augusta can never authorize their Senator and delegates
                        in the General Assembly to vote for the article of amendment to the
                        Constitution of the United States propounded, as before stated, by the two
                        houses of Congress; and that in their opinion, it is far better for Virginia
                        to maintain her position, as a State out of the Union,
                            and at the same time discharge the duties of a State in the
                        Union, than to enter the Halls of Congress with the brand of
                        self-imposed degradation upon her brow and the object of the just scorn of
                        mankind; and that therefore it is the fixed purpose of the people, without
                        passion or excitement, and with no view to disturb the order or harmony of
                        the country, to decline even to consider any proposed amendments of the
                        Constitution until, to use the words of President Johnson in his recent
                        message to Congress, "after the admission of
                        such loyal Senators and Representatives of the now unrepresented States as
                        have been or may hereafter be chosen in conformity with the Constitution and
                        laws of the United States."</p>
                    <p>4. That the people of Augusta are prepared patiently to await the results of
                        the contest, now to be waged between the friends and the enemies of the
                        conservative principles of free government in the North, and for the time
                        when those who hold the power now shall be removed from the public trusts
                        they have abused; and in the meantime by such means as are left them, by
                        their cordial approval and their prayers, they will endeavor to uphold the
                        hands of Andrew Johnson, the great leader of their deliverance, as from his
                        high eminence, he looked upon and directs the struggle which must result
                        either in a revolution not only in the forms of Government, but in the
                        principles of the Constitution itself, or in the vindication of its ancient
                        doctrines and the consequent prosperity and Union of the States.</p>
                    <p>5. That the people of the other counties of Virginia, and of our sister
                        States, be requested to hold public meetings and unite with us in
                        endeavoring to defeat the proposed amendment.</p>
                    <p>6. That the newspapers of Staunton and Richmond, and other towns of the
                        State, be requested to publish the proceedings of this meeting and that a
                        copy of the same be sent to the National Intelligencer.</p>
                    <p>On motion the meeting adjourned.</p>
                    <p>J. MARSHALL McCUE, Chairman.</p>
                    <p>Wm. Withrow, Secretary.</p>

<b>Public Meeting--Constitutional Amendments</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Praises the individuals who attended a recent public meeting at the Court
                    House for refusing "to give their consent to such outrages" as those embodied in
                    the Constitutional Amendments. The people of the South can bear the deprivation
                    of their Constitutional rights with "philosophic fortitude," but they will
                    "maintain their honor inviolate, for that cannot be sullied without their
                    consent."<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Several weeks since, we published the amendments to the Constitution of the
                        United STates passed by two-thirds of the present Congress, so-called, and
                        therefore need not, at this time, as they have been read and studied by our
                        readers. They will be submitted to the Legislatures of the States for
                        ratification or rejection. The people of this county, who have the sagacity
                        to discern the character of important questions affecting their interests or
                        honor and the independent spirit to speak their sentiments freely, held a
                        public meeting in the Court House on Monday, (court day), June the 25th, and
                        adopted preamble and resolutions expressive of their indignant protest
                        against the adoption, by the Legislature of Virginia, of the proposed
                        amendments, and affirmed, in the language of one of the resolutions, that,
                        in their opinion, it was far better for Virginia to maintain her position,
                        as a State out of the Union, and at the same time
                            discharge the duties of a State in the Union, than to enter the
                        Halls of Congress with the brand of self-imposed degradation upon her brow,
                        and the object of the just scorn of mankind; and that therefore it was the
                        fixed purposes of the people, without passion or excitement, and with no
                        view to disturb the order of harmony of the country, to decline even to
                        consider any proposed amendments of the Constitution until, to use the words
                        of President Johnson in his recent message to Congress, "after the admission of such loyal Senators and
                        Representatives of the now unrepresented States as have been or may
                        hereafter be chosen in conformity with the Constitution and laws of the
                        United States."</p>
                    <p>Our people may have their constitutional rights unjustly withheld from them,
                        or ruthlessly violated and trampled upon, when they have not the power to
                        prevent it, but in this there is no dishonor as it is without their consent,
                        and they can bear it with philosophic fortitude, but they cannot be coerced
                        or seduced to give their consent to such outrages, for in that which they
                        prize more highly than life itself. The people of Virginia have the power
                        and will maintain their honor inviolate, for that cannot be sullied without
                        their consent.</p>
                    <p>We invite attention to the proceedings of the meeting referred to, found on
                        the first page of this paper.</p>
                    <p>We hope that the people of every county in the State will hold similar
                        meetings, and speak, in thunderous tones, their indignant protest against
                        the adoption of the proposed amendment.</p>
