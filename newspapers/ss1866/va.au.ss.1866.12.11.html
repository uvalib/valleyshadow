<b>The President's Message</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Praises President Johnson's Message for his refusal "to modify the policy
                    he has heretofore advocated" but takes issue with one of Johnson's statements,
                    which the editor believes implies that Congress has the authority to impose
                    additional, extra-Constitutional qualifications for members of Congress.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We publish on the first page a correct and full copy of the President's
                        Message. Such a have been expecting the President to modify the policy he
                        has heretofore advocated will be disappointed. He stands steadfast, and
                        exhibits "no variableness or shadow of turning." It is a calm document, very
                        unlike the speeches he delivered in his tour to and from the West some time
                        since, when he poured, in rapid succession, volleys of hot-shot into the
                        serried ranks of the Radicals. The argument in the message for the admission
                        of Southern Representatives is lucid, strong and conclusive. The message
                        concedes, however, a qualification to which we cannot assent. It says that
                        to be admitted to a seat of Representative should possess the "requisite
                        constitutional and legal qualifications" such as Congress may see proper to
                        impose, we dissent in toto from the position, for, as we have demonstrated
                        time and again, the Constitution prescribes the qualifications required, and
                        these cannot be added to or subtracted from without violating the
                        Constitution itself. The qualifications which Constitution prescribes should
                        be possessed by members of the House of Representatives are as follows: That
                        he should be twenty-five years of age, that he should have been seven years
                        a citizen of the United States, and an inhabitant, when elected, of the
                        State in which he was chosen. These are the only qualifications prescribed
                        by the Constitution.</p>
                    <p>If Congress has the right to add to these qualifications, no limit can be
                        prescribed, and that body may impose such as may suit their purposes, as
                        they have already attempted to do by requiring Representatives to take the
                        test oath. The imposition of such a qualification destroys representation,
                        and makes it impossible for the Southern people to be represented in the councils of the nation, and frustrates the
                        very object designed to be accomplished by the election of persons for that
                        purpose. With this qualification of our approbation of the President's
                        Message we give the comments of the National
                            Intelligencer as follows:</p>
                    <p>The President adheres to his oft-expressed conviction that loyal
                        representatives should be promptly admitted to their seats in both Houses.
                        His argument in favor of that policy is clear, condensed, and, in our
                        judgment, irresistible. He shows that all these branches of the Government
                        -- the executive, legislative, and judicial -- are unmistakably committed to
                        the doctrine that the Southern States are in the Union, have never been out,
                        and are entitled to representation. But neither now or at any other time
                        does he wish to dictate in Congress their duty. The most distempered
                        partisans cannot deny that the message, in its broad, catholic, patriotic
                        spirit, is the freest possible from any attempt at dictation or undue
                        interference with the other branches of the Government. But the Executive
                        puts the responsibility of non-restoration where it belongs. The Supreme
                        Court has done its duty in restoring the old cases to their docket and in
                        welcoming new ones. The Executive has done its duty in preserving order in
                        the South, and in announcing to those citizens who wished to return to their
                        allegiance that every facility should be given them to reconstruct their
                        Government. It only remains for Congress to complete the work, by welcoming
                        unobjectionable Representatives to the floor of both Houses. Nothing could
                        be said with more terse, convincing, and comprehensive vigor that the
                        passage which sums up what would be the most gratifying results of the
                        prompt concessions to the South of its constitutional rights.</p>
                    <p>As to the other features of the message, they cannot fail to commend
                        themselves to the popular judgment. They are marked by such vigorous common
                        sense, such a clear comprehension of the rights and responsibilities of this
                        great nation, such moderation and independence as will, we doubt not,
                        command a wide-spread approval among patriotic Americans of all classes.</p>
                    <p>The statement that is given of the resources and industrial condition of the
                        country, will be read with pride by every citizen of this great Republic.
                        Despite the vast debt accumulated by our great struggle, the nation, after
                        the strain of war, springs forward anew in its course of unexampled
                        prosperity, and is already beginning to pay off its liabilities. What is
                        said about the Alabama claims and the Fenian movement, and the right of
                        citizenship, will prove universally acceptable; but, perhaps, no portion of
                        the message will be read with greater interest than that which treats of our
                        relations with Mexico. In this regard, despite the rumors with which the air
                        is thick, it is found that the Government has acted wisely and with
                        statesman-like foresight and dignity.</p>
