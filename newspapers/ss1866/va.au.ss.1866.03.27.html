<b>Grape Culture</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor praises the move to grape cultivation in the county, an
                    enterprise that "will give profitable employment to many who are unfit for more
                    laborious pursuits."<br>(Names in announcement:   Kline,   Beard)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We are gratified to learn that many of our citizens are beginning to turn
                        their attention to this profitable branch of industry. Our country is
                        peculiarly adapted to the growth of the vine and the culture will give
                        profitable employment to many who are unfit for more laborious pursuits.</p>
                    <p>We have been informed that our enterprising fellow-citizen, Mr. Kline, a
                        German, who is familiar with vine culture, and wine-making, had bought a
                        small tract of land about five miles, southwest of Staunton, and will, this
                        spring, set out ten thousand vines. Other gentlemen are also, making their
                        arrangements to go into the business.</p>
                    <p>From all we can learn on the subject, we are inclined to believe there is no
                        crop which will yield so large a profit as the grape. We saw a letter
                        recently from an intelligent gentleman of Pittsylvania, in which it was
                        stated that the grapes from a single acre in that county last year yielded
                        $900. From other sources, we learn that from $400 to $500 per acre may be
                        confidently relied on. This is a larger return than the best cotton sugar
                        lands of the South over yield, and the labor of cultivation is much less.</p>
                    <p>In the present disorganized conditions of our labor system, it behooves our
                        people to diversify their pursuits, so as to meet the exigencies of the
                        times. Orchards and vineyards furnish the means, to small farmers, of
                        greatly improving their condition. We should be pleased, therefore, to see
                        every farmer set apart a few acres of his land for apples, pears, peaches
                        and grapes. Five acres thus applied, would yield more clear profit than a
                        good sized farm, cultivated in the ordinary war.</p>
                    <p>Grape vines begin to bear the second year after the roots are puts in the
                        ground. Roots can be bought at from $50 to $100 per thousand. The
                        cultivation does not require as much labor as corn, and when the crop is
                        ripe, women and children can gather it.</p>
                    <p>It would not be expedient for every one to attempt to make wine, because that
                        requires skill and experience. Most farmers should sell the grapes, or the
                        juice, and let those skilled in the processes of wine making, prepare it for
                        market.</p>
                    <p>One great advantage of the grape crop, is its certainty. It never fails in
                        this part of the country. We heard a gentleman, who has had some experience
                        in managing grape vines, say he had never known his grape crop to fail in
                        fifty years.</p>
                    <p>No apprehension need be felt about the want of a market. If our people will
                        only produce the grapes in quantities to justify persons skilled in making
                        wine to come among us, we shall certainly have them; and if they should not
                        come, the crude juice can be barreled up and sent to one of our cities,
                        where it will always command a high price -- say, from $2.00 to $3.50 per
                        gallon.</p>
                    <p>In the neighborhood of Cincinnati, under the auspices of Mr. Langworth, the
                        grape and wine business have been greatly extended, and is a source of very
                        large profit.</p>
                    <p>We are not sufficiently acquainted with the subject, to give detailed
                        instructions for either the planning or the culture; but we have been
                        informed that a light, gravely soil is the best. The ground should be well
                        broken up, and properly manured, and kept clean as a corn field with the
                        plough and hoe. It is also advisable, in planting, to put some fragments of
                        bones, cuttings of leather, or old shoes and rags, about the roots. These
                        gradually decompose, and furnish the proper aliment to the vines.</p>
                    <p>Any one desirous of going into the business, can readily obtain information
                        of the subject by referring to the March number of the farmer, or by enquiry
                        to some of their neighbors, who have had experience. We have no doubt Mr.
                        Kline would take pleasure in instructing any one who will apply to him.</p>
                    <p>Now is the time to begin operations. The vines should be set out during the
                        month of April.</p>
                    <p>In two or three years they will begin to bear. As time is so important in
                        pushing forward this business, all who propose to enter into it should do so
                        at once. The delay of a few weeks is equivalent to a postponement for a
                        year, because the planting season will have passed.</p>
                    <p>If there be any doubting Thomas among our readers, who requires the evidence
                        of his own senses to satisfy him of the advantages of the cultivation of
                        fruit-trees and vines, let him visit the farm of Mr. Beard, about seven
                        miles south west of Staunton on the Greenville road, and he can there have
                        the testimony of his own senses of seeing, touching, tasting and smelling,
                        to remove every lingering feeling of incredulity, Mr. Beard's farm was
                        originally one of the poorest and most unproductive in the county, and it
                        would have been impossible for him to maintain his family on it by th
                        ordinary system of farming. He had the good sense to see this, and turned
                        his attention to fruit trees and vines, and we doubt whether his farm does
                        not now yield as large a per cent. on the capital invested, and labor
                        employed as say in the county.</p>
                    <p>Why should not others follow his judicious example?</p>
