<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Charlottesville Chronicle</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>These terms, which are now used so frequently, are understood differently in
                        the NOrth and South. In the South, we mean by "reconstruction," the
                        establishment of the Union as it was before the
                        war, with the enjoyment of all th rights of guaranteed by the
                        Constitution. In the South, we mean by loyalty, cheerful obedience to the
                        Constitution of the United States and all laws passed in pursuance thereof.</p>
                    <p>In the North, different views are held; at least it is the ease with that
                        class which we denominate "Radicals." The Charlottesville (Va.) Chronicle well say, that "what these Northern
                        Radicals mean by 'reconstruction' is not the submission of the South to the
                        Federal authorities in good faith, but the submission
                            of the Southern mind to the Northern mind, both in its opinions and
                            feelings. They are not content to enslave the body; they wish to
                        enslave the soul. The man who differs from them
                        is a wretch that ought to be suppressed; and it is an inexcusable act of
                        moral turpitude for a man reared in Florida to say the weather is warm, when
                        it is cool in Massachusetts. As Massachusetts sees a proposition, so, for
                        the sake of the unity of the Puritan Empire, a Texas man must recognize
                        precisely the same outline.</p>
                    <p>"A well-reconstructed Southern man must also have satisfaction in pain --
                        when the loyal Northern man strikes him, he must experience a pleasurable
                        sensation. He must not wax sad over the desolation of the South, because
                        true loyalty does not care a button what becomes of the South, and is ever
                        radiant with joy at the aggregate result. True loyalty consists in the rough
                        selfishness and heartlessness. It forces negro suffrage on the helpless
                        inhabitants of the District, with the tyrannical remark that 'these people
                        in their hearts sympathized with the rebellion.' It would no more think of
                        allowing those negroes to migrate to the State of Vermont and vote, than the
                        wolf would think of giving its supper to the lamb. Loyalty is not concerned
                        a baubee whether the weight of a mountain is placed on th wasted, enfeebled
                        frame of the South, but it is alive with passion if a feather rests for a
                        moment on its own brawny shoulders. Loyalty has blasted the black man all
                        through the North, and denied him the most ordinary privileges; but it would
                        make a Jamaica of the South, with a little concern as a schoolboy cuts down
                        the monarch of the forest to get a squirrel. Loyalty heeds not the cry of
                        anguish that goes up from the South any more than the remorseless hounds
                        hear the sighs of the noble stag they have at last pulled down. Loyalty
                        regards the South as a legitimate field for the practice of and all
                        Massachusetts' theories just as atrocious criminals are given over to
                        surgeons and physicians for doubtful experiments.</p>
                    <p>"Loyalty is like the man who used to whip his slaves until he made them
                        laugh: it punishes, requires contrition, and then gladness.--For a rebel to become loyal, he must not say that he
                        submits to the arbitrament of the sword, and that he has ceased to love what
                        he loved before he felt it. Loyalty requires a boy who refuses to take
                        physic, to take it after being whipped -- but this is not all it insists on
                        -- the boy must like the physic. No Southern man is loyal, if he retain any
                        local attachments; he must contract a disgust for his ancestors, and snap
                        all the ties and associations of the past. Loyalty requires that any
                        prejudice against social equality with the negro must not be cherished at
                        the South, but is unblameworthy in Connecticut.</p>
                    <p>"We understand a 'reconstructed' Southern man, in the sense of Northern
                        Radicals, to mean that such a Southern man must become thoroughly abject in his nature, and go to Massachusetts for
                        opinions, as the devout Catholic seeks the confessor to get his religious
                        faith.--Until he undoes himself and believes
                        against his conscience -- no matter what his outward conduct -- he is still
                        in rebellion. War should carry conviction, as well as enforce submission.
                        War should prove, as well as over-master. If the surrender of General Lee
                        did not convince the people of Virginia that they were a race of scoundrels,
                        they need farther 'reconstruction.'"</p>

<b>A Bold Highway Robbery</b><br> (Column 05)<blockquote>

<b>Local News--A Few Words to Freedmen</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The author explains to freedmen that freedom does not consist of the use of
                    profane language. Instead, he counsels them to labor faithfully and quietly and
                    they will "receive good treatment."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It would seem from the conduct of some of the Freedmen of this place that
                        they suppose freedom consists in the use of profane language. It is quite a
                        common occurrence to hear them swearing upon the streets and they do it with
                        an air which seems to say, "I am free now and can swear like a sailor --
                        listen to my profane oaths -- they evince my freedom." These freedmen should
                        be taught that profane swearing, and the use of vulgar language should not
                        be allowed, and that freedom confers no such privileges as outrage good
                        behavior and decency.--If they would take our advice, we would counsel them
                        to act in such a manner as would secure for themselves in such manner as to
                        deserve it. If they will work instead of idling their time on the streets,
                        and will behave themselves properly instead of taking every opportunity to
                        assert their freedom by the use of profane and vulgar language, they will be
                        respected as they deserve and will receive good treatment; but if they
                        choose to make vagabonds of themselves, and to act the part of very mean and
                        low people, they cannot expect to command the respect, kindness and sympathy
                        of respectable and decent citizens. An industrious and well-behaved Freedman
                        can always get employment, and will always be well treated; but an idle,
                        ill-behaved one may expect to be an outcast -- no one will interest himself
                        in his behalf. He will be left to shift for himself.</p>

<b>Local News--No Use for Soldiers Here</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Argues that soldiers "caused disorder generally' when stationed in Staunton
                    and expresses the hope that they will not return.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In the list of places where garrisons of soldiers are to be established,
                        Staunton is not mentioned, from which we infer that there is no purpose, at
                        this time, to send any more soldiers here. We hope no garrison will be
                        established here, for there is no use for them of which we can conceive.
                        When soldiers were here, they rendered no service, but were the cause of a
                        great deal of disorder. They drank liquor, became intoxicated, used profane
                        language, maltreated the Freedmen, had difficulties with citizens, and
                        caused disorder generally. There was but little disposition, or great want
                        of ability, on the part of the officers, to restrain them and make them
                        behave themselves properly.--Since their departure, the order and quiet of
                        the town has been vastly improved. Such was the conduct of the soldiers,
                        that their presence was a cause of annoyance by day and of dread by
                    night.</p>
