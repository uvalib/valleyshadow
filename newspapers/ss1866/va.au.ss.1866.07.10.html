<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>There seems, says the Lynchburg Virginian, to be a very general concurrences
                        of opinion amongst men who are not incurably wedded to old party
                        organization, that a new National Administration party should be formed. The
                        country is in peril, and the parties that directly or indirectly reduced it
                        to its present extremity may not rescue it from the impending danger. The
                        democrats cannot do it; the Republicans will not. The one is impotent; th
                        other hopelessly corrupt. Each men claim their fair share of responsibility
                        for having contributed to th wreck and ruin of our once fair and stately
                        republic. But, we will forgive the Democrats if now, with true
                        self-abnegation, they will forego their efforts to save the republic
                        democratically and unite upon new men, under another and less obnoxious
                        name, to make common cause against the common enemy. Let the dead bury the
                        dead, whilst live men attend to the living issues that are upon them.</p>
                    <p>We have the testimony of one of the most distinguished Democrats in this
                        country, an ex-cabinet officer who has represented his country abroad --
                        that the Democratic party, with its war record, cannot succeed again in the
                        North. And this fact should be obvious to all who note the signs of the
                        times. Let us, therefore, taking the President's national policy and what is
                        left of State-rights and the Constitution, as the basis of our organization,
                        create a new national party that will be co-extensive with the Union. Whilst
                        we are individually willing to forego and abandon every prejudice of a
                        political character we ever imbibed, we are yet firmly convinced that a new
                        party is indispensable to the welfare of the country.</p>
                    <p>The President, who has taken a noble stand in defence of the Constitution and
                        republican government is in imminent danger of being overborne by a Radical
                        and revolutionary Congress, and all patriotic men should rush to the rescue.
                        Let us proceed at once with the organization.--There is no time to be
                    lost.</p>
