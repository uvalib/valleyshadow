                        Number of Citizens Killed! <br>Houses and Stores Plundered! <br>The Riot
                        Quelled!</p>
                    <p>On the 13th inst. a mob broke out in New York, ostensibly to resist the draft
                        about to be made, and for three days it defied the civil and military
                        authorities.</p>
                    <p>The several conscription offices were destroyed; the houses of the Mayor,
                        Post Master and many other building burned, and a number of citizens killed!
                        Every negro found on the street was brutally beaten and many fatally.</p>
                    <p>Gob. Seymour addressed the mob while rioting, plundering and murdering were
                        going on in several parts of the city, and assured them that he was their
                        friend--that they had been his friends. He assured them that he would stop
                        the draft and begged them in gingerly terms to go home. They did not go
                        however, nor did Seymour get the draft stopped, and after three days of the
                        most shameless parlaying with a mob, he was compelled to issue a third
                        proclamation declaring that the peace of the city must preserved at all
                        hazards.</p>
                    <p>The military were called out under the command of Gen. Brown, and in several
                        instances had to fire on the mob to disperse them. Col. O'Brien, of the
                        military, was most brutally murdered by the mob.</p>
                    <p>Thieves of every grade swelled the mob, and it finally became a mere
                        plundering horde. After three days it was completely mastered and order
                        reigns again in Gotham.</p>
                    <p>The government has given officlai [sic] notice that the draft will be made in
                        New York, and elsewhere without delay.</p>

<b>The Battle Of Gettysburg. A Full Account of the Three Days' Conflict</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Provides a detailed account of the three days of battle at Gettysburg.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>As a connected narrative of the memorable battles fought on Wednesday,
                        Thursday and Friday, the 1st, 2d and 3d of July, near Gettysburg, in Adams
                        county, Pennsylvania, will be valuable for reference, and also satisfactory
                        as a resume of the details furnished in our
                        despatches, we think the following carefully written account will be
                        acceptable to our readers.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Meade took command of this army on Sunday, the 28th ult. At that time
                        his headquarters were at Frederick, and Lee's at Hagerstown. It will be seen
                        that he was in the southwest, and consequently in the rear of the foe,
                        imminently threatening his line of retreat. The army of the Potomac began
                        its campaign from that moment. Orders were issued to the several corps to
                        move early in the evening, and on the morning of the 29th, our whole
                        brilliant and hopeful host was in motion towards Pennsylvania. The First,
                        Third and Eleventh corps encamped on Tuesday at Emmettsburg; the Second and
                        Twelfth also pitched their tents near by. The Sixth corps marched to
                        Carlisle Wednesday morning, the first day of this [illegible] forever
                        memorable. The First Corps, under Major-General Reynolds, and the Eleventh,
                        under Major-General Howard, started for Gettysburg. Reynolds in command,
                        where they arrived at 10 o'clock, a.m. The corps, in the advance, marched
                        directly through the town. The enemy was discovered posted in a wood to the
                        westward near the Lutheran Theological Seminary. The beginning of the three
                        days' conflict was at hand.</p>
                    <p>The Battle of Wednesday.</p>
                    <p>One who has been in the presence, who now sits among the echoes, and whose
                        brain teems with rushing memories of a conflict so recent and so vast, may
                        well pause before attempting to indicate its magnitude or describe its
                        progress. Rash as the advance of Gen. Reynolds has been pronounced by many
                        brother officers who now lament his death. I question whether it was not
                        after all for the best. It served at once as a roconnoissance, [sic] showing
                        the enemy's exact position and probable force, and as a check upon any
                        offensive movement which that enemy might have been intent upon. It secured
                        the Army of the Potomac the commanding position on Cemetery Hill, from which
                        the battles of the two succeeding days were chiefly fought, and which, had
                        the rebel commander anticipated the engagement, he would doubtless have
                        secured for himself. Not less, perhaps, than the skill of the generals who
                        directed the battle on our side, gave us the victory. When, therefore, the
                        heroic First Corps and and [sic] its fated commander placed themselves in
                        the terrible dilemma of Wednesday morning, they won a knowledge by their
                        sacrifice worth all the world to us thereafter. The corps marched in the
                        following order: First division, under Gen. Wadsworth; Third division, under
                        Gen. Doubleday; five fully batteries, under Col. Wainwright; Fourth
                        division, under Gen. Robinson.</p>
                    <p>A portion of our artillery took position half a mile south of the Seminary.
                        The enemy opened fire on it was such fierceness as forced the batteries to
                        retire, which they commenced doing in good order. Gen. Wadsworth immediately
                        came to their aid; two of his regiments, the 2d Wisconsin and the
                        Twenty-Fourth, Michigan charged the rebel infantry, forcing them to turn to
                        retire. The batteries assumed an excellent position further in the rear,
                        which they held during the day. Gen. Reynolds now rode forward to inspect
                        the field and ascertain the most favorable line for the disposal of his
                        troops. One or two members of his staff were with him. The enemy at that
                        instant poured in a cruel musketry fire upon the group of officers; a bullet
                        struck Gen. Reynolds in the neck, wounding him fatally. Crying out, with a
                        voice that thrilled the hearts of his soldiers, "Forward! For God's sake,
                        forward!" He turned for an instant, beheld the order obeyed by a line of
                        shouting infantry, and falling into the arms of Capt. Wilcos, his aid, who
                        rode beside him, his life went out with the words, "Good God, Wilcos, I am
                        killed."</p>
                    <p>The command of the corps devolved upon Gen. Doubleday, who hurried to the
                        front, placed it in position, and awaited a charge which it was seen the
                        rebels were about to make. An eminence whereon stood a piece of woods was
                        the important point thenceforth to be defended. The rebels advanced and
                        opened fire from their entire line. They were instantly charged upon by
                        Meredith's Western brigade, who without firing a shot, but with a tremendous
                        cheer, dashed forward with such swiftness as [illegible] found nearly 600 of
                        the feo, [sic] who were taken prisoner. A strong column immediately advanced
                        against us from the woods and, through volley after volley was pourded [sic]
                        into them did not waver. When proximity and strength at last became so
                        threatening that the brigades of the Second division were ordered to make
                        another charge, which was even more successful than the first. Their
                        momentum was like an avalanche; the rebels were shot, bayoneted, and driven
                        to partial retreat, more than two regiments falling into our hands alive.
                        Out ranks suffered fearfully in this demonstration, and it was evident that
                        such fighting could not long go on. The Eleventh corps now made its
                        appearance, and its General (Howard) assumed command of the forces.
                        Steinwehr was ordered to hold Gettysburg and Cemetery hill, all his
                        artillery being placed in the latter position. The other two divisions of
                        the Eleventh corps under Shultz and Barlow, then supported the First corps,
                        on the right in time to resist two desperate charges by Ewell's troops. A
                        third charge was now made by the entire rebel force in front, which
                        comprised the corps of Hill and Ewell, sixty-two thousand strong. The shock
                        was awful. The superior numbers of the foe enabled them to overlap both our
                        flanks, threatening us with surrounding and capture. Their main effort was
                        directed against our left wing and notwithstanding the gallant fighting done
                        by our soldiers at that point, they at last obtained such advantage that
                        Gen. Howard was forced to retire his command through the town to the east,
                        which was done in good order, the compliments of the rebels meanwhile
                        falling thick among it in the shape of shells, grape and canister. The two
                        corps were placed in line of battle on Cemetery Hill at evening, having
                        withstood during the entire day the assaults of an enemy outnumbering them
                        three to one. Not without grief, not without misgiving, did the officers and
                        soldiers of those corps contemplate the day's engagement and await the onset
                        they believed was to come. Their comrades lay in heaps beyond the village,
                        whose spires gleamed peacefully in the sunset before them. Reynolds the
                        beloved and the brave, was dead, and Zook slumbered beside him. D Barlow,
                        Paul, many field and scores of line officers had been killed. The men of the
                        First corps alone could in few instances turn to speak to the ones who stood
                        beside them in the morning without meeting a vacant space. The havoc in that
                        corps was so frightful as to decimate it fully one-half and that in the
                        Eleventh corps [illegible] last man. With what a thrill of relief Gen.
                        Howard, who had sent messenger after messenger during the day to Slocum and
                        Sickles, saw in the distance at evening the approaching bayonets of the
                        Third and Twelfth corps only then can tell who fought beside him. Those
                        corps arrived assumed positions to the right and left of the First and
                        Eleventh, on the heights about Cemetery Hill at dusk. The enemy made no
                        further demonstration that night. Gen. Meade and staff arrived before 11
                        o'clock. The commandeer then examined the position, and posted the several
                        corps in the following order: the Twelfth (Slocum) on the right the Eleventh
                        (Howard) next, the Second (Hancock) [illegible] (Doubleday) and
                        Third)Sickles) in the center, the Fifth (Sykes) and the [illegible] left.
                        The situation was brilliant commanding. For almost the first time in the
                        history of this army's career belonged the advantage in the [illegible]
                        battles which ensued.</p>
                    <p>The heights on which our troops were posted sloped gently downward from our
                        front. The line stretched in a semi-circle--its convex centre toward
                        Gettysburg, the [illegible] toward the southwest and south. Ledges on the
                        interior sides gave our soldiers in some instances a partial shelter from
                        artillery. Every road was commanded by our cannon, and the routes by which
                        Lee might otherwise soonest retreat in case of his defeat were all in our
                        possession. At every one weaker than others reserves were judiciously
                        posted, and the cavalry--an arm of the service scarcely brought into play in
                        some recent and destructive battles--protecting both our flanks in immense
                        numbers.</p>
                    <p>Thus the great army lay down to sleep at midnight and awoke on the morn of a
                        day more sanguinary than the last.</p>
                    <p>The Battle on Thursday.</p>
                    <p>On what spectacle the sun of Thursday rose, the memory of at least that
                        portion of our forces who witnessed it from Cemetery Hill will linger
                        forever. From its crest the muzzles of fifty cannon pointed toward the hills
                        beyond the town. From the bluffs to the right and left additional artillery
                        frowned, and away on either side, in a graceful and majestic curve,
                        thousands of infantry moved into battle line, their bayonets gleaming like
                        serpents' scales. The roofs of Gettysburg in the valley below, the rifs of
                        woodland along the borders of Rock creek, the orchards far down on the left,
                        the fields green and beautiful, in which the cattle were calmly grazing,
                        composed a scene of such peace as it appeared was never made to be marred by
                        the clangor of battle. I strolled out to the cemetery were the dew was yet
                        melted from the grass, and leaned against a monument to listen to the
                        singing of birds. One note, milder than the rest, had just broken from the
                        throat of an oriole in the foliage above me when the sullen rattle of
                        musketry on the left told that skirmishing had begun. Similar firing soon
                        opened along the entire rebel line, and although no notable demonstration
                        was made during the forenoon, it was apparent that the enemy was feeling our
                        strength preliminary to some decisive effort.</p>
                    <p>The day wore on full of anxious suspense. It was not until four o'clock in
                        the afternoon that the enemy gave voice in earnest.</p>
                    <p>He then began heavy fire on Cemetery Hill. It must not be thought that this
                        wrathful fire was unanswered. Our artillery began to play within a few
                        moments and hurled back defiance and like destruction upon the rebel lines.
                        Until six o'clock the road of cannon, the rush of missiles and the bursting
                        of bombs filled all the air. The [illegible] alone of this awful combat
                        might well have confused and awed a less cool and watchful commander than
                        General Meade. It did not confuse him. With the calculation of a tactician
                        and the eye of an experienced judge he watched from his headquarters on the
                        hill whatever movement under the murky cloud which enveloped the rebel lines
                        might first disclose the intention which it was evident this artillery
                        firing covered. About six o'clock p.m., silence, deep, awfully impressive,
                        but [illegible] was permitted as if by magic to dwell upon the field. Only
                        the groans unheard before of the wounded and dying, only the murmur --a
                        morning memory--of the breeze through the foliage, only the low rattle, of
                        preparation for what was to come, embroidered this black stillness. Then, as
                        the smoke beyond the village was lightly borne [illegible] the eastward, the
                        woods on the left were seen filled with dark masses of infantry, three
                        columns deeps, who advanced at a quickstep. Magnificent! Such a charge by
                        such a force--full 45,000 then, under Hill and Longstreet--even though it
                        threatened to pierce and annihilate the 3d Corps, against which it was
                        directed, drew forth cries of admiration from all who beheld it. General
                        Sickles and his splendid command withstood the shock with a determination
                        that checked, but could not fully restrain it. Back, inch by inch, fighting,
                        falling, dying, cheering, the men retired. The rebels came on more
                        furiously, halting at intervals, pouring volleys that struck our troops down
                        in scores.</p>
                    <p>General Sickles, fighting desperately, was struck in the leg and fell. The 2d
                        Corps come [sic] to the aid of his decimated column.--The battle then grew
                        fearful. Standing firmly up against the storm, our troops, though still
                        outnumbered , gave back shot for shot, volley for volley, almost death for
                        death. Still the enemy was not restrained. Down he came upon our left with a
                        momentum that nothing could check. The rifled guns that lay before our
                        infantry on a knoll were in danger of capture. Gen. Hancock was wounded in
                        the thigh, General Gibbon was wounded in the thigh, General Gibbon in the
                        shoulder. The 5th Corps, as the 1st and 2d wavered anew, went into the
                        breach with such shouts and such volleys as made the rebel column tremble at
                        last. Up from the valley behind, another battery came rolling to the heights
                        and flung its contents in an instant down in the midst of the enemy's ranks.
                        Crash! Crash! With discharges deafening, terrible, the musketry firing went
                        on; the enemy, reforming after each discharge with wondrous celerity and
                        firmness, still pressed up the declivity. What hideous carnage filled the
                        minutes between the appearance of the 5th Corps and the advance to the
                        support of the rebel columns of still another column from the right, I can
                        not bear to tell. Men fell as the leaves fall in autumn before those
                        horrible discharges.--Faltering for an instant, the rebel columns seemed
                        about to recede before the tempest. But their officers, who could be seen
                        through the smoke of the conflict galloping and swinging their swords along
                        the lines, rallied them anew, and the next instant the whole line sprang
                        forward as if to break through our own by mere weight of numbers. A division
                        from the 12th Corps from the right reached the scene at this instant, and at
                        the same time Sedgwick came up with the 6th corps, having finished a march
                        of nearly thirty-six consecutive hours. To what rescue they came, their
                        officers saw and told them. Weary as they were, bare-footed, hungry, fit to
                        drop for slumber as they were, the will for victory was so blended with the
                        thought of exhaustion that they [illegible] en
                        masse into line of battle, and went down on the enemy with death in
                        their weapons and cheers on their lips. The rebel camel's back was broken by
                        this "feather."--His line staggered, reeled, and drifted slowly back, while
                        the shouts of our soldiers lifed [sic] up amid the roar of musketry over the
                        bodies of the dead and wounded, proclaimed the completeness of their
                        victory. Meanwhile, as the division of Slocum's corps on the extreme right
                        left its post to join in this triumph, another column of the enemy under
                        command of Gen. Ewell, had dashed savagely against our weakened right wing,
                        and as the failure to turn our left became known it seemed as if
                        determination to conquer in this part of the field overcame alike the
                        enemy's fear of death and his plan for victory elsewhere. The fighting was
                        terrific, and for fifteen minutes the attack to which the three division of
                        the 12th Corps were subjected was more furious than anything every known in
                        the history of this army. The 6th corps came to their support, and 1st corps
                        followed; and from dusk into darkness, until half past nine o'clock, the
                        battle raged with varied fortune and unabated fury. Out troops were
                        compelled by overpowering numbers to fall back a short distance, abandoning
                        several rifle-pits and an advantageous position to the enemy, who, haughty
                        over his advantage and made desperate by defeat in other quarters, then made
                        a last struggling charge against that division of our right wing commanded
                        by Gen. Geary. General Gear's troops immortalized themselves by their
                        resistance to this attempt. They stood like adamant, a moveless,
                        death-dealing machine, before whose volleys the rebel columns withered and
                        went down by hundreds. After a slaughter inconceivable the repulse of Ewell
                        was complete, and he retired at ten o'clock p.m. to the position before
                        referred to. The firing from all quarters of the field ceased soon after
                        that hour, and no other attach was made until morning.</p>
                    <p>The Battle of Friday.</p>
                    <p>As one who stands in a tower and looks down upon a lengthy pageant marching
                        through a thoroughfare, finds it impossible at the close to recall in order
                        the appearances and the incidents of the scene, so I, who sit this evening
                        on a camp-stool beside the ruins of the monument against which I leaned
                        listening to the robin of yesterday, find it impossible to recall with
                        distinctness the details of the unparalleled battle just closed. The
                        conflict, waged by 160,000 men, which has occupied with scarcely an interval
                        of rest, the entire day, from 4 a.m. until 6 o'clock this evening, contains
                        so much, so near, and such voluminous matter of
                        interest as one mind cannot grasp without time for reflection.</p>
                    <p>The last engagement has been the fiercest and most sanguinary of the war. It
                        was begun at daylight by Gen. Slocum, whose troops, maddened by the loss of
                        many comrades, and eager to retrieve the position lost by them on the
                        preceding evening, advanced and delivered a destructive fire against the
                        rebels under Ewell. That general's entire force responded with a charge that
                        is memorable even beyond those made by them yesterday. It was desperation
                        against courage! The fire of the enemy was mingled with yells, pitched even
                        above its clangor. They came on, and on, and on, while the national troops,
                        splendidly handled and well posted, stood unshaken to receive them. The fire
                        with which they did receive them was so rapid and so thick as to envelope
                        the ranks of its deliverers with a pall that shut them from sight during the
                        battle which raged thenceforward for six dreary hours. Out of this pall no
                        straggler came to the rear. The line scarcely flinched from its position
                        during the entire conflict. Huge masses of rebel infantry threw themselves
                        into it again and again in vain. Back, as a ball hurled against a rock,
                        these masses recoiled, and were reformed to be hurled anew against it with a
                        fierceness unfruitful of success--fruitful of carnage as before. The strong
                        position occupied by Gen. Geary, and that held by Gen. Birney, met the first
                        and hardest assaults, but only fell back a short distance before fearful
                        odds, to re-advance, to re-assume and to hold their place in company with
                        Sykes' division of the Fifth corps and Humphrey's (Berry's old division) of
                        the Third, when, judiciously reinforced with artillery, they renewed and
                        continued the contest until its close. It seemed as if the gray- uniformed
                        troops, who were advanced and re-advanced by their officers up to the very
                        edge of the line of smoke in front of our infantry, were impelled by some
                        terror in their rear, which they were as unable to withstand as they were to
                        make headway against the fire in their front. It was hard to believe such
                        desperation voluntary. It was harder to believe that the courage which
                        withstood and defeated it was mortal.</p>
                    <p>The enemy gradually drew forward his whole line until in many places a hand
                        to hand conflict raged for minutes. His artillery, answered by ours, played
                        upon our column with frightful result, yet they did not waver. The battle
                        was in this way evenly contested for a time but at a time when it seemed
                        problematical which side would gain the victory, a reinforcement arrived and
                        were formed in line at such a position as to [illegible] the enemy and teach
                        him at last the futility of his efforts. Disordered, routed, and confused,
                        his whole force retreated, and at 11 o'clock the battle ceased and the
                        stillness of death ensued. The silence continued until 1 P.M. At this moment
                        the rebel artillery from all pointed, in a circle radiating around our own,
                        began a terrific and concentrated fire on Cemetery Hill, which was held, as
                        I have previously stated, by the Eleventh and Second corps. The flock or
                        pigeons, which not ten minutes previous had darkened the sky above were
                        scarcely thicker than the flock of horrible missiles that now, instead of
                        sailing harmlessly above, descended upon our position. The atmosphere was
                        thick with shot and shell. The storm broke upon us so suddenly that soldiers
                        and officers--who leaped, as it began, from their tents, or from lazy
                        siestas on the grass--were stricken in their rising with mortal wounds and
                        died, some with cigars between their teeth, some with pieces of food in
                        their fingers, and one at least--a pale young German, from
                        Pennsylvania--with a miniature of his sister in his hands, that seemed more
                        meet to grasp an artist's pencil than a musket. Horses fell, shrieking such
                        awful cries as Cooper told of, and writhing about in helpless agony. The
                        boards of fences, scattered by explosion, flew in splinters through the air.
                        The earth, torn, up in clouds, blinded the eyes of hurrying men; and through
                        the branches of the trees, and among the grave-stones of the cemetery a
                        shower of destruction crashed ceaselessly. As, with hundred of others, I
                        groped through this tempest of death for the shelter of the bluff, an old
                        man, a private in a company belonging to the 24th Michigan, was struck
                        scarcely ten feet away by a cannon ball, which tore through him, extorting
                        such a low, intense cry of mortal pain as I pray God I may never again hear.
                        The hill, which seemed alone devoted to this rain of death, was clear in
                        nearly all its unsheltered places within five minutes after the fire began.</p>
                    <p>Our batteries responded immediately.--Three hours of cannonading ensued,
                        exceeding in fierceness any ever known. Probably three hundred cannon were
                        fired simultaneously until 4 o'clock, when the rebel infantry were again
                        seen massing in the woods fronting our centre, formed by the First and
                        Second corps. Gen. Doubleday's troops met this charge with the same heroic
                        courage that had so often repelled the enemy in his desperate attempts. The
                        charge was made spiritedly, but less venomously than before. Gen.. Webb,
                        commanding the Second brigade, Second division of the Second corps, met the
                        main fury of the attack with a steady fire that served to retard the enemy's
                        advance for a moment. That moment was occupied by the rebel General
                        Armistead in steadying his troops behind the fence. Gen. Webb immediately
                        ordered a charge, which was made with such eagerness and swiftness, and
                        supported by such numbers of our troops, as enabled us to partially surround
                        the enemy, and capture Gen. Armistead and 3,000 of his men. The carnage
                        which accompanied this charge and the terror inspired by it were so great as
                        to reduce the foe to actual cowardice. They fell upon their knees and faces,
                        holding forward their guns and begging for mercy, while their escaped
                        comrades, panic-stricken and utterly routed rushed down across the ditches
                        and fences through the fields and through Gettysburg. Not a column remained
                        to make another start. The triumph fought for during these three terrible
                        days belonged at last to the noble Army of the Potomac.</p>
                    <p>Traces of the Struggle at the Cemetery.</p>
                    <p>Monuments and head-stones lie here and there overturned. Graves, once
                        carefully tended by some loving hand, have been trampled by horses feet
                        until the vestiges of verdure have disappeared. The neat and well-trained
                        shrubbery has vanished or is but a broken and withered mass of tangled
                        brush-wood. On one grave lies a dead artillery horse, fast decomposing under
                        the July sun. On another lie the torn garments of some wounded soldier,
                        stained and saturated with his blood. Across a small headstone, bearing the
                        words, "To the memory of our beloved child, Mary" lie the fragment of a
                        musket shattered by a cannon shot. In the centre of a space enclosed by an
                        iron fence, and containing a half dozen graves, a few rails are still
                        standing where they were erected by our soldiers and served to support the
                        shelter tents of a bivouacking squad. A family shaft has been broken in
                        fragment by a shell, and only the base remains, with a portion of the
                        inscription thereon. Stone after stone felt the effects of the feu d'enfer that was poured upon the crest of the
                        hill. Cannon thundered, and foot and horse soldiers trampled over the
                        sleeping place of the dead. Other dead were added to those who are resting
                        here, and many a wounded soldier still lives to remember the contest above
                        those silent graves.</p>
                    <p>Position of Cemetery Hill--Its Importance.</p>
                    <p>The hill on which this cemetery is located was the centre of our line of
                        battle and the key to the whole position. Had the rebels been able to carry
                        this point, they would have forced us into retreat, and the whole battle
                        would have been lost. To pierce our line here was Lee's great endeavor, and
                        he threw his best brigades against it. Wave after wave of living valor
                        rolled up that slope only to roll back again under the deadly fire of our
                        artillery and infantry. It was on this hill, a little to the right of the
                        cemetery where occurred the charge of the famous brigade of Louisiana
                        Tigers. It was their boast that they were never yet foiled in an attempt to
                        take a battery, but on this occasion they suffered a defeat and nearly
                        annihilation. Sad and dispirited they mourn their repulse and terrible
                        losses in the charge.</p>
                    <p>The Rebel Dead.</p>
                    <p>Retracing my steps, before reaching the extreme left, I returned to the
                        centre of our position, on the Cemetery Hill. I do not follow the path by
                        which I come, but take a route along the hollow, between the two ridges. It
                        was across this hollow that the charges were made in the assault upon our
                        position. Much blood was poured out between these two swells of land. Most
                        of the dead have been buried where they fell, or gathered in little clusters
                        beneath some spreading tree or beside clumps of bushes. Some of the rebel
                        dead are still uncovered. The first that meets my gaze I come upon suddenly,
                        as I descend a bank, some three or four feet in height, to the side of a
                        small spring. He is lying near the spring, as if he had crawled there to
                        obtain a draught of water. His hands are outspread upon the earth, and
                        clutching at the little tufts of grass beneath them. His haversack and
                        canteen are still hanging on him, and his hat is lying near him. His musket
                        is gone; either carried off by his comrades, [sic] taken by some relic
                        seeker, or placed in the accumulated heap by our own soldiers.</p>
                    <p>The body of another rebel attracts my attention by a singular circumstance.
                        The fact is discolored in the extreme, black as that of the purest Congo
                        negro. The hands are as delicate as those of a lady and of snowy whiteness.
                        With the exception of the face, the body is but little swollen, and there
                        are no signs of the commencement of decomposition. Several bodies that I
                        find show blackened faces, but no others than this display such a contrast
                        between the color of the face and hands. Near a small white house on the
                        rebel line lies the body of an officer, evidently a lieutenant or captain.
                        His right arm is extended as if to grasp the hand of a friend. All possible
                        positions in which a dying man can fall can be noticed on this field.</p>
                    <p>Shelling General Meade's Headquarters</p>
                    <p>The little farm house on the Emmettsburg road, where General Meade held his
                        headquarters during the cannonade is most fearfully cut up. It is already
                        known how Gen. Lee masked his artillery and opened with one hundred and
                        thirty pieces at the same moment. Two shells in every second of time fell
                        around those headquarters. The shells tore through the little white building
                        exploding and scattering their fragments in every direction. Not a spot
                        anywhere was safe. One shell through the doorstep, another in the chimney, a
                        third shattering a rafter, a fourth cutting off the legs of a chair in which
                        a staff officer was seated; other severed and splintered the posts in front
                        of the house, howled through the trees by which the dwelling was surrounded,
                        and raised deep furrows of the soft earth. At the fence in front of the
                        building the horses of aids and orderlies were standing. A dozen of the
                        frightened animal fell by the rebel projectiles, and other broke away and
                        fled in the wildest fright towards the rear. One staff officer, and another,
                        and another, were wounded. Strange to say, amid all this iron hail, no one
                        of the staff was killed. Every man stared death full in the face, and had
                        little prospect of escaping unhurt. Rarely in the history of war has there
                        been a scene to equal this.</p>
                    <p>Lee's Address to his Army.</p>
                    <p>Frederick, July 12, 1863.--The following general order of General R. E. Lee
                        to the Rebel army, issued from Hagerstown, on Saturday, was found when
                        General Kilpatrick entered the town on Sunday morning:</p>
                    <p>General Order--No. 16</p>
                    <p>Headquarters, Army of Northern Virginia, July 11, 1863.--After the long and
                        trying marches endured with the fortitude that has ever characterized the
                        soldiers of the Army of Northern Virginia, you have penetrated to the
                        country of our enemies, and recalled to the defense of their own soil those
                        who were engaged in the invasion of ours. You have fought a fierce and
                        sanguinary battle, which, if not attended with the
                            success that has hitherto crowned your efforts,  was marked by
                        the same heroic spirit that has commanded the respect of your enemies, the
                        gratitude of your country, and the admiration of mankind.</p>
                    <p>Once more you are called upon to meet the enemy from whom you have torn so
                        many fields, the names of which will never die. Once more the eyes of your
                        countrymen are turned upon you, and again do wives and sisters, fathers and
                        mothers, and helpless children, lean for defense on your strong arms and
                        brave hearts. Let every soldier remember that on his courage and fidelity
                        depends all that makes life worth having, the freedom of his country, the
                        honor of his people and the security of his home. Let each heart grow strong
                        in the remembrances of our glorious past, and in the thought of the
                        inestimable blessings for which we contend; and invoking the assistance of
                        that benign Power which has signally blessed our former efforts, let us go
                        forth in confidence to secure the peace and safety of our country. Soldiers,
                        your old enemy is before you. Win from him honor worth of your right cause;
                        worthy of your comrades dead on so many illustrious fields.</p>
                    <p>R. E. Lee, Gen. Com.</p>

                    <p>We take the following remarkable article from the Richmond Enquirer, of June 12th, in which the whole tribe of
                        Peace Sneaks, who are endeavoring to embarras [sic] the Government, and thus
                        give aid and comfort to the Rebels, are brought under the old-time
                        slave-driver's lash:</p>
                    <p>Two Years Hence.</p>
                    <p>In two years, as many persons hope, we may probably have peace--that is,
                        always provided we continue to repulse and defeat the invading enemy. The
                        Yankee "Democracy" is certainly arousing itself and preparing for a new
                        struggle (at the ballot box,) in the great cause of the
                            "spoils," or as they call it, the cause of Constitutional
                        Liberty. Those democrats are evidently beginning to raise a Peace platform for their next Presidential election, and
                        if they have the good luck to be helped on and sustained by more and more
                        serious disasters of the Yankee army in the field, there is no doubt that
                        the present devourers of the said spoils at Washington may soon be so
                        discredited and decried that our enemy's country would be ripe for such
                        peaceful ballot-box revolution.</p>
                    <p>It is sincerely to be hoped that those earnest champions of constitutional
                        freedom will be helped on and sustained in the manner they require--namely,
                        by continued and severe reverses in the field; and it is the first and most
                        urgent duty of our countrymen so to help and sustain the Democratic
                        party.--It is nothing to us which of their factions may devour the "spoils,"
                        just as little does it signify to us whether they recover or do not recover
                        that constitutional liberty which they so wantonly threw away in the mad
                        pursuit of Southern conquest and plunder. But it is of
                            the utmost importance to us to aid in stimulating disaffection among
                            Yankees against their own Government, and in demoralizing and
                            disintegrating society in that God-abandoned country! We can do
                        this only in one way--namely, by thrashing their armies and carrying the war
                        to their own firesides. Then, indeed, conscientious constitutional
                        principles will hold sway; peace platforms will look attractive; arbitrary
                        arrests will become odious, and habeas corpus be quoted at a premium. This
                        is the only way we can help them. In this sense, and to
                            this entent, [sic] those Democrats are truly our allies, and we shall
                            endeavor to do our duty by them.</p>
                    <p>But they evidently look for other and further help at our hands, and of quite
                        a different sort. No doubt they are pleased for the present, with the
                        efficient aid which the Confederate army is affording them. [illegible] was
                        a God-send to them, and the tremendous repulse at Port Hudson is quite a
                        plank in their platform. Yet they understand very well that no matter how
                        soundly their armies may be happily beaten; no matter how completely
                        Lincoln's present war policy may be condemned by its results, yet all this
                        will not be enough to enable the unterrified Democracy
                            to clutch the "spoils,"--or, as they phrase it, to restore the
                        Constitution of their fathers. This, of itself would never give them a
                        Peace-Democrat President and Cabinet; it would only result in another
                        Abolitionist administration with a New Secretary of War, and a new
                        Commander-in- Chief, and a slightly different programme for "crushing the
                        rebellion." Those Black Republicans are in power; after long waiting,
                        pining, intriguing in the cold shade of the opposition; and they have now
                        the numerical preponderance so decidedly that they both can and will hold on
                        to the offices with a clutch like death. The Democrats can do absolutely
                        nothing withont [sic] "the South," as they persist in terming these
                        Confederate States; and they cannot bring themselves to admit the thought that we would refused to united with them (as alas !
                            We used to do) in a grand Universal Presidential campaign, for a
                            Democratic President, with a Peace platform, and the "Constitution as it
                            is." In fact, this whole two years' war, and the two years' more
                        war which has yet to be gone through, is itself, in their eyes, only a
                        Presidential campaign, only somewhat more vivacious than ordinary.</p>
                    <p>This explains the Vallandigham Peace Meetings in New York and New Jersey and
                        the "manly declarations" of Mrs. Horatio Seymour and other patriots. "Do not
                        let us forget," said Fernando Wood, writing to the Philadelphia meeting,
                        "that those who perpetrate such outrages as the arrest and banishment of Mr.
                        Vallandigham, do so as necessary war measures. Let us, therefore, strike at
                        the cause and declare for peace and against the war."</p>
                    <p>This would sound very well if the said "declaring for peace" could have any
                        effect whatever in bringing about peace. If a man falling from a tower could
                        arrest his fall by declaring against it, then the declarations of Democrats
                        against the war might be of some avail. As it is, they resemble that
                        emphatic pronouncement of Mr. Washington Hunt: "Let it be proclaimed upon the housetops, that no citizen of New York
                        shall be arrested without process of law." There is no use of brawling from
                        the housetops what everybody knows to be nonsense. Or this resolution of the
                        New Jersey meeting:</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That in the illegal seizure and
                        banishment of the Hon. C. L. Vallandigham, the laws of our country have been
                        outraged, the name of United States disgraced, and the rights of every
                        citizen menaced, and that it is now the duty of a law respecting people to
                            demand of the Administration that it at once
                        and forever desist from such deeds of despotism and
                            crime. [Enthusiasm.]</p>
                    <p>Deman[illegible]? The starling that Mr. Sterne saw in the cage, said only "I
                        can't get out." It would have been more "manly" to scream, "I demand to get
                        out--I proclaim on the housetops that I will get
                        out."</p>
                    <p>Another of the New Jersey resolutions throws an instructive light upon this
                        whole movement, and its objects.</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That we renew our declaration of
                        attachment to the Union, pledging to its friends, wherever found out unwavering support, and to its enemies, in
                        whatever guise, our undying hostility, and that, God, willing, we will stand
                        by the Constitution and laws of our country, and under their sacred shield
                        will maintain and defend our liberty and rights, "peaceably if can forcibly
                        if we must." [Great cheering.]</p>
                    <p>This phrase, "wherever found," implies that there are friends of the union in
                        this Confederacy, and the resolution obligingly pledges to them the support
                        of the New Jersey Democracy--not surely without an equivalent return.</p>
                    <p>To the same meeting, Gen. Fitz John Porter writes a letter, declaring, of
                        course, for the Constitution and resistance to despotism, and ending thus:</p>
                    <p>"The contest of arms, however, will not be required; the certain and peaceful
                        remedy will be found in the ballot-box. Let us all possess our souls in
                        patience. The remedy is ours."</p>
                    <p>Gen. FitzJohn knows well that the remedy is not
                        theirs, unless "the South" consent to throw its votes into that same
                        ballot-box, and it is for this, and this only, that the Democratic book is
                        bated with "Peace." But in a speech of Senator Wall, of New Jersey, before a
                        Democratic Club of Philadelphia (which we find printed in The Sentinel,), is a passage more fully expounding
                        the Democratic plan than any other we have seen. He says:</p>
                    <p>Subjugation and annihilation being alike impossible, I am in favor of an
                        immediate cessation of hostilities, for an armistice--that amid the lull of
                        the strife the heat of passion shall have time to cool, and the calm,
                        majestic voice of reason can be heard. In the midst of such a calm I am for
                        endeavoring to learn from those in arms against us what their demands may
                        be, and inviting their co-operation in the name of a common humanity, to
                        some place of reconciliation or reconstruction, by which the sections may
                        united upon a more stable basis--a plan in which the questions upon which we
                        have differed so long may be harmoniously adjusted, and each section, by
                        virtue of the greatness developed in this war, may profit by the experience.
                        If it shall be found that sectional opinion and prejudices are too
                        obstinate, and the exasperations of this war have burnt too deep to settle
                        it upon the basis of reconciliation or reconstruction, then I know that
                        separation and reconstruction are inevitable."</p>
                    <p>Here is the whole plan; an armistice, and then "inviting our co-operation."
                        During that armistice they hope that the "calm, majestic voice of reason"
                        and a "common Christianity" might do something considerable.--The game, as
                        they calculate, would then be on the board, with stakes so tempting! Mr.
                        Wall would endeavor "to learn from us what our demands are."</p>
                    <p>Anything in reason he would be prepared to grant us; but if we replied, our
                        demands are, that you bring away your troops from every inch of our soil,
                        that you leave the Border States free to decide on their own destiny, that
                        you evacuate all our forts and towns which you now hold, and make us rid of
                        you and the whole breed of you forever, then Mr. Wall would exclaim, What!
                        do you call that the calm, majestic voice of reason? Is that your common
                        Christianity? He would say, when I spoke of the calm
                            majestic, &amp;c., I meant the spoils; when I said a common
                        Christianity, I meant money. Let us talk
                        rationally--how much common Christianity will you take?</p>
                    <p>In vain is a net spread in the sight of any bird. We are aware of them; and
                        we will watch them well, and the friends of the Union, "wheresoever found."
                            Our views go a little further than theirs--we hope
                            to so disorganize and disintegrate society in their country that they
                            will rush into armed revolution and anarchy. We spit upon their
                            ballot-box. We care not what they "demand" in resolutions, nor
                        what helpless trash they proclaim on the housetops. We do not believe in
                        their power to attain so much as an armistice for two years to come. It an
                        armistice, indeed, were offered, and the invading troops were withdrawn, of
                        course we should not object to it, and good use could be made of it.</p>
                    <p>But, mark well, ye armistice mongers: During that
                        suspension of hostilities all negotiations must be between Government and
                        Government. Our lines should be more strictly guarded than ever. No
                        negotiations or fraternization of parties by public meetings or private
                        conferences: no bargaining with the calm voice of
                            reason; no secret pocketing of Wall's "Common Christianity."</p>
                    <p>But armistice there will be none, and we are glad of it. Our sovereign
                        independence is already won and paid for with treasurers of brave blood.
                            It shall not be sold by peddlers to be built into a
                            Yankee platform.</p>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The popular disappointment at the retreat of Lee, with the remnant of his
                        army, across the Potomac with comparative safety, is keen and undisguised.
                        With many the unreasonable hope was cherished with confidence that Lee would
                        be utterly destroyed or captured; but with the more reflecting there
                        prevailed a conviction that Gen Meade would deliver battle with every chance
                        of success, and that the rebel hosts would be routed and practically
                        destroyed as an army.</p>
                    <p>It is possible that General Meade could have engaged Lee on Monday of last
                        week, and routed him. Certainly had he known how helpless Lee was just then,
                        with part of his artillery already across the river, the destruction of Lee
                        could have been attained. But Gen. Meade must not be judged and censured
                        rashly. A glance at the map given on our first page will show what an
                        herculean task he had to perform. It must be borne in mind, too, that Lee
                        had gained possession of the South Mountain passes from the Potomac up to
                        the Gettysburg turnpike, before Gen. Meade had command of the Army, and that
                        Lee's open line of retreat was in his own hands and beyond the power of
                        Meade to interrupt.</p>
                    <p>Lee commenced his retreat on Saturday morning, July 4th, of course presenting
                        a strong front to Meade until his artillery and baggage were safely out of
                        reach. He then withdrew his rear guard, leaving his dead and wounded to the
                        tender mercies of the Union commander. Lee had thus full twenty-four hours
                        start of Meade in his movement, and he was falling back toward his base and
                        shortening his lines, while the pursuit by Meade extended his lines and
                        involved immense transportation of provisions and ammunition over two
                        mountains and bad roads.</p>
                    <p>Lee had but to recross the South Mountain into Franklin county by the
                        Gettysburg and Monterey passes, and from thence had a straight line to the
                        river, reaching his new position in a march of thirty miles. On the other
                        hand Meade's army had been brought to Gettysburg by the most exhausting
                        forced marches, with the smallest possible amount of transportation, and the
                        very hour his troops reached there the engagement commenced, and for three
                        days it raged with the deadliest fury until full twenty thousand of his
                        gallant warriors were numbered with the dead, wounded and captured. Although
                        victorious in holding his position and utterly defeating and turning back
                        the rebel hordes under Lee, still the shock of that battle, with the dead
                        and wounded of both armies in his hands. Left his army in a sorry condition
                        for prompt pursuit. He did pursue, however, as rapidly as was possible to
                        move and supply his men; but he had to march nearly thirty miles to
                        Frederick, thence across the Catoctin and South mountains to Boonsboro,
                        nearly twenty miles more, and then found the rebel lines extending from
                        Shepperdstown to Williamsport, (as marked on the map by dotted lines) and
                        also covering Hagerstown. He promptly made reconnoisances from Boonsboro to
                        the Antietam, to Funkstown and Hagerstown, and Sedgwich compelled Lee to
                        retreat from the Shepperdstown ford and shorten his line immediately around
                        Williamsport.</p>
                    <p>The position thus chosen by Lee was one of singular strength naturally, and
                        was fortified so as to make it almost impregnable. Meade might have attacked it successfully on Sunday, but at a
                        sacrifice of nearly two of his brave veterans to one of the enemy; and even
                        if successful in driving Lee from his chosen and fortified position--a
                        success as yet never achieved by either side in this war, although attempted
                        by Burnside at Fredericksburg and Lee at Gettysburg--Lee could still have
                        retreated up the Potomac, and, if pressed, could have chosen a position at
                        Hancock in the mountains from which double the force of Meade could not
                        dislodge him. With an adequate force on the south side of the Potomac, he
                        might there have suffered capture; but he could scarcely have failed to make
                        good his escape across the river before the Union army could have been thus
                        disposed to cut off his retreat.</p>
                    <p>We doubt not that Meade manoeuvered his army under positive instructions from
                        the Commander-in-Chief not to uncover Washington, or in other words, not to
                        deliver battle with the enemy between him and the National Capitol. The
                        peril of this movement doubtless prevented Meade from throwing his army
                        around from Boonsboro' to Hagerstown to attack Lee from the West on his
                        comparatively unprotected left flank. But such a change in the Union forces
                        could not have been made for an attack in less than twenty-four hours, and
                        Lee would have simply declined battle by crossing the Potomac, as it was
                        passable by the time Meade could have reached a position on his left.</p>
                    <p>It is due to Gen. Meade, who so nobly redeemed Northern soil from rebel
                        invasion by his skill and heroism at Gettysburg, that the almost
                        immeasurable difficulties which confronted him in the pursuit and attempt to
                        engage Lee again, should be known and duly considered. Had he hurled his
                        decimated army upon Lee's fortified lines on Saturday or Sunday and suffered
                        a repulse, Lee would have been re-inforced and renewed his offensive
                        movements upon our soil; and the fruits of the deeply crimsoned victory of
                        Gettysburg would have been lost. Instead of Lee retreating with a shattered,
                        dispirited and hopeless army upon Richmond, Meade would now be retreating
                        with the gallant Army of the Potomac upon the defences of Baltimore and
                        Washington. Disappointed as we must be that Lee has not been destroyed, let
                        us be thankful for the rich fruits of Meade's signal though incomplete
                        triumph, rather than ungenerous in our exactions.</p>
                    <p>We have read much, not only in this, but in other campaigns during this war
                        of the certainty of "bagging" rebel armies; but in field operations such
                        results are simply impossibilities. Burnside was defeated at Fredericksburg
                        with a river in his rear, commanded by rebel batteries yet he withdrew his
                        army safely, losing his dead and wounded. Hooker was defeated at
                        Chancellorsville with a river in his rear swollen to the angriest tide. And
                        Sedgwick was at the same time repulsed with fearful loss on the
                        Fredericksburg heights,--yet both re-crossed their commands in safety in the
                        very face and under the very guns of a rebel commander to whom masterly
                        ability is conceded by friend and foe. Nor did Hooker and Burnside withdraw
                        their commands from before an army worn out by forced marches, and just from
                        fields dripping with the gore of full one-fourth their comrades who entered
                        the battle. Lee's army was comparatively fresh and on its long occupied
                        ground after the battles of Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville, and their
                        loss in neither engagement equaled ours. Yet the Union army retreated in
                        safety, as did Lee from the front of Meade, nor was Lee held as wanting in
                        ability or energy because he did not "bag" Burnside and Hooker. And it is
                        worthy of consideration that the repulses of Burnside and Sedgwick at
                        Fredericksburg, and the disastrous repulse of Lee at Gettysburg, were the
                        results of attacks against skillfully selected and fortified positions just
                        such as Lee held and Meade must have assailed at Williamsport. Let us deal
                        justly if not generously with our heroes, and sustain and strengthen their
                        hearts for future triumphs, rather than cripple them with ill-considered and
                        unmerited criticism. Gen. Meade has done well--who has done better?</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Henry J. Stahle, of the Gettysburg Compiler, was
                        arrested by Gen. Meade as soon as he gained possession of the town, and sent
                        as a prison to Fort McHenry. We cannot form any judgment as to the guilt of
                        Mr. Stahle from the statement and denials on the Gettysburg papers. It is
                        alleged that he gave the reels information where the Union troops and
                        property were concealed, and rendered himself in other respects useful to
                        the enemy.</p>
                    <p>We trust that Mr. Stahle has not been arrested and imprisoned without a
                        purpose. If he has been guilty of the charges preferred against him, he
                        should be promptly tried by a military court, convicted and shot,--if
                        innocent, he should be allowed an early opportunity to establish it and be
                        discharged. It is high time that military arrests should be understood as
                        meaning something beyond imprisonment without notice of charges and release
                        without explanation. Had Daniel Dechert, of Hagerstown, been tried,
                        convicted and inexorably executed, as he richly deserved, when he was
                        detected as a spy within our lines, corresponding with and furnishing maps
                        to bring the enemy to his own home, justice would have been vindicated and a
                        wholesome practical lesson would have been learned by semi-traitors along
                        the entire border. We insist that military arrests shall mean the prompt
                        trial and conviction or acquittal of the accused, and that the penalty of
                        treason, when clearly shown to extend to positive acts of hostility to the
                        Government, shall be death. It is alike just and humane to the loyal people
                        of the North that they shall not be the victims of cowardly spies and
                        traitors at home; and if Mr. Stahle has by his acts brought himself within
                        that class, he should die. But if he is the victim of personal or political
                        prejudice, or of the inflamed public feeling naturally resulting from the
                        shock of battle between the great armies at Gettysburg, he should have early
                        and ample opportunity to vindicate himself, and be discharged to prove his
                        devotion to the Government by an earnest support of the prosecution of the
                        war. In this particular, we must confess, he has room for improvement.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The retreat of Lee with his rebel horde across the Potomac ends all fears of
                        future invasions by the enemy in force; but we shall be constantly liable to
                        rebel cavalry raids unless we take efficient measures to have such a
                        military organization as can defend against such marauding expeditions. It
                        is not probable that the theatre of war will be in close proximity to the
                        Potomac for some time; but being just upon the border, we may be visited at
                        any time by a guerrilla band, such as Mosby's and suffer much thereby.</p>
                    <p>We do not know what disposition will be made of the militia by Gen. Couch,
                        the commander of this Department; but however ample may be his force for
                        ordinary occasions, it is due to ourselves that we have a reserve force that
                        could be called into service in an hour's notice. We entreat our young men
                        of military experience to hasten the organization of an artillery company.
                        None by reliable and punctual men should be taken in it. We are assured that
                        a battery of artillery can be had for such an organization, with ammunition,
                        &amp;c., complete, and with a little care we could soon have a company,
                        which for local defence would be worth thrice its number of improvised
                        militias. We should by all means have a battery here all the time; but we
                        can secure one only by having an effective organization to man it. We trust
                        that this important movement will not be longer delayed.</p>
                    <p>It is equally important that we should have not less than three, and if
                        possible five, cavalry companies organized, equipped and drilled at stated
                        periods. We presume that Gen. Couch would still receive into service in his
                        Department several hundred men, and uniform, arm and equip them, if they
                        would furnish their own horses, for which they would be paid the regular
                        government rates. When relieved from service, these men could keep up their
                        organizations and be ready to answer a call for defence of the border at any
                        moment. Instead of having terror and confusion amongst our people when
                        threatened with a raid, our cavalry could be in the field at once, and scout
                        the lines, ambuscade [sic] the foe, and make marauding a most dangerous
                        business. One thousand men, with some experience and well commanded, would
                        have made Jenkins' first advent into the county quite too uncomfortable for
                        him to remain a whole week stealing at his leisure; and the fact that it has
                        been done once, gives abundant promise that it will be done again unless we
                        prepare to meet it. We earnestly urge upon our citizens, especially the
                        young men who have horses, to take prompt measures to organize cavalry
                        volunteer companies, to be ready to respond to a call at any time for the
                        defence of the board.</p>
                    <p>Important as are Artillery and Cavalry organizations for the purpose of
                        securing us against raids, it is scarcely less important that infantry
                        companies should be organized in every district and drilled as much as
                        possible. Indeed every able-bodied man, or rather every man who is able to
                        walk or pull a trigger, should in some way be prepared to aid in the common
                        defence against rebel plundering expeditions. It must be remembered that the
                        opening of the Mississippi cuts half the entire territory of the South from
                        the so-called Confederacy, and vast supplies were steadily received from
                        south-west of the river. Texas being thus isolated, the present suffering of
                        the rebels must daily increase, and necessity will drive them to plunder
                        every section of country within their reach; and what section is so easily
                        reached and so rich in what they most need, as the Cumberland Valley: We
                        believe that we are now abundantly able to protect ourselves with the aid
                        the government can render us, and let us not be humiliated and robbed again
                        for want of organization and effort on the part of our own people.</p>

                    retreat.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The brief, disastrous career of Gen. Lee on Northern soil was marked by the
                        most reckless inhumanity to his own unfortunate warriors. Even when flushed
                        with the high hope of success, those who died from disease, or skirmishes,
                        were buried, if at all, in rude holes scarcely large enough to hid the
                        bodies, and his sick were left in Chambersburg without medical or other
                        supplies, and that too after he had robbed our Druggists of all medicines,
                        and destroyed our hospital goods. After his repulse at Gettysburg, he
                        commenced his retreat without even trying to bury his dead or minister to
                        his thousands of wounded who could not be removed. To his foe he left the
                        lifeless forms of five thousand of his troops for sepulchre, and full ten
                        thousand of those most seriously wounded were allowed to lie on the gory
                        field to writhe in agonies or die, unless the humanity of strangers, whose
                        homes they sought to desolate should in mercy care for them. The lines of
                        his retreat were strewn with exhausted men,--some dying from wounds, some
                        prostrated by overexertion and disease, and they were left unpitied and
                        unburied. Those who were but slightly wounded at Gettysburg were compelled
                        to march with the wagons in which were placed such as were unable to walk.
                        Not less than from eight to ten thousand were thus straggling in sullen,
                        almost despairing efforts to reach the Potomac. The wagons filled with
                        wounded were driven rapidly to escape capture, and the entire line was
                        hideous with the agonizing shrieks of the sufferers whose shattered limbs
                        were thrown from side to side by the uneven roads. Those who found relief in
                        death were often thrown remorselessly into a field or fence-corner, and left
                        to the humanity of enemies. From Hagerstown to Williamsport the same
                        revolting scenes were witnessed after Lee's final retreat across the

                        was left filled with his wounded, without medical stores or food, and those
                        who still survive, are a charge upon the kindness of the loyal people to
                        whom, according to the Richmond Enquirer, Lee was
                        to minister with "fire and sword."</p>

                    <p>There can no longer be any doubt that Messrs. Dr. James Hamilton, Adam B.

                        James Anderson, James King, Jr., William Mong and J. Porter Brown, citizens
                        of Chambersburg, and in no way connected with the military service, have
                        been taken to Richmond as prisoners by the rebels. They were to Hagerstown
                        without hindrance, when it was occupied by the rebels, and some
                        "constitutional citizen," as Gen. Jenkins would say, doubtless informed on
                        them, and they were arrested in their rooms at the hotel and marched off.
                        Rev. Charles Steck and William Kitzmiller were with them at the time; but
                        Mr. Steck was luckily overlooked, or was believed to be a citizen of
                        Hagerstown, and he was not taken. Mr. Kitzmiller was taken, but ran the
                        gauntlet of a volley of rebel bullets at Failing Waters, and made his
                        escape.</p>
                    <p>We learn from Mr. Kitzmiller, that during the stay of our citizens in
                        Hagerstown--from Tuesday until Friday--but one ration each was issued to
                        them by the rebels; and but for Miss McCameron, Mrs. Daniel Funk, and some
                        other loyal ladies, they would have starved. During the march from
                        Hagerstown until Mr. K. made his escape on the following Tuesday, but one
                        ration was issued to each prison--making but two rations to each man during
                        an entire week. They killed a steer on Sunday, and in that way got some
                        meat, and a friendly woman supplied them with some cakes; but they all
                        suffered much from hunger. All were in good health, notwithstanding the
                        exposure and deprivation of food, when Mr. K left.</p>
