<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Jeff. Davis has issued nearly a score of bombastic proclamations threatening
                        the direst vengeance upon negro troops and their officers in the Union
                        service, although he was always using them in a small way himself, and would
                        have used thousands more but for the fact that they generally landed in our
                        lines as deserters. Now, however, his universal conscription having
                        failed--Vicksburg, Port Hudson, Tullahoma, Gettysburg, Helena and Charleston
                        having made rebel ghosts play fantastic tricks before him, foreign
                        intervention having been indefinitely postponed for want of a respectable
                        belligerent power to recognize--the New York riots and Governor Seymour's
                        "friends" having collapsed into a decent respect for an aroused loyal
                        sentiment and a few thousand bayonets--he plays his last card by calling out
                        500,000 negro troops for the rebel service, and promises them freedom and
                        fifty acres of land. We are glad that Jeff. in the madness of his
                        desperation has planted himself bravely in his "last ditch." If ever there
                        were any doubts about the Emancipation Proclamation, he has brushed them
                        away like so many cobwebs by calling out the slaves as regular troops. Thus
                        does crime ever overleap itself, and however subtle and well devised its
                        schemes, it always leaves open some avenue for retribution.</p>
                    <p>We will now have tested the tendency of the slaves. If they love slavery they
                        will fight for it--if they love freedom they will turn upon the power that
                        calls them to fight for their own enslavement and strike their deadliest
                        blows. In this crowning folly of treason, the last hope of slavery dies out
                        in the Western World.</p>
                    <p>It was Sheridan, we believe, who when he threatened to cut a reckless boy off
                        with a shilling was answered--"very well, father, but where is the shilling
                        to come from?" It is all very well for Jeff. Davis to promise negroes
                        freedom, when they are already free, and fifty acres of land each when
                        neither Jeff. nor his pretended government own so much as a foot of land,
                        save what forgiving humanity may yield for a traitor's grave.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In this week's issue will be found a completed list of the drafted men for
                        this district. Everything passed off pleasantly at the drawing, though there
                        were no very large crowds in attendance until Franklin county was drawn. On
                        Thursday there was a very large attendance; the street in front of the
                        Provost Marshal's office was packed with people, including quite a number of
                        the fair sex. The crowd evinced their good humor by mock congratulations of
                        the elect, and merriment and pleasant badinage seemed to be the order of the
                        day. The draft, like lightning, seemed to strike just where it pleased, and
                        shouts and laughter rose now from one end and in another moment from quite
                        the other end of the assemblage, and the person hit seemed to enjoy it quite
                        as much as his neighbors. Our neighbor of the Spirit, Mr. Hamsher, was one of the lucky drawers of a prize, and
                        the crowd, pleased at having one of the chief and peculiar defenders of the
                        "constitution as it is and the union as it was," enrolled under the "Starry
                        Banner," evinced their pleasure by three hearty cheers. The drawing of the
                        Provost Marshal's name also brought forth cheers. Our reporter was likewise
                        astonished by hearing his name called out, but as he was a nine-months' man,
                        he didn't seem to mind it much. In the Borough luck seemed particularly to
                        run against the Printers, Druggists, Lawyers, and Butchers. There were eight
                        printers, every druggist that was in the first class, seven lawyers, and
                        eight butchers drafted. Through the district the ministers seemed to suffer.
                        In one township in Fulton County, of the eighteen names that were drawn, six
                        were Mellott's. There were twelve colored persons drawn in Chambersburg, and
                        twenty-three in Antrim Township. Though we have often heard objections made
                        to the enlisting of colored men, at the drawing, everybody seemed pleased
                        when they were drawn, and seemed to think their chances so much the better
                        for it. In some districts two, three, and in our borough, four brothers were
                        drawn. Everything passed off agreeably, and we never saw a more jolly crowd
                        assembled together.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The substitute business has called into action every species of fraud and
                        villainy. The draft opened a new and rich field for the Peter Funks and
                        thimble-riggers generally, and they have plied their new trade with immense
                        profit to themselves and corresponding loss to conscripts and the
                        government. Five men were justly shot in the Army of the Potomac on Saturday
                        last for becoming the instruments of substitute-brokers, by whom they were
                        induced to desert and sell themselves several times over as substitutes.</p>
                    <p>It is safe as a rule to refuse to have any dealings with wandering
                        substitute-brokers, or those who advertise from the cities that they are
                        prepared to supply substitutes at marvelously low prices. No man can propose
                        to furnish them at low rates without intending to defraud somebody, and
                        those who have no dealings with them will be sure not to be cheated. Mr.
                        J.A. Thompson, of Pittsburgh, advertises in to-day's paper that he can
                        supply substitutes for less than $50, and invites drafted men to remit him
                        ten cents, for which the profound secret will be made known. Mr. Thompson
                        insists upon advertising in the Repository and paying for it, and we
                        accom[m]odate him as we do patent medicines, circuses, monkey-shows and
                        humbugs generally; but it is due to our readers to say that any man who is
                        silly enough to send him ten cents, must have more dimes than he can use
                        profitably. All who desire to deal honestly with themselves and the
                        government, will furnish their own substitutes or otherwise comply with the
                        law.</p>
