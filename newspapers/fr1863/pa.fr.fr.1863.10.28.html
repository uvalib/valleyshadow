<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Believing that united and systematic effort only could accomplish the work of
                        relieving the suffering in the Army, the "Ladies' Aid" became last April an
                        auxilery [sic] of the "Women's Branch Sanitary Commission," and subsequent
                        visits to the wounded at Gettysburg confirmed the good opinions formed of
                        the Christian and Sanitary Commissions. A lady who spent weeks in the work
                        at Gettysburg remarked to us, that no one could form any conception of the
                        work they accomplished, unless they had witnessed their unwearied labors of
                        love. When the citizens of Gettysburg had been three days in their cellars
                        and without bread for themselves, with 20,000 wounded left there, then these
                        men came as angels of mercy, as almoners of the bounty of American people,
                        and to see them go from one to the other of these suffering heroes, writing
                        their letters, and giving them words of encouragement and trying to fill a
                        mother's and sister's place, and hear them tell with tears in their eyes of
                        the blessedness of the work, would convince the most careless observer that
                        these were the proper channels through which to send gifts.</p>
                    <p>We forwarded in May and June 7 boxes containing the following goods
                        (including a package from the ladies of Fayetteville, consisting of 4
                        shirts, 7 pair of drawers, 1 pair of pillow cases and 2 quilts,) 90 pillow
                        cases, 62 pair drawers, 75 shirts, 14 bed sacks, 76 sheets, 127 towels, 68
                        handkerchiefs, 7 pair of stockings, 6 fans, 20 comforts, 15 quilts, 4
                        blankets, 22 wrappers, 4 pair of slippers and 14 pillows; also from friends
                        in town and country a large quantity of canned and preserved fruit, bologna
                        sausage, 14 doz. eggs, corn starch, farina, jellies, butter, &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Grier, of Philadelphia, acknowledges our boxes in the following terms:
                        "We received your well filled boxes and thank your society on behalf of
                        those brave men, upon whom the Commission will have the pleasure of
                        bestowing their contents. truly this is a noble work, and I doubt if the
                        history of the world will produce another instance of the organization of so
                        vast a scheme of benevolence. The donors are counted by millions and the
                        army who receives it is 700,000 strong. It is a great work, but it can be
                        performed while the people--especially the women of the country--are true to
                        their mission. God grant that so it may be, and that there be no abatement
                        of patriotic fervor or humane influence while there remains heroes among us,
                        to be cared for living, or watched and tended in dying."</p>
                    <p>We also received and forwarded three large and
                        valuable boxes from the ladies of St. Thomas Township, containing butter,
                        fruit, jellies, tea, corn starch, tomatoes, &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>After the battle of Gettysburg we received and forwarded from friends in
                        Greenvillage, 32 loaves of bread, 23 dozen of rusk, butter, apple butter,
                        dried fruit, &amp;c. And from our own society, shirts, sheets, towels,
                        drawers, 8 pillows, 18 handkerchiefs, bologna sausage, tongue, chip beef,
                        corn starch, 4 bottles of wine, raspberry vinegar, &amp;c. Other
                        articles received at that time were used in Hospitals at home. To these
                        latter we desire to call the attention of our friends. Such articles as
                        apple butter, peach butter, pickles, &amp;c., are needed and will be
                        thankfully received.</p>
                    <p>Persons having old cotton or linen are requested to leave it at Nixon's Drug
                        Store, for the use of 500 wounded still at Gettysburg.</p>

                    The editors claim that the southern counties labored under heavy difficulties.
                    The rebel invasion brought increased influence to Copperheads who encouraged
                    citizens to vote against Curtin because the state government was slow in its
                    compensation to the invaded areas. They also criticize the Provost Marshal

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In another column of to-day's paper we give the official vote for Governor.
                        The poll is unprecedented--being larger than that of 1860, notwithstanding
                        the fact that full twenty thousand brave Pennsylvania voters now fill
                        untimely graves, heroic martyrs to the preservation of our sacred
                        Nationality, and not less than fifty thousand more were denied the right of
                        suffrage solely because they confront the foes of the Republic in the field.
                        Gov. Curtin's majority seems small with so large a vote cast; but it must be
                        borne in mind that of those who were refused the privilege of voting
                        certainly nineteen-twentieths of them would have cast their votes for him.
                        Had the popular expression of the State not been restrained by Judge
                        Woodward's decision disfranchising the soldiers, Gov. Curtin would now be
                        the Governor elect by not less than 50,000, instead of the meagre 15,000 by
                        which the State has been barely saved from fatal hostility to the
                        government. Grateful as loyal men everywhere must be fore the declared
                        majority on the right side, it is due to the great issue that the moral
                        weight of the disfranchised voters of the State be considered in estimating
                        the fidelity of our great Commonwealth to our Free Institutions.</p>
                    <p>The Union men of Pennsylvania were beset with embarrassments in the late
                        contest, such as would have been fatal in any ordinary political struggle.
                        Especially in the Southern counties did the loyal men labor under almost
                        crushing disadvantages--some of them unavoidable, but others were wantonly
                        or stupidly imposed upon us. The invaded counties were beset by malignant
                        Copperheads with untiring energy, and a thousand petty streams of poison
                        flowed out upon the people from the fountain heads of sneaking traitors.
                        Every man who had been plundered by the rebels, or who had suffered from the
                        necessary occupation of our territory by the Union troops, was counseled by
                        every species of falsehood to array himself against the government because
                        the government did not promptly remunerate him; and hundreds of votes were
                        lost to the Union cause in this section, because of these persistent appeals
                        to narrow selfishness, when a great Nation was struggling for the liberty
                        that overshadows and protects every home, every civil and religious right,
                        and insures safety to the person and property of every American citizen. The
                        failure to compensate our people was charged to the wanton perverseness of
                        the State and National Administrations; and peace and prompt payment were
                        promised lavishly if Woodward should be chosen Governor. A few were thus
                        deceived and made to turn against themselves, for falsehood ever outstrips
                        the truth in an even race; but the great mass of our sufferers stood
                        manfully in support of the right.</p>
                    <p>The draft was a staggering load. It was no fault of the administration that
                        it proved a ridiculous failure to the government and a costly farce to the
                        people; nor did the authorities do anything more nor less than their duty in
                        prosecuting it. Men were imperatively demanded for our weakened armies, and
                        so emboldened has the foes of the government become that volunteering was
                        wholly stopped. The administration had but one way to clear its skirts and
                        that was to exhaust the authority it possessed to procure men. That the law
                        providing for a draft was shamefully defective, was the fault of Congress,
                        not of the administration; and they had to wade through Congressional
                        blunders and harass, bleed and alienate twenty citizens for every man added
                        to the army. Had the $300 exemption clause been omitted, and each
                        able-bodied man drafted been required to serve in person or by substitute,
                        men would have responded with comparative cheerfulness, and the draft would
                        have been sustained by the people because of the palpable good attained by
                        it; but when its failure was evident to all, it took into the army only now
                        and then some penniless and friendless citizen, whose lot was deemed a cruel
                        one, not so much because he had to go, as because his neig[h]bors were
                        enabled not to go. Many, of course, did not stop to inquire whose fault it
                        was that they were harassed by a draft that was fruitless of good, and men
                        were not wanting to seize the favorable opportunity to impress them with the
                        conviction that the government was despotic and faithless to the people.</p>
                    <p>But bad as the draft was when conducted skil[l]fully and divested of all
                        wanton impression, it was made worse by the stupidity and reckless disregard
                        of the rights of the people by the Provost Marshal General. Just on the eve
                        of an election, the people of Somerset, Bedford and Fulton were summoned to
                        report at Chambersburg to claim exemption, pay commutation money or furnish
                        substitutes. Many of them had to cross the Alleghenies and travel nearly
                        three hundred miles--costing them largely in time and money, when the Board
                        of Exemption could have gone from county to county with little of no
                        inconvenience. Repeated applications were made to the Provost Marshal
                        General, and the members of the Board joined in the request, that the people
                        should not be needlessly dragged over the mountains hundreds of miles; but
                        no regard whatever was paid to the application, although in several other
                        districts of the State the authority for the Board to go tot he various
                        county towns was granted. It would have been a small matter for three
                        officers and a few clerks to go to Somerset or Bedford for a week; but it
                        was not a small matter for one thousand men to cross the Alleghenies and
                        come one hundred and fifty miles to transact an hour's business. That the
                        people appreciated it as an insolent disregard of their convenience was not
                        surprising; and instead of losing Fulton by 260, and Bedford by 280, and
                        gaining Somerset by over 1,300, the only wonder is that we did not lose
                        1,000 more. We beg Col. Fry to bear in mind that the success of this war and
                        the safety of the government are with the People, and needless oppression in
                        the execution of laws cannot be justified by the presumed sanctity of
                        military regulations.</p>
                    <p>Altogether the Southern counties did well. The Union men struggled
                        heroically, and improved materially on the vote of last year in every county
                        South of the Susquehanna, and can justly claim their full part in the great
                        revolution that has declared in behalf of the preservation of our imperiled
                        Nationality.</p>
