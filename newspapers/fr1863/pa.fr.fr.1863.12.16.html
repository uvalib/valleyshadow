</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Since President Lincoln's late Proclamation has been spread before an
                        intelligent and loyal people, every one who has sustained him in his efforts
                        to crush this rebellion and vindicate the integrity of the Government, must
                        breathe freer when after two years of war a Proclamation of Amnesty is
                        extended to the rebels. This Proclamation of Amnesty is extended to the
                        rebels. This Proclamation settles very easily and practically the difficult
                        questions which even great men were stumbling at, and which often looked as
                        troublesome as the vindication of the Government and the restoration of the
                        Union. This proclamation meets the cordial approbation of every loyal man in
                        the country, and will be zealously supported as the basis of re-organization
                        in the South. The institution of Slavery is emphatically dead, and cannot in
                        the future, even by party triumph, be galvanized into a show of vitality.
                        The President's proposition then is the simplest and easiest plan of
                        restoration to the blessings and benefits of a beneficent government.</p>
                    <p>It is also satisfactory to the loyal people because it fixes the status of
                        those high in power in the so-called Confederate Government, upon whose
                        shoulders rest the responsibility of this war. It has been repeatedly said
                        that human slavery was at the bottom of this unhallowed rebellion. This we
                        believe, for an institution so barbarous can only be vindicated by its
                        advocates allying themselves to the atrocities of the savage, from which the
                        common instincts of an enlightened people rebel. Liberty needs not the dirt
                        of the assassin to support it. It asks an unlimbered press and the
                        privileges of free speech, and when these are checked in this enlightened
                        age, a revolution in sentiment will necessarily overturn the obstacles in
                        the way, and give free course to the mighty channels which give power to the
                        thoughts and notions of representative men.</p>
                    <p>Two years ago the South had the advantage in political leaders by common
                        consent. Now they are singled out as only fit for the traitor's doom. To day
                        the President offers terms to the unfortunate and the innocent, leaving the
                        alternative to the guilty. The majesty of the Government must be respected
                        and its power acknowledged, or those who raise the arm of rebellion must
                        themselves be the victims of their own atrocity. In this day, when
                        enlightened opinions are gaining ground, and when governments freely
                        scrutinize each other, and by the free press of at least two powerful
                        nations, England and America, neither the institution of slavery, nor those
                        who by rebellion attempt to sustain it, can exist. Total destruction is
                        their fate. If the people of England more than two centuries ago taught
                        kings a wholesome lesson by impeaching, dethroning, trying and condemning
                        one by the very laws he had violated, so may the people of the United States
                        demand the death of the authors of fraternal war, because of their bold and
                        bloody effort at usurpation and rebellion. The Queen of England is as much
                        bound by her oath as any private citizen. She is the servant of the people;
                        the people are her peers; not the crowned heads of other nations. If she
                        commit offences against the people and the Constitution, accepted and
                        honored by the people, she may be tried like a private individual for her
                        offence, and if proved guilty be punished therefor. Such men the noble
                        arguments brought to bear upon the case of Charles I by the great Milton,
                        and in a blundering, blood-thirsty way, such were the pretexts made use of
                        by the French Jacobins upon the trial of Louis XVI.</p>
                    <p>The English people did execute the beautiful but misguided Mary Stuart, and
                        it must be remembered that this took place at a period of earnest religious
                        reform and excitement, when the conflict was for freedom of
                        thought--Protestantism as opposed to Romanism, and for offences and deep
                        laid conspiracies against a Queen. For this she was condemned and suffered a
                        felon's doom. The world's history is full of examples of men high in power,
                        as well as private citizens, who for schemes and devices against recognized
                        authority, have paid the penalty of their folly by the forfeiture of their
                        lives.</p>
                    <p>Many of the South are sincerely loyal and long for the blessings they once
                        enjoyed under the United States Government, but there are also many that
                        need the strong arm of power just as they love the pomp and show of
                        arbitrary Empire. To take away from such the strong arm of power, would not
                        be to restore them to liberty with its natural attendants law and order, but
                        to absolute anarchy and license, and bring back the summary executions upon
                        the nearest tree, the hunting down by blood hounds, and the savageness of
                        men who are little better than a race of ferocious tigers when given over to
                        their unrestrained instincts. Abolish the institution of Slavery, and
                        restore the Union of States on the President's proposition, and those who
                        have originated and carried on this unholy rebellion must necessarily seek
                        refuge and find homes in foreign lands. Free soil, Free Institutions and
                        Free Government are not suited to their depraved notions of social and
                        political economy. The Country will be better rid of them. The great idea of
                        Human Freedom, that is destined to carry everything before it, as the
                        crowning glory of the nineteenth century, needs not their services, nor can
                        it be long impeded by their opposition.</p>
                    <p>In no other country in the world, nor under the operations of any other
                        government could so gigantic a rebellion have been met and crushed in so
                        short a time, and with such paramount blessings to the world resulting from
                        it, as the one now rapidly closing in America. Let us hope in the future,
                        for it is full of promise, and while we contemplate its glories and
                        blessings let us not forget the stern reality of the present.</p>
