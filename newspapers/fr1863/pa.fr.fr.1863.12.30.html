<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Richmond Enquirer of the 17th inst. solves the
                        problem of negro prisoners by frankly admitting that they have been
                        murdered. Speaking of the government sending negro troops to the field it
                        says: "Should they be sent to the field, and be put in battle, none will be taken prisoners--our troops understand what
                            to do in such cases. If any negroes have been captured during the
                        war we have not heard of them." Thus is answered the repeated inquiries of
                        the North as to the fate of our negro soldiers who fell into rebel hands at
                        Milliken's Bend; at Port Hudson; at Morris Island, and other places. They have all been brutally murdered. None have
                        been captured--"none will be taken prisoners," says the Enquirer, and it boasts that rebel troops have been thoroughly
                        indoctrinated with the fie[n]dish ferocity of the rebel leaders, for the
                        same paper adds--"our troops understand what to do in such cases."</p>
                    <p>Hitherto the government has been unable to get any official information from
                        the rebels as to the fate of our negro prisoners; but the truth cannot now
                        be long suppressed even in official circles. What course the authorities
                        will take we can't pretend to indicate; but they will doubtless vindicate
                        the rights and avenge the wrongs of our negro troops tot he uttermost. To
                        this the government stands pledged not only by its acceptance of such
                        troops, but by its formally plighted faith; and it would not recede from it
                        if it could; it certainly could not if it would. Every negro soldier,
                        regularly mustered into the service of the United States, who has been
                        captured under the National Flag, must be accounted for by the rebel
                        authorities, and wherein the common dictates of humanity have failed to
                        insure justice to prisoners the terrible lex
                        talionis must do its work.</p>
                    <p>The suicidal madness of the rebel leaders seems to be without measure. We now
                        hold more than one-half their originally claimed territory, with its
                        property and population. Fully 50,000 negro troops are now regularly in
                        service, most of them holding military possession of the lands whereon they
                        once were slaves; and should success crown the efforts of Gens. Grant and
                        Banks, not less than 100,000 more negro soldiers will be added to the army
                        during the next four or six months. These troops will be the military power
                        of the government in the Southern States, where they are acclimated, and
                        will they be strangers to the dictates of vengeance when they find that they
                        are to be murdered remorselessly, if captured, as their comrades have been?
                        This question is one for the relentless friends of treason to answer. The
                        negro will make all things even in time; and if he must teach humanity to
                        his arrogant foe by fearful vengeance, the crimsoned chapter will be the
                        work of the once master--not of the once slave.</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports the efforts by Congressman Harding to exclude black soldiers from

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Congress was brought to an unexpected test on the employment of negro troops
                        last week, by Mr. Harding, Border State Copperhead. When the bill providing
                        for bounties to volunteers was under consideration, the "friends" of Jeff
                        Davis were quibbling and dodging about as usual, when Mr. Harding, who don't
                        disguise his rebel proclivities, moved to amend by providing that no part of
                        the fund should be used to recruit negro troops. It threw the rebel
                        stool-pigeons into a fearful flutter when the yeas and nays were called; but
                        the call was insisted upon and they had to face the music. Fernando Wood,
                        the leader of the Peace men, bolted square and voted to pay bounty to negro
                        troops and with him went half a dozen others from New York, Connecticut, New
                        Jersey, including Bailey of this State; but Coffroth and all the
                        Pennsylvania Copperheads voted with Harding against offering any
                        encouragement for the enlistment of negroes. The amendment was, however,
                        defeated by the decisive vote of 105 to 41. Will somebody remind Gen.
                        Coffroth that he is a member of the Congress of the United States, and not of the rebel Congress?</p>
