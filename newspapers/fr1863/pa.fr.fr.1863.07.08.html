<b>Invasion Of Pennsylvania!</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository provides a detailed account of the Rebel General Jenkins's
                    first invasion and occupation of Chambersburg, which began on June 17. It
                    reports that Jenkins prevented much damage, but "robbed" stores (paying with
                    "bogus money"--Confederate scrip) of most goods. His men took arms and horses as
                    contraband of war. Many horses and most of the black population escaped to the
                    mountains. The Repository calculated $300,000 in property damage.<br>

                    <p>Franklin County has had a full week of rebel guerilla rule, and is now, in
                        the Southern portion, plundered of all horses and cattle, excepting the few
                        successfully secreted in the mountains.</p>
                    <p>The Alarm</p>
                    <p>On Sunday evening, the 16th inst., the dark clouds of contrabands commenced
                        rushing upon us, bringing the tidings that Gen. Milroy's forces at
                        Martinsburg had been attacked and scattered, and that the rebels under Gen.
                        Rhodes were advancing upon Pennsylvania. With due allowance for the
                        excessive alarm of the slaves, it was manifest that the rebels were about to
                        clear out the Shenandoah Valley, and, that once done, the Cumberland, with
                        all its teeming wealth, would be at rebel mercy. On Sunday night our people
                        were much excited, and the question of protection became one of paramount
                        interest. To inquiries the authorities at Washington answered that the
                        aspect of the war just at present rendered it unwise to divide or weaken the
                        army of the Potomac, and that Pennsylvania must furnish her own men for her
                        defence [sic]. A call from the President was issued to that effect, which is
                        noticed elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>The Skedaddle.</p>
                    <p>On Monday morning the flood of rumors from the Potomac fully confirmed the
                        advance of the rebels, and the citizens of Chambersburg and vicinity,
                        feeling unable to resist the rebel columns, commenced to make prompt
                        preparation for the movement of stealable property. Nearly every horse,
                        good, bad and indifferent, was started for the mountains as early on Monday
                        as possible, and the Negroes darkened the different roads Northward for
                        hours, loaded with house hold effects, sable babies, &amp;c and horses
                        and wagons and cattle crowded every avenue to places of safety. About
                        [illegible] o'clock in the morning, the advance [illegible] Milroy's
                        retreating wagon-train dashed in town, attended by a few cavalry, and a
                        [illegible] affrighted wagon-masters, all of whom declared that the rebels
                        were in hot pursuit that a large portion of the train was captured, and that
                        the enemy was about to enter Chambersburg. This startling information,
                        coming from men in uniform, who had fought valiantly until the enemy had got
                        nearly within sight of them, naturally gave fresh impetus to the citizens,
                        and the skedaddle commenced in magnificent earnestness and exquisite
                        confusion. Men, women and children who seemed to think the [illegible] so
                        many cannibals rushed out the turnpike, and generally kept on the leading
                        thoroughfares as if they were determined to be captured, if the rebels were
                        anywhere within range and wanted them. We watched the motley cavalcade rush
                        along for a few hours, when it seems to have occurred to some one to inquire
                        whether the rebels were not some distance in the rear; and a few moments of
                        reflection and dispassionate inquiry satisfied the people that the enemy
                        could not be upon us for several hours at least. The railroad men were
                        prompt and systematic in their efforts to prepare for another fire, and by
                        noon all the portable property of the company was safely under control to be
                        hauled and moved at pleasure. The more thoughtful portion of our people who
                        felt it a duty to keep out of rebel hands, remained until the cutting of
                        telegraph communication south, and the reports of reliable scouts rendered
                        it advisable to give way to the guerilla army of plunderers.</p>
                    <p>The Rebels Advance on Greencastle.</p>
                    <p>[Note: The edge of this page is missing.]</p>
                    <p>Greencastle, being but five miles north of Maryland line, and in the direct
                        route of rebels, was naturally enough in the high-state of excitement on
                        Sunday night and Monday morning. Exaggerated rumors had of course flooded
                        them, and every half-hour a stampede was made before the imagined rebel
                        columns. Hon. John Rows at last determined to reconnoiter and he mounted a
                        [illegible] and started out toward Hagerstown. A little distance beyond, he
                        was captured by a squad of rebels, and held until Gen. Jenkins came up.
                        Jenkins asked Rows his [illegible] and was answered correctly. He
                        subsequently asked Mr.___________, who was with [illegible], what Rows's
                        name was, and upon being told that the name had been given to [illegible]
                        correctly, he insisted that the Major [illegible] been an officer in the
                        United States [illegible] Mr.____assured Jenkins that the [illegible] had
                        never been in the service, and he [illegible] satisfied. (Jenkins had
                        evidently [illegible] Major Howe with his son, the [illegible] Leutenant
                        [sic] Colonel Rows of the 126th.) [illegible] then asked Mr._______whom he
                        had [illegible] for at the last Presidential election. [illegible] answered
                        that he had voted for Lincoln. D[illegible] Jenkins gave the following
                        chaste [illegible] reply --"Get off that horse, you [illegible]
                        Abolitionist." The horse was surrendered, and the same question was
                        pro-[illegible] to Major Rows, who answered that he had [illegible] for
                        Douglas, and had scratched every Breckinridge man off his ticket. [Note:
                        Folds down the middle of this column makes much of the text illegible.]
                        Jenkins answered--"You can ride your horse as long as [illegible] like --I
                        voted for Douglas myself." [illegible] He then demanded to know what forces
                        were in Greencastle and what fortifications. [illegible] Roy told him that
                        the town was defenceless, but Jenkins seemed to be cautious [illegible]
                        might be caught in a trap. He advanced cautiously, reconnoitered all
                        suspicious buildings and finally being fully satisfied [illegible] there was
                        not a gun in position and not a [illegible] under arms, he resolved upon
                        capturing [illegible] town by a brilliant charge of cavalry. [illegible]
                        accordingly divided his forces into two [illegible] charged upon the vacated
                        streets, and reached the centre [sic] of the town without [illegible] man.
                        This brilliant achievement [illegible] soon after entering Pennsylvania
                        seemed to encourage the gallant guerilla chief [illegible] more daring
                        deeds, and he immediately [illegible] to empty stables and capture every
                        article within his reach that seemed [illegible] fancy of his men. He
                        announced [illegible] for ears polite that he had come [illegible] burn and
                        destroy, and that he would be at Greencastle. Maj. Rowe informed [illegible]
                        that he could burn Greencastle, but that would end his depredations and his
                        [illegible] at about that point. Jenkins [illegible] as he blustered, and
                        Jenkins didn't [illegible] destroy. He probably forgot to apply the torch.
                        Generous teaching of memor[illegible].</p>
                    <p>Jenkins [illegible] Upon Chambersburg</p>
                    <p>The rebels [illegible] evidently under the impression that [illegible] would
                        be thrown in their way at an [illegible] they pushed forward for
                        Chambersburg. About 11 o'clock on Monday [illegible] they arrived at the
                        Southern end of the [illegible] the same intensely strategic movement
                        exhibited at Greencastle were displayed [illegible] Several were thrown
                        forward [illegible] to reconnoitre, [sic] and a few of our brave [illegible]
                        captured them and took their horses. [illegible] taste of war whetted the
                        appetite of Jenkins and he resolved to capture the town [illegible]
                        brilliant dash, without so much as a demand for surrender. He divided his
                        forced into [illegible] columns--about two hundred in [illegible] as a
                        forlorn hope, to whom was assigned the desperate task of charging upon empty
                        and undefended streets, store-[illegible] beds &amp;c. of the ancient
                        village of Chambersburg. Every precaution, that [illegible] could invent was
                        taken to prevent [illegible]. Men were detailed to ride along the
                        [illegible] before the charge [illegible] to plant artillery [illegible] the
                        redoubtable Jenkins had not so much as a swivel in his army. The women and
                        children having been sufficiently frightened by the threatened booming of
                        artillery, and all things being in [illegible], the forlorn hope advanced,
                        and the most desperate charge ever known in the history of war--in
                        Chambersburg at last--was made. Down the street came the iron clatter of
                        hoofs like the tempest with a thousand thunderbolts; but the great plan had
                        failed [illegible] one particular, and the column recoiled before it reached
                        the Diamond. A mortar [illegible] on the street, in front to Mr. White's
                        [illegible] building, had not been observed in the reconnoitering of the
                        town, nor had willing Copperheads advised him of it. His force [illegible]
                        hurled against it; down went some men [illegible] bang went a gun. To strike
                        a mortar-bed [illegible] have a gun fired at the same time, was more than
                        the strategy of Jenkins had bargained for; and the charge was broken and
                        fell back. A few moments of fearful suspense, and the mortar-bed was
                        carefully reconnoitered, [illegible] the musket report was found to be an
                        accidental discharge of a gun in the hands of one of his own men who had
                        fallen. With boldness and dash worthy of Jenkins, it was resolved to renew
                        the attack without even the formality of a council of war. Again [illegible]
                        steeds of war thundered down the street and, there being nothing in the way,
                        over [illegible] all opposition, and the borough of Chambersburg was under
                        the rule of Jenkins. Having won it by the most determined and brilliant
                        prowess, Jenkins resolved that he would be magnanimous, and would allow
                        nothing to be taken from our people--excepting such article as he and his
                        men wanted.</p>
                    <p>Jenkins Encamps With the Editor</p>
                    <p>Jenkins had doubtless [illegible] the papers in his day, and knew that there
                        were green fields in the "Green Spot" and what is rather remarkable, at
                        night he could start for a forty acre clover patch belonging to the Editor
                        of the Repository without so much as stopping to ask where the gate might be
                        found. Not even a [illegible] called to find it; but the march was continued
                        until the gate was reached, when the order "file right" was given, and
                        Jenkins was in clover. Happy fellow thus to find [illegible] and extensive
                        clover as if by [illegible]. By way of giving the devil his due, it
                        [illegible] be said that, although there were over sixty acres of wheat, and
                        eighty acres of [illegible] and oats in the same field, he protected
                        [illegible] most carefully and picketed his horses so [illegible] it could
                        not be injured. And equal care [illegible] taken of all other property about
                        the [illegible], excepting half-a-dozen of our fattest [illegible] sheep
                        which were necessary, it seems, to furnish chops, &amp;c. for his men.
                        [illegible] fences were wantonly destroyed, poultry [illegible] was not
                        disturbed, nor did he compliment our blooded cattle so much as to test the
                        quality of their steak and roasts. Some of his men cast a wistful eye upon
                        the gleaming trout in the spring; but they were protected by voluntary
                        order, and save a few quarts of delicious strawberries gathered with every
                        care, after first asking permission, nothing in the garden, or about the
                        grounds was taken. Having had a taste of rebel love for horses last October,
                        when Gen. Stuart's officers first stole our horses, and then supped and
                        smoked socially with us, we had started to the mountains slightly in advance
                        of Jenkins' occupation of the town, and, being unable to find them, we are
                        happy to say that Gen. Jenkins didn't steal our new assortment.</p>
                    <p>Jenkins and Staff Are Sociable.</p>
                    <p>However earnest an enemy Jenkins may be, he don't seem to keep spite, but is
                        capable of being very jolly and sociable when he is treated hospitably. For
                        prudential reasons, the Editor was not at home to do the honors at his own
                        table; but Jenkins was not particular, nor was his appetite impaired
                        thereby. He called upon the ladies of the house, shared their hospitality,
                        behaved in all respects like a gentleman, and expressed very earnest regrets
                        that he had not been able to make the personal acquaintance of the Editor
                        [illegible] beg to say that we reciprocate the wish of the General and shall
                        be glad to make his acquaintance personally --"when this cruel war is over."
                        Col. French and Surgeon Bee spent much of their time with Mrs. McClure, and
                        the former showed his appreciation of her hospitality by taking her revolver
                        from her when he left. An order having been made for the citizens to
                        surrender all the guns and pistols they had, Col. French took the pistol of
                        his hostess. How many rifles he didn't get that were in her keeping, we
                        "da'na choose to tell."</p>
                    <p>Jenkins Buys Out the Town</p>
                    <p>Horses seemed to be considered contraband of war and were taken without the
                        pretence [sic] of compensation; but other articles were deemed legitimate
                        subject of commerce even between enemies, and they were generally paid for
                        after a fashion. True, the system of Jenkins would be considered a little
                        informal in business circles; but it's his way, and our people agreed to it
                        perhaps to some extent because of the novelty, but mainly because of the
                        necessity of the thing. But Jenkins was liberal--eminently liberal. He
                        didn't stoop to haggle about a few odd pennies in making a bargain. For
                        instance, he took the drugs of Messrs. Miller, Spangler, Nixon and Heyser,
                        and told them to make out a bill, or if they could not do that, to guess at
                        the amount, and the bills were paid. Doubtless our merchants and druggists
                        would have preferred "green-backs" to confederate scrip that is never
                        payable, and is worth just its weight in old paper; but Jenkins hadn't
                        "green-backs" and he had confederate scrip, and such as he had he gave unto
                        them. Thus he dealt largely in our place. To avoid the jealousies growing
                        out of rivalry in business, he patronised [sic] all the merchants, and
                        bought pretty much everything he could conveniently use and carry. Some
                        people, with the antiquated ideas of business, might call it stealing to
                        take goods and pay for them in bogus money; but Jenkins calls it business,
                        and for the time being what Jenkins called business, was business. In this
                        way he robbed all the stores; drug stores, &amp;c., more or less, and
                        supplied himself with many articles of great value to him.</p>
                    <p>Jenkins Regulates the City Fathers.</p>
                    <p>Jenkins, like most doctors, don't seem to have relished his own
                        prescriptions. Several horses had been captured by some of our boys, and
                        notice was given by the general commanding that they must be surrendered or
                        the town would be destroyed. The city fathers, commonly known as the town
                        council, were appealed to in order to avert the impending fate threatened
                        us. One of the horses, we believe, and some of the equipments were found and
                        returned, but there was still a balance in favor of Jenkins. We do not know
                        who audited the account, but it was finally adjusted by the council
                        appropriating the sum of $900 to pay the claim. Doubtless Jenkins hoped for
                        $900 dollars in "greenbacks," but he had flooded the town with confederate
                        scrip, pronouncing it better than United States currency, and the council
                        evidently believed him, and desiring to be accommodating with a conqueror,
                        decided to favor him by the payment of his [illegible] confederate scrip. It
                        was so done, and Jenkins got just $900 worth of nothing for his trouble. He
                        took it, however, without a murmur, and doubtless considered it a clever
                        joke.</p>
                    <p>Jenkins Calls for Arms.</p>
                    <p>Sore was the disappointment of Jenkins at the general exodus of horses from
                        this place. It limited his booty immensely. Fully five hundred had been
                        taken from Chambersburg and vicinity to the mountains, and Jenkins plunder
                        was thus made just so much less. But he determined to make up for it by
                        stealing all the arms in the town. He therefore issued an order requiring
                        the citizens to bring him all the arms they had, public or private, within
                        two hours; and search, and terrible vengeance were threatened in case of
                        disobedience. Many of our citizens complied with the order, and a committee
                        of our people was appointed to take a list of the persons presenting arms.
                        Of course very many did not comply, but enough did so to avoid a general
                        search and probable sacking of the town. The arms were assorted--the
                        indifferent destroyed, and the good taken along.</p>
                    <p>Jenkins Takes a Fright.</p>
                    <p>On Tuesday a few of Milroy's cavalry, [illegible] Martinsburg, were seen by
                        the redoubtable Jenkins hovering in his front. Although thirteen in number,
                        and without the appetite for a battle with his two thousand men, he took on
                        a fright of huge proportions and prepared to sell his command [illegible]
                        early as possible. Like a prudent general, however, he provided fully for
                        his retreat. [illegible] shrill blast of the bugle brought his men
                        [illegible] arms with the utmost possible alacrity; [illegible] were called
                        in to swell the ranks [illegible] horses and baggage, consisting principally
                        of stolen goods, were sent to the rear, [illegible] of the town; the surgeon
                        took forcible possession of all our building, houses, barns sheds,
                        &amp;c., to be used as hospitals, and officially requested that their
                        wounded should be humanely treated in case of their sudden retreat without
                        being able to take them along. The hero of two brilliant cavalry charges
                        upon undefended towns, was agitated beyond endurance at the prospect of a
                        battle; [illegible line] than the State Capital, over fifty miles distant,
                        and there the same scene [illegible] being presented. Jenkins in
                        Chambersburg and the militia at Harrisburg, [illegible] momentarily
                        expecting to be cut to pieces by the other. But these armies, alike
                        [illegible] in their heroism, were spared the dead [illegible] of arms,
                        inasmuch as even the most [illegible] ordnance is not deemed fatal at
                        [illegible] fitfy [sic] miles. Both armies, as the [illegible] reports go,
                        "having accomplished [illegible] purpose, retired in good order."</p>
                    <p>[illegible] Houses Plundered.</p>
                    <p>As a [illegible] believe that private houses were not [illegible] by Jenkins'
                        forces; but there were some exceptions. The residences of Messrs.
                        [illegible] and Gipe, near Chambersburg, [illegible] entered (the families
                        being absent) [illegible] plundered of clothing, kettles, and other
                        [illegible]. Bureaus and cupboards were all emptied of their contents, and
                        such articles as they wanted were taken. We have not [illegible] of any
                        instances of the kind in town.</p>
                    <p>Rebels Snub the Copperheads.</p>
                    <p>A very [illegible] of our citizens exhibited the craven [illegible] the
                        genuine Copperhead; but Jenkins and his men, in no instance, treated them
                        with [illegible] courtesy. That they made use of some such creatures to
                        obtain information can [illegible] be doubted; but they spurned all attempts
                        [illegible] claim their respect because of professed [illegible] with their
                        cause. To one who [illegible] to make fair weather with Jenkins [illegible]
                        professions of sympathy with the [illegible], he answered--"Well, if you
                        believe we are right, take your gun and join our ranks!" It is needless to
                        say that the cowardly [illegible] did not obey. To another he said--
                        "[illegible] we had such men as you in the South, we would hang them!" They
                        say, on all occasions, that there are but two modes of peace--disunion or
                        subjugation--and they stoutly deny that the latter is possible. Lieut.
                        Reilly had [illegible] returned from West Point the day the rebels reached
                        here, and of his presence and [illegible] they were minutely advised, for
                        [illegible] called at the house and compelled his sister to go with them
                        into every room to search for him. Gen. Jenkins also had the fullest
                        information of the movements of the Editor of this paper. He told at our own
                        house, [illegible] had left, the direction we had gone, [illegible]
                        described the horse we rode, and added that there were people in
                        Chambersburg sufficiently cowardly and treacherous to give such information
                        of their neighbors. When it was suggested that such people should be sent
                        within the rebel lines, he insisted that the South should not be made a
                        Botany Bay for Northern scoundrels.</p>
                    <p>Negroes Taken South.</p>
                    <p>Quite a number of Negroes, free and slave--men, women and children--were
                        captured by Jenkins and started South to be sold into bondage. Many escaped
                        in various ways, and the people of Greencastle captured the guard of one
                        negro [illegible] in and discharged the negroes; but, perhaps a full fifty
                        were got off to slavery. One negro effected his escape by shooting and
                        seriously wounding his rebel guard. He forced the gun from the rebel and
                        fired, wounding [illegible] in the head, and then skedaddled. Some of the
                        men were bound with ropes, and the children were mounted in front or behind
                        the rebels on their horses. By great exertions of several citizens some of
                        the negroes were discharged.</p>
                    <p>The Southern Border Plundered.</p>
                    <p>The southern border of this county has been literally plundered of everything
                        in the stock line, excepting such as could be secreted. But it was difficult
                        to secrete stock, as the rebels spent a full week in the county, and
                        leisurely hunted out horses and cattle without molestation. The citizens
                        were unable to protect themselves, and owing to the [illegible] of
                        promptness of [illegible] citizens elsewhere [illegible] respond to the call
                        for troops, aid could [illegible] be had. We have [illegible] sufficient
                        data to estimate the loss sustained by the county; but it cannot fall short
                        of a quarter of a million of dollars. It is a fearful blow to our people,
                        coming as it does in the throngest [sic] season of the year, and many
                        croppers, who had little else than their stock, have been rendered almost if
                        not entirely bankrupt by the raid. If the people of Pennsylvania will not
                        fight to protect the State from invasion, the sufferers have a right to
                        claim compensation from the common treasury of the State. The State
                        professes to protect its citizens in the enjoyment of all their rights, and
                        there is no justice in withholding the common tribute from individual
                        sufferers. Among the many unfortunate, perhaps the greatest sufferer, is
                        ex-Sheriff Taylor, from whom the rebels captured a drove of fat cattle in
                        Fulton county. His loss is some $7,000.</p>
                    <p>Jenkins' Route.</p>
                    <p>The route of Jenkins was through the most densely populated and wealthiest
                        portion of the county. From this point he fell back to Greencastle and south
                        of it, thence he proceeded to Mercersburg, from where a detachment crossed
                        the Cove Mountain to McConnellsburg and struck down the valley from there.
                        The main body however was divided into plundering parties, and scoured the
                        whole southern portion of the county, spending several days in and about
                        Greencastle and Waynesboro, and giving Welsh Run a pretty intimate
                        visitation.</p>
                    <p>Panics.</p>
                    <p>The rebels seemed omnipresent according to reports. They were on several
                        occasions since their departure from this place just about to re-enter it,
                        and the panic-stricken made a corresponding exit at the other side. On
                        Thursday the 18th, they were reported within two miles of here, in large
                        force, and a general skedaddle took place; and again on Sunday, the 21st,
                        they were reported coming with reinforcements. A few ran off, but most of
                        our people, knowing that there was a military force to fall back upon
                        between this and Scotland, shouldered their guns and fell into ranks to give
                        battle.--Prominent among these were noticed Rev. Mr. Niccolls, whose people
                        missed a sermon in his determination to pop a few rebels.</p>
                    <p>Scotland Bridge Burned.</p>
                    <p>One of the first acts done by the rebels here was to march down to the
                        railroad bridge at Scotland and burn it. The warehouse of Mr. Criswell and
                        several cars, were spared upon satisfactory assurance that they were private
                        property. As soon as the rebels fell back, the Railroad Company commenced to
                        rebuild the bridge, and on Sunday evening the 21st, trains passed over it
                        again. The only other instance of firing property that has reached us, was
                        the warehouse of Oaks &amp; Linn. It was fired just as they left the
                        town, but the citizens extinguished it.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Jenkins.</p>
                    <p>We had not the felicity of a personal interview with the distinguised [sic]
                        guerrilla chief but our special reporters took his dimensions and
                        autobiography with general accuracy. He was born of his mother at a very
                        early age, and is supposed to be the son of his father. He was flogged
                        through school in his boyhood years much as other children and may have
                        startling traditions touching his early character, such as the hatchet and
                        cherry tree which proved that Washington could not lie; but it is for the
                        present regarded as doubtful. He subsequently graduated at Jefferson College
                        in this State, in the same class, we believe, with J. McDowell Sharpe, Esq.,
                        and gave promise of future usefulness and greatness. His downward career
                        commenced some five years ago, when in an evil hour he became a member of
                        Congress from Western Virginia, and from thence may be dated his decline and
                        fall. From Congress he naturally enough turned fire- eater, secessionist and
                        guerrilla. He is of medium size, has a flat but good head, light brown hair,
                        blue eyes, immense flowing beard of a sandy hue, and rather a pleasant face.
                        He professes to cherish the utmost regard for the humanity of war, and
                        seemed sensitive on the subject of his reputation as a humane military
                        leader. He pointed to the raids of the Union troops, who left in many
                        instances wide-spread and total desolation on their tracks, and expressed
                        the hope that henceforth the Union raids would do no more damage to citizens
                        than he does. He takes horses, cattle and articles necessary for the army,
                        as both sides treat them as contraband of war, and help themselves on every
                        occasion offered. He pointed with bitter triumph at the raid of Montgomery
                        in South Carolina, and at the destruction of Jacksonville, Fla. and Jackson,
                        Mississippi, by our troops, and reminded us that his actions were in
                        accordance with civilized warfare, while those referred to of our troops
                        were barbarous.</p>

                    <p>We do not learn of any one who was able to count Jenkins' forces accurately,
                        but from the best information we can gather, he had about two thousand men.
                        They were clad, as rebel soldiers usually are, in the southern butter-nut
                        cloth, and without any regard to uniformity. They caried [sic] pistols,
                        rifles and sabres, and are classed as mounted infantry, or independent
                        guerillas, although they are recognized as part of the rebel army. We
                        believe that the plunder became their own private property, instead of the
                        property of the rebel authorities, as is the case with their regular troops.
                        They have thus a double incentive to plunder.</p>
                    <p>Delay in Arming.</p>
                    <p>We have heard much complaint of our people for not rushing to arms and
                        driving the invaders away. It must be remembers that the entire southern
                        half of our county, embracing two-thirds of our population, was occupied by
                        the rebels, who had heavy supporting columns at Williamsport. Every man of
                        ours was threatened hourly at his own door, and concentration was
                        impossible. Our people generally did their duty, but they were required in
                        their respective neighborhoods to picket and protect, in some degree, their
                        stock. A concentration of our men at Chambersburg, or Greencastle, or
                        Mercersburg, would have left 25,000 people with their property entirely
                        defenceless. In the Valley the citizens were under arms, and had the roads
                        barricaded for defence, but the Southern portion of the county is open and
                        unsuitable to defence by small parties.</p>
                    <p>Arrival of New York Troops.</p>
                    <p>On Sunday, 28th, the 8th New York Militia arrived here, having marched from
                        Shippensburg, and they were received with the wildest enthusiasm.
                        Considering that they are on our border in advance of any Pennsylvania
                        regiments, they merit, as they will receive, the lasting gratitude of every
                        man in the Border.</p>
                    <p>The Venerable Greys.</p>
                    <p>The old men of the town organized a company, headed by Hon. George Chambers,
                        for the defence of the town. None were admitted under forty-five. On Monday
                        every man capable of bearing arms had his gun and was in some organization
                        to resist the rebels.</p>

                    <p>The Franklin Repository will henceforth be issued by Alex K. McClure and
                        Henry S. Stoner as Editor and Proprietors. It has been enlarged to its old
                        form of Forty-Eight Columns,--its size thus increased fully one-third, and
                        the paper appears in entirely new and beautiful type. The old terms of Two
                        Dollars per annum in advance, or two dollars and a-half if not paid within
                        the year, have been adopted, from necessity, as no paper of the size of the
                        Repository can possibly be published for less. Indeed, but for the hope that
                        printing paper must in a reasonable time become cheaper than now, we could
                        not venture on the experiment of attempting a first-class local paper at the
                        low rate of two dollars per annum.</p>
                    <p>Able assistance has been secured in the Editorial department, and the Local
                        Items of the county will be given in the fullest possible manner. Able and
                        reliable correspondents have been secured at Washington, Harrisburg and the
                        Eastern cities, and the latest news by Telegraph will be given in each issue
                        down to the date of publication. A full and reliable weekly review of the
                        Markets will always be found in the Repository, and the very latest sales of
                        Flour, Grain &amp;c., will be furnished every Tuesday evening by
                        Telegraph. Local correspondents in different sections of the county have
                        been engaged, who will regularly report the condition of the Crops, and all
                        items of general interest. In short, we hope to make the Franklin Repository
                        the most complete Local, General, and Political journal in the State out of
                        the leading cities. If in this we succeed, and thus merit the patronage of
                        the people of Franklin county, we feel assured that we shall not appeal in
                        vain for their generous support.</p>
                    <p>Politically, the Franklin Repository will, during the war, have but one
                        article of faith--the positive and unconditional
                            re-union of the States under the regularly constituted authorities of
                            the Government.. It will resist alike Disunion and cowardly
                        Compromise with armed treason, as disaster to the living--as dishonor to our
                        heroic dead. It will give a cordial and earnest support to the
                        administrations of President Lincoln and Governor Curtin, and will demand
                        that every possible means within the reach or power of the government, be
                        employed to secure the unity and lasting Peace of the Republic.</p>

                    battle.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>At length the two great opposing armies have met in an open field with the
                        firm resolve to conquer or be destroyed, and the God of battles has given
                        victory to the Union arms.</p>
                    <p>It was no drawn struggle--no doubtful triumph. After three days of the most
                        deadly strife, marked by a heroism on both sides before which Roman story
                        pales, the rebel columns reeled back upon their mountain base defeated,
                        routed, decimated, without heart or hope.</p>
                    <p>Under cover of the night their shattered legions commenced their retreat,
                        hugging the mountains closely for protection, and leaving their thousands of
                        dead to find hospitable graves at the hands of their foe, while other
                        thousands of wounded were left to the humanity of those by whose hands they
                        had fallen. The pathway to their home of desolation and want was marked by
                        the pale and lifeless monuments of their disaster, deserted their ranks and
                        come as suppliants to our doors.</p>
                    <p>Scarcely half the insurgent army is in battle array to-day. Its sullen steps
                        were turned upon the Potomac only to find that the very elements have risen
                        in terrible vengeance against them. Hopeless and dispirited they find the
                        waters dividing them from safety, defy their retreat and the battle of
                        despair must be fought ere repose can be found from the shock of the
                        discomfiture at Gettysburg.</p>
                    <p>Their long broken lines filed through Hagerstown toward Williamsport
                        yesterday, and as the Potomac is impassable, the historic ground of Antietam
                        will doubtless be chosen again by the rebel leader for the last desperate
                        effort for existence. It was there that he learned the bitter lesson of the
                        madness of invasion nearly one years ago, when a defeated, disorganized army
                        assailed and dislodged him. Now the Army of the Potomac marches upon him
                        with the victory of Gettysburg streaming on their banners, and their hearts
                        strengthened by the triumph of the Right, and they will strike with
                        resistless fury upon the invading foe.</p>
                    <p>Mingled with the joy of every loyal heart at this great triumph, will be the
                        deepest sorrow for our fallen heroes. To protect our homes and to preserve
                        our Nationality fifteen thousand of our bravest troops have fallen. They
                        will be mourned as the Republic's noblest sons, and green will be the
                        chaplets woven for them in the memory of every friend of order and
                        government.</p>
                    <p>To Gen. Meade was assigned the cruel task of meeting an invading foe within
                        three days after the command was assigned him. That he did it wisely,
                        heroically, triumphantly, stamps him to- day as the "Great Defender of the
                        Republic!"</p>

                    <p>The battle of Friday was the most desperate, most fierce and decisive of the
                        war. It was commenced at early daybreak on our extreme left by a determined
                        attack by the enemy with musketry and artillery. The attack was met by the
                        Sixth Corps and portions of the First and the Fifth, the Third lying close
                        at hand in reserve. The battle raged fiercely at this point for nearly three
                        hours, when the enemy fell back, yielding to us the
                            whole of the battle field of that morning, as well as of the previous
                            day.</p>
                    <p>Nearly simultaneously with the opening of the attack on the left, movements
                        were discovered on the right indicating that an effort was making to flank
                        our position in that direction. Our artillery on Cemetery Hill at once
                        opened, throwing heavy vollies of shell over and to the right and east of
                        the town. At this point we had eight or ten batteries in position, covered
                        by earthworks. The enemy responded briskly to our cannonading, but with poor
                        effect, and were evidently much annoyed by our fire. They, however, pressed
                        their columns on to the right, and very soon our infantry poured on that
                        flank and were earnestly engaged. The contest here was even more earnest and
                        continuous than on the left. The Twelfth and portions of the Eleventh Corps
                        withstood the shock, giving never an inch of ground to their assailants.</p>
                    <p>The fight raged here on the face of a lofty mountain, densely wooded, from
                        the summit of which batteries could command our position on Cemetery Hill.
                        It was evidently with a view of gaining this position that the enemy made
                        the assault. For this purpose Hill's Corps, that had fought on the left on
                        the previous day, was brought around to reinforce Early, and as the scheme
                        was developed it appeared that the early attack on the left was intended
                        merely as a diversion to cover this movement. From a distance the progress
                        of the fight could be observed by the whirling smoke rising above the woods,
                        marking the line of the fierce contest.</p>
                    <p>In this struggle our reserved artillery was brought into play, and did most
                        excellent service from impromptu positions on the elevated points back of
                        Cemetery Hill shelling the face of the mountain where the enemy were
                        supposed to be. This reserve fire of shell, added to the steady and
                        unflinching ardor of the glorious Twelfth corps, ultimately checked the
                        vastly superior force of the enemy, who for an hour or two had been
                        gradually advancing. At the critical juncture, about eleven o'clock in the
                        forenoon, one or two brigades of New York troops, supposed to be militia
                        from Pennsylvania, arrived, and were immediately thrown into position to
                        reinforce the right wing, which was being so badly pressed. This assistance
                        determined the fate of the day. The enemy quailed before it, and soon the
                        curling smoke that marked the line of the contest began to recede, surely
                        indicating that the enemy were falling back; but if they gave away at all it
                        was but slowly fighting at every step; and thus the battle raged for hours,
                        and until afternoon, when the enemy abandoned the field in that direction.
                        But they did not yet yield the day. For a period hostilities seemed to be
                        suspended; but the suspension was very brief.</p>
                    <p>The rebel columns seemed to be massed as if by magic, and within an hour
                        their whole force was massed directly in our front, and once more the fierce
                        and deadly contest opened. This time it was an assault along the entire
                        line--a last resort, the forlorn hope of the enemy. They were weakened in
                        numbers and dispirited and utterly demoralized; yet Lee had a reputation to
                        save and a name to make, and at any sacrifice of life he seemed bound to win
                        the day; but he strove in vain. The Union troops were fighting at home and
                        among their own people. They fought like heroes, and, inspirited by success,
                        they had no thought of defeat. They could have withstood three times the
                        force the enemy hurled against them. It was mere play for them to drive back
                        the columns of the rebels, and so they did drive them back, and at five
                        o'clock, after more than twelve hours constant fighting, the contest
                        terminated, the national troops victorious at every point, and having nearly the entire battle field in their
                            possession.</p>
                    <p>Time fails me to dwell upon the details of this brilliant and glorious
                        battle. It would be interesting to say how we took thousands on thousands of
                        prisoners, how the enemy were slaughtered, how our men fell by thousands,
                        heroically defending their national emblem; but let [illegible] this be
                        deferred: the day is ours, the victory is won, the
                            country is saved.</p>
                    <p>At the close of the action General Lee had the impudence to send in a flag of
                        truce asking a suspension of hostilities, to give him time for the burial of
                        the dead and an exchange of prisoners. General Meade replied that he intended to recapture all the prisoners the enemy had
                            taken and that he would bury their dead for them. Failing in this
                        attempt to gain time, and badly worsted at all hands, the rebels had no
                        other recourse but to avail themselves of the fast approaching night to fall
                        back to the mountains. So precipitate was their retreat last night that
                        their guards and sentinels in town were not relieved, and were captured.</p>
                    <p>This morning upward of eleven hundred stragglers were taken in Gettysburg,
                        besides our wounded who had fallen into the enemy's hands on Wednesday. At
                        early daybreak General Pleasant was started in pursuit of the rebels with
                        his artillery, and at last accounts was pressing them hard.</p>
                    <p>The summary of this battle it would be difficult to give at this time. Both
                        sides have lost heavily. The country about Gettysburg is crowded with
                        wounded men. Every house and barn is a hospital. Probably in the aggregate
                        of both armies at least 50,000 men have been placed hors
                            de combat. The apportionment of this loss would probably be
                        twenty thousand Union and thirty thousand rebels. In addition to this, we have captured from twelve to twenty thousand prisoners,
                            which is more than quadruple what they have taken from us, including our
                            wounded who fell into their hands on Wednesday, and who were recaptured
                            by us in Gettysburg this morning.</p>
                    <p>It is exceedingly doubtful if we have taken either Longstreet or Hill, as
                        reported, though the report is based upon statements of rebel prisoners.
                        Other reports say that Longstreet is badly wounded and some say that he is
                        dead.</p>
                    <p>The Opening Fight.</p>
                    <p>First Army Corps, <br>Gettysburg, Pa., July 1--12 p.m.</p>
                    <p>We left camp this morning for this place, and before we reached the heights
                        overlooking the town we heard the guns which told us that Buford's cavalry
                        and howitzers were skirmishing with the enemy's advance, about three miles
                        to the westward of the town. Our information is, that the enemy is there in
                        force, with the prospect of a sharp engagement, if not a decisive battle.</p>
                    <p>Communication Cut Off.</p>
                    <p>I came directly into town, hoping to be able to despatch letters or messages,
                        but learn that a few days since the railway was torn up and bridges burned
                        by the rebels, and the telegraph poles cut down for some miles. If no mails
                        leave to-day we shall be obliged to send couriers to the nearest telegraph
                        station.</p>
                    <p>In Position.</p>
                    <p>The First and Eleventh corps have got into position and the firing has ceased
                        for the moment.</p>
                    <p>Headquarters, July l--1 P.M.</p>
                    <p>The First Corps Engaged.</p>
                    <p>I have just returned from the front. There has been some of the most gallant
                        fighting by our boys ever known to warriors. Gen. Jas. S. Wadsworth's
                        division, the [illegible] of the First corps, was the first engaged, and
                        Sol. Meredith's old "iron" brigade was the first to get into action. The
                        boys walked into the fight just as they would into a harvest field, and
                        mowed down the enemy like grass.</p>
                    <p>Capture of Archer's Brigade--Death of Reynolds.</p>
                    <p>They have captured the famous Light Brigade of the rebel army, commanded by
                        Gen. Archer, a native of Maryland, who is also a prisoner, but they have
                        lost their favorite commander. Major General John F. Reynolds, who was
                        killed at the commencement of the action. As you will get all the
                        particulars of his death and career by telegraph, I will not elaborate upon
                        them here more than to say that his troops had every confidence in him and
                        will revere his loss.</p>
                    <p>Headquarters, July 1--6 PM <br>The Rebels Again Attack Us--The First Fully
                        Engaged.</p>
                    <p>In the brilliant little action mentioned in my previous letter, our troops
                        were victorious, having driven the enemy from their position. They were
                        resting on their arms when about two o'clock the enemy, A. P. Hill's corps,
                        having been reinforced by portion of Ewell's (formerly Stonewall Jackson's)
                        corps made an attack on our lines. The whole of the First corps was now
                        fiercely engaged. General Robinson, commanding the Second division and Gen.
                        Rowley the Third. The enemy massed his whole force first upon our right,
                        then upon centre, and lastly upon our left, and the iron hail and missiles
                        fell upon us in unparalleled fury. Our boys never winced or flinched. It
                        seems that the veterans of the First corps consider fighting one of their
                        regular exercises.</p>
                    <p>The First Corps Falls Back.</p>
                    <p>After two hours of unprecedented fighting against a force of four times our
                        numbers, and terrible losses, we were obliged to fall back upon the town,
                        and through it to the heights, on the southern and eastern side, leaving our
                        dead on the field and our wounded, both there and in the town hospitals, who
                        were unable to walk, in the hands of the enemy. Our ambulance train was not
                        yet up.</p>
                    <p>Position and Plan of the Battle.</p>
                    <p>The battle of Gettsburg! [sic] I am told that it commenced on the first of
                        July, a mile north of the town, between two weak brigades of infantry and
                        some doomed artillery, and the whole force of the rebel army. Among other
                        costs of this error was the death of Reynolds. Its value was priceless,
                        however, though priceless was the young and the old blood with which it was
                        bought. The error put us upon the defensive, and gave us the choice of
                        position, from the moment that our artillery and infantry rolled back
                        through the main street of Gettysburg and rolled out of the town to the
                        circle of eminences south of it. We were not to attack but to be attacked.
                        The risks, the difficulties and the disadvantages of the coming battle were
                        the enemy's. Ours were the heights for artillery; ours the short, inside
                        lines for manoeuvering [sic] and reinforcing; ours the cover of stonewalls,
                        fences, and the crests of hills. The ground upon which we were driven to
                        accept battle was wonderfully favorable to us. A proper description of it
                        would be to say that it was in form an elongated and somewhat sharpened
                        horseshoe, with the toe to Gettysburg and the heel to the south.</p>
                    <p>Lee's plan of battle was simple. He massed his troops upon the east side of
                        this shoe of position, and thundered on it obstinately to break it. The
                        shelling of our batteries from the nearest overlooking hill, and the
                        unflinching courage and complete discipline of the Army of the Potomac
                        repelled the attack. It was renewed at the point of the shoe--renewed
                        desperately at the southwest heel--renewed on the western side, with an
                        effort consecrated to success by Ewell's earnest oaths, and on which the
                        fate of the invasion of Pennsylvania was fully put at stake. Only a perfect
                        infantry, and an artillery educated in the [illegible] of charges of hostile
                        brigades, could possibly have sustained this assault. Hancock's corps did
                        sustain it, and has covered itself with immortal honors, by its constancy
                        and courage. The total wreck of Cushing's battery--the list of its killed
                        and wounded--the losses of officers, men and horses Cowen sustained, and the
                        marvellous [sic] outspread upon the board of death, of dead soldiers and
                        dead animals--of dead soldiers in blue, and dead soldiers in gray--more
                        marvellous to me than anything I have ever seen in war--are a ghastly and
                        shocking testimony to the terrible fight of the 2d Corps, that none will
                        gainsay. That corps will ever have the distinction of breaking the pride and
                        power of the rebel invasion.</p>
                    <p>The Rebel Charge.</p>
                    <p>Then were was a lull and we knew that the rebel infantry was charging. And
                        splendidly they did this [illegible]--the highest and severest test of the
                        stuff that soldiers are made of. Hill's division in line of battle, came
                        first, on the double-quick, their muskets [illegible] the "right-
                        shoulder-shift." Longstreet's came as the support, at the usual distance,
                        with war cries and a savage insolence as yet untutored by defeat. They
                        rushed in perfect order across the open field, up to the very muzzles of the
                        guns, which tore lanes through them as they came. But they met men, who were
                        their equals in spirit, and their superiors in tenacity. There never was
                        better fighting since Thermopylae than was done yesterday by our infantry
                        and artillery. The rebels were over our defences. They had cleaned
                        cannononiers and horses from one of the guns, and were whirling it around to
                        use upon us. The bayonet drove them back. But so hard pressed was this brave
                        infantry that at one time, from the exhaustion of their ammunition, every
                        battery upon the principal crest of stock was silent, except Cowen's. His
                        service of grape and canister was awful. It enabled our line, outnumbered
                        two to one, first to beat back Longstreet, and then to charge upon him, and
                        take a great number of his men and himself prisoners. Strange sight! So
                        terrible was our musketry and artillery fire, that when Armstead's brigade
                        was chocked [sic] in its charge, and stood reeling, all of its men dropped
                        their muskets, and crawled on their hands and knees underneath the stream of
                        shot, till close to our troops, where they made signs of surrendering. They
                        passed through our ranks scarcely noticed and slowly went down the slope to
                        the road in the rear.</p>
                    <p>Spirit of the Battle.</p>
                    <p>[From Correspondence of the World.]</p>
                    <p>The artillery fire continued without intermission for three hours, when
                        suddenly, having formed under cover of the smoke of their own guns, the
                        rebel troops were hurled against our lines by the officers in masses, the
                        very tread of whose feet shook the declivity up which they [illegible], with
                        cries that might have caused less dauntless troops than those who awaited
                        the [illegible] to break with terror. Not a man in the Federal ranks
                        flinched from his position. Not an eye turned to the right or left in search
                        of security, not a hand trembled as the long array of our heroes grasped
                        their muskets at a charge, and waited the order to fire. On and up came the
                        enemy, hooting, [illegible] showing their very teeth in the venom of their
                        rage, until within thirty yards of our cannon. As the turbulent mass of gray
                        uniforms, of flashing bayonets and gleaming eyes, lifted itself in a last
                        lap forward almost to the mouths of our guns, a volley of shot, shell,
                        shrapnel and bullets went crashing through it, leaving it as a scythe. Its
                        overwhelming onward rush was in the next instant turned to the hesitating
                        leap forward of a few soldiers more daredevil than the rest, the wild
                        bounding upwards of more than a few mortally wounded heroes, and the
                        succeeding backward surge of the disjointed remainder, which culminated in a
                        scamper down the slope that was, in some instances, retarded by the pursuing
                        bullets of our men.</p>
                    <p>The carnage of the assault among the rebels was so fearful that even Federal
                        soldiers who rested on their arms triumphant, after the foe had retreated
                        beyond their fire, as they case their eyes downward upon the panorama of
                        death and wounds illuminated by the sun that shone upon the slope before
                        them, were seen to shudder and turn sickening away.</p>
                    <p>Then the 3rd and 5th Corps joined in the fight. As the rebels rallied for an
                        instant, and attempted to make a stand, they were met by such combined
                        volleys as threatened to reduce their columns to fragments. The panic which
                        ensued is unparalleled in any battle in which the Army of the Potomac has
                        ever been engaged. The enemy quailed like ewes before a tempest. Their main
                        line again receded, but numbers, palsied by the horror and tumult, fell upon
                        their faces, shrieking and lifting up clasped hands in token of surrender
                        and appeals for mercy. General Dick Garnett's brigade surrendered almost
                        entire, but Garnett himself, by the aid of two of his men, succeeded, though
                        wounded, in making his escape. Longstreet, who led the reinforcements which
                        enabled the rebels to make their second brief stand, was wounded, captured
                        and is now prisoner. The musketry firing slowly ceased and the discharge of
                        artillery continued for a brief period, but even these reverberations died
                        away.</p>
                    <p>General Mead was not deceived in anticipating another onslaught. Lee's
                        columns were collected and reformed with magical haste. With an hour what
                        seemed to be his whole force was again amassed directly in our front, where
                        the contest once more opened. The assault this time was made with a fury
                        even surpassing that of the first. It would seem as if the entire rebel army
                        had resolved itself to a gigantic forlorn hope, and bore in its collective
                        bosom the consciousness that the effort now made was the last and only one
                        that could be made toward retrieving the fortunes of that army, or
                        preventing the inevitable disgrace which hovered over it.</p>
                    <p>It is said by rebel prisoners taken in the later part of the engagement that
                        this charge was led by Lee in person. The prestige of his name and his
                        presence could certainly not have added to its power or enthusiasm. Yet the
                        cool and gallant phalanx which, secure in its position and confident in its
                        leader, waited with a silence only broken by the occasional roar of
                        artillery the approach of the foe, and view [illegible] it as calmly and met
                        it as unfalteringly [illegible] before. Back, as easily as a girl hurls the
                        shuttlecock, did the solders of our gallant army hurl into chaotic retreat
                        the hosts that came on and on, over the stones and ditches, over the bodies
                        of fallen comrades, piling its dead in heaps and making the soil over which
                        it trod ghastly and alive with struggling wounded.</p>
                    <p>The Field After the Battle.</p>
                    <p>[From the Correspondence of the Times.]</p>
                    <p>Rebel officers with whom I have conversed frankly admit that the result of
                        the last two days has been most disastrous to their cause, which depended,
                        they say, upon the success of Lee's attempt to transfer the seat of war from
                        Virginia to the Northern Border States. A wounded rebel colonel told me
                        that, in the first and second days's fight, the rebel losses were between
                        ten and eleven thousand. Yesterday, they were greater still. In one part of
                        the field in a space not more than twenty feet in circumference, in front of
                        General Gibbons' division, I counted seven dead rebels, three of whom were
                        piled on top of each other. And close by, in a spot not more than fifteen
                        feet square, lay fifteen "graybacks," stretched in death. These were the
                        adventurous spirits, who, in the face of the horrible stream of canister,
                        shell, and musketry, scaled the fence wall in their attempt upon our
                        batteries. Very large numbers of wounded were also strewn around, not to
                        mention more who had crawled away or been taken away. The field in front of
                        the stone wall was literally covered with dead and wounded, a large
                        proportion of whom were rebels. Where our musketry and artillery took effect
                        they lay in swaths as if mown down by a scythe. This field presented a
                        horrible sight--such as has never yet been witnessed during the war. Not
                        less than one thousand dead and wounded lay in a space
                            of less than four acres in extent, and that, too, after numbers
                        had crawled away to places of shelter.</p>
                    <p>The Pennsylvania Reserves have always fought well. They fought today more
                        than well. Defending the State of their nativity not only inspired the men
                        with extra courage, but many lived in Gettysburg and about here, and with
                        them it was a fight in reality for their hearths and firesides. Over the
                        heads of their helpless wives and children were passing murderous shells of
                        the rebel invaders. At any moment these shells might fall into their midst,
                        carrying horror and death in their track. Is it to be wondered at that they
                        climbed in the manner they did the rugged ascent of Rock Hill--that they
                        showed no fear of the rebels--that they drove the enemy from the hill, and
                        kept them at bay? And they did keep them at bay, and, by aid of two
                        batteries planted on the summit of the hill are still doing so.</p>
                    <p>The record of the 3d Corps shows numberless chief officers sacrificed in this
                        fierce encounter, witnessing the desperation with which it was fought. Out
                        of this little Corps nearly 8,000 men were placed hors
                            de combat in this short engagement.</p>
                    <p>The gallant Birney was twice struck by the bullets of the enemy, though
                        happily but slightly injured. It is but proper to mention that this single
                        acted saved us the day.</p>
                    <p>Hancock's Valor.</p>
                    <p>From the Correspondence of the Times.</p>
                    <p>At 2 o'clock, P. M. on Friday, Longstreet's whole Corps advanced from the
                        rebel centre against our centre. The enemy's forces were hurled upon our
                        position by columns in mass, and also in lines of battle. Out centre was
                        held by Gen. Hancock, with the noble old 2d Army Corps, aided by General
                        Doubleday's division of the 1st Corps.</p>
                    <p>The rebels first opened a terrific artillery bombardment, to demoralize our
                        men, and then moved their forces with great impetuosity upon our position.
                        Hancock received the attack with great firmness, and after a furious battle,
                        lasting until five o'clock, the enemy were driven from the field, Long
                        street's Corps being almost annihilated.</p>
                    <p>The battle was a most magnificent spectacle. It was fought on an open plain
                        just south of Gettysburg, with not a tree to interrupt the view. The courage
                        of our men was perfectly sublime.</p>
                    <p>At 5 P.M., what was left of the enemy retreated in utter confusion, leaving
                        dozens of flags, and Gen. Hancock estimated, at least five thousand killed
                        and wounded on the field.</p>
                    <p>The battle was fought by General Hancock with a splendid valor. He won
                        imperishable honor, and Gen. Meade thanked him in the name of the army and
                        the country. He was wounded in the thigh, but remained on the field.</p>
                    <p>Head-quarters Army of the Potomac, <br>July 3d, 8:30, near Gettysburg.--To
                        Maj. Gen. Halleck, Commander-in-Chief.</p>
                    <p>--The enemy opened at 1 P. M., from about 100 guns concentrated upon my left
                        centre, continuing without intermission for about three hours, at the
                        expiration of which time he assaulted my left centre twice. Being, upon both
                        occasions, handsomely repulsed with severe loss to him, leaving in our hands
                        nearly 3000 prisoners, among them being Gen. Armistead and many Colonels and
                        officers of lesser note.</p>
                    <p>The enemy left many dead upon the field, and a large number of wounded in our
                        hands.</p>
                    <p>The loss upon our side has been considerable. Major General Hancock and
                        Brigadier General Gibbon were wounded.</p>
                    <p>After the repelling of the assault, indications leading to a belief that the
                        enemy might be withdrawing, an armed reconnaissance was pushed forward from
                        the left, and the enemy found to be in force.</p>
                    <p>At the present hour all is quiet.</p>
                    <p>My cavalry have been engaged all day on both flanks of the enemy, harassing
                        and vigorously attacking him with great success, notwithstanding they
                        encountered superior numbers, both of cavalry and infantry.</p>
                    <p>The army is in fine spirits.</p>

                    <p>I shall probably be able to give you a return of our captures and losses
                        before night, and a return of the enemy's killed and wounded in our hands.</p>

                    <p>--To Major General Halleck:</p>

                    <p>In another part of to-day's paper we give a detailed account of the
                        occupation of this county by the Rebel Chieftain Jenkins. It was written
                        after his departure, and its publication delayed by the occupation of our
                        valley by the entire Rebel Army a few days afterwards.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Jenkin's Return.</p>
                    <p>On Tuesday, the 22nd ult., Gen Jenkin's guerrillas returned to Chambersburg,
                        as the advance of Gen. Lee's entire army. He demeaned himself as before and
                        restrained his troops generally from serious acts of wantonness. It was
                        evident, however, that he was but the forerunner of the whole rebel legions,
                        and on Wednesday</p>
                    <p>General Ewell Arrived.</p>
                    <p>With him came the first column of rebel infantry that had ever penetrated a
                        free State. Gen. Ewell is a graduate of West Point, and was for some time a
                        civil engineer on the Columbia Railroad in this State. While thus engaged he
                        married Miss McIlvaine of York, who has since separated from him and lives
                        in Eastern Maryland. Soon after the commencement of the Rebellion he joined
                        the rebel cause, and has risen, we believe justly, to the position of one of
                        their first generals. He lost a leg at the second battle of Bull Run, and
                        when he rides on horse-back is always strapped to his horse. His corps is
                        Jackson's old command, and numbers about 20,000 men.</p>
                    <p>The Rebel Infantry.</p>
                    <p>There is a marked difference between the character of the rebel infantry and
                        cavalry. The latter are, as a class, superior men in all respects, and
                        generally well-behaved, while the infantry seem to have no conceptions above
                        eating, sleeping, fighting and stealing. Their dress consisted of every
                        style and color. Some had butter-nut cloth, some half Union uniforms, and
                        some every possible mixture of hoes and fashions. Indeed they were not
                        uniform in anything but dirt, impudence, thieving, lice and implacable
                        hatred for the "Yankees."</p>

                    <p>The rebel rank and file when here were exceedingly jubilant but the officers,

                        propensities. They did [illegible] doubt that they would go into Harrisburg

                        To the Authorities Chambersburg, Pa:
                    </p>
                    <p>By direction of Lt. Gen. R. S. Ewell, I require the following articles:

                    <p>Headquarters [illegible] Army Corps, <br>[illegible] 24th, 1863.</p>
                    <p>By command of Lt. Gen. R. S. Ewell, the citizens of Chambersburg will furnish
                        the following articles, by 3 o'clock this afternoon.</p>
                    <p>6,000 lbs. lead. <br>10,000 lbs. harness leather. <br>50 boxes tin.

                    <p>Wm. [illegible], M. And C.</p>
                    <p>Subsequently another requisition was sent in for the following articles:
                        <br>50,000 lbs. bread. <br>100 sacks salt. <br>30 bbls. molasses.
                        <br>500 bbls. flour. <br>25 bbls. vinegar. <br>25 bbls. beans. <br>25
                        bbls. dried fruit. <br> 25 bbls. sour kraut. <br>25 bbls. potatoes.
                        <br>11,000 lbs. coffee. <br>10,000 lbs. sugar. <br>100,000 lbs. hard
                        bread.</p>
                    <p>A meeting of the citizens was called and it was resolved that the demand
                        would not be complied with for many reasons--but mainly perhaps because the
                        town had not one-third the articles required in it. The rebels then
                        proceeded to help themselves, in some instances, pretending to pay in rebel
                        scrip; but in fact plundering the town relentlessly. An officer, said to be
                        Major Todd, bother of Mrs. Lincoln, took charge of the stealing operations,
                        and well nigh lost his head several times by some of our enraged ladies who
                        resisted his searches.</p>
                    <p>Hill's Corps Arrives.</p>
                    <p>The last of Ewell's Corps came Wednesday, and on Thursday and Friday Hill's
                        corps arrived, putting more than half of the entire rebel army in the
                        neighborhood of Chambersburg. They encamped all along the Greencastle and
                        Fayettville roads, and wherever they stopped, the desolation was complete.
                        We hope hereafter to give a most detailed account of the desolation that
                        followed their fatal tread.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Lee Arrives.</p>
                    <p>On Saturday Gen. Lee and Staff reached this place, and the Commander-in-Chief
                        seems to think the beautiful grove of Mr. Shetter, a mile East of town, a
                        more healthy location for him than the borough of Chambersburg. He pitched
                        his tent there, and in that heartsome grove was planned the most sanguinary,
                        and to him the most fatal, battle, of this sanguinary war. He spent several
                        days there, as if uncertain what his movement should be; but his original
                        plans were evidently disconcerted by the rapid march of Meade; and he was
                        compelled to call in his force, from every point, to secure a good position
                        of the South Mountain from which he could give battle. With almost
                        incredible haste he summoned his forces to the Gettysburg road from York,
                        Carlisle, Hancock, McConnelsburg, Chambersburg, and by Thursday his infantry
                        were gone to meet the fearful retribution in store for them at Gettysburg.
                        Imboden's Cavalry had passed Thursday, and on Friday the rear guard, under
                        Jones, had passed through to witness the defeat of their chieftain. In all,
                        Lee passed some 47,000 men and 193 guns through this place, and Longstreet's
                        Corps, the largest in his command, went to Gettysburg direct from Hagerstown
                        by Waynesboro. Gen. Lee is about fifty-two years of age, stout built, of
                        medium height, hair gray, and rough gray beard. He is a quiet, thoughtful
                        man, always courteous, and as a commander, seems to aim at restraining the
                        passion and thieving propensities of his troops within the rules of war. He
                        issued two orders on the subject, which exhibited considerable earnestness
                        on his part to maintain the reputation of himself and army. All the orders
                        issued during the rebel campaign will be given in our next issue.</p>
                    <p>Railroad Bridges Destroyed.</p>
                    <p>On Wednesday morning the destruction of the Railroad building began; and they
                        were completely demolished by undermining the foundations and battering down
                        the walls. The destruction is complete, and considerable damage is done to
                        the road. The Scotland bridge was burnt [illegible] and the rails have been
                        torn up in many places.</p>
                    <p>The March North.</p>
                    <p>Shippensburg, [illegible], Carlisle and Mechanicsburg were successively
                        occupied by the rebel forces, and Gen. Early took possession of York and so
                        threatened Columbia that Col. Frick withdrew his men and burned the bridge.
                        Gen [illegible] threatened Harrisburg for several days and could have
                        captured it with little difficulty had he moved promptly; but he was
                        intimidated by the assurance received on [illegible] hand that Gens. Couch,
                        McClellan, Sigel, and any number of troops were there to defend it. Gen.
                        Couch was there alone, with but few militia; but he never faltered in his
                        determination to defend the capitol to the last. It is now well fortified,
                        and in addition to the army of Gen. Smith that he has sent to swell the
                        columns of Gen. Meade, he had enough left to guard the line of the
                        Susquehanna in any event.</p>
                    <p>Lee's Second Invasion of Franklin.</p>
                    <p>On Wednesday Lee gave battle to Mead's advance, and gained a temporary
                        advantage by his superior numbers; but on Thursday and Friday he hurled his
                        battalions against the lines of our troops time and again, only to see them
                        fall back in confusion and decimated by the rich harvest of death. On Friday
                        night, exhausted, defeated, demoralized and the flower of his army numbered
                        with the dead or writhing in the agony of ghastly wounds, and left to the
                        mercy of his foe, for care and spulchre, Lee made his second invasion of
                        Franklin county. With sullen, heavy step his fragments re-crossed the South
                        Mountain and took the shortest route thro' the hills for the Potomac. Once
                        there, we hope to hear again has he met the Union legions he so willingly
                        sought when he landed on the free soil of the North, and that the remnants
                        of his armed traitors have been destroyed [illegible] captured. At the time
                        of this writing we have no word of Meade having reached Lee on the line of
                        the Potomac, but we know that the gallant Meade is pursuing him swiftly, and
                        that he will stroke with resistless fury whenever he reaches the retreating
                        foe. God crown with final victory the great cause of American Nationality!</p>
                    <p>Stealing Negroes.</p>
                    <p>Quite a number of negroes were stolen by the army of Gen. Lee, and evidently
                        with the sanction of officers. All ages and condition were taken and carried
                        off to their rear, and as they were taken past rebel encampments, cheer
                        after cheer would go up at the triumph of the negro- stealers. But few were
                        taken off, however, as the negroes in many instances escaped, and so
                        hurriedly did the columns move from here that a number were forgotten.</p>
                    <p>The Rebel Retreat.</p>
                    <p>The rebel retreat, notwithstanding the fatal disaster at Gettysburg, was
                        conducted with comparative order, although thousands of dispirited soldiers
                        deserted their ranks and are now concealed in the mountains. Many of their
                        wounded were taken with them. Reliable men report that they took from 10,000
                        to 12,000 wounded through Greencastle on Sunday and Monday last. Their train
                        commenced to pass there on Sunday morning at 4 A.M., and continued until 11
                        A. M. Monday. All along the roads, over which their several columns passed,
                        wounded have been found--some helpless, others dying, and many dead. The
                        inexorable laws of war, requiring the lives and care of wounded to be
                        subordinated to the safety of the remnant of the army, left these poor
                        wretches uncared for and apparently unpitied, to die and find hospitable
                        graves in the land they sought to desolate.</p>

                        adopted by its founder seventy years ago--The Franklin Repository. With this
                        name it was published by George K. Harper Esq., for nearly half a century,
                        and enjoyed a degree of popular confidence and patronage which, in those
                        days, was unparalleled in rural journalism. For many years, we believe that
                        Hon. George Chambers was its chief Editorial contributor, although his name
                        did not appear, nor had he any pecuniary interest in the enterprise. When
                        the Anti-Masonic element became the predominating power opposed to the
                        Democracy, Mr. Raper did not harmonized with it--he being an adhering Mason.
                        The Chambersburg Whig was founded by Joseph
                        Pritts, Esq., we believe, and his erratic but gifted pen made his journal a
                        formidable rival; but as the political elements opposed to Democracy
                        combined, the Whig was prudently united with the
                        Repository, and the title of the paper became the Repository and Whig. Subsequently the Franklin Intelligencer was founded by Mr. Mish, and published
                        for some time with indifferent success, when it was also united with the
                            Repository and Whig. The Transcript was the
                        next candidate for popular favor. It was founded by R. P. Hazelet Esq., with
                        Dr. S. G. Lane as Editor, and was neutral in politics. The American movement
                        appeared on the surface soon after, and it engulfed The
                            Transcript as its organ, with George Eyster, Esq., as its Editor,
                        who infused into it great vigor, and had success been possible would have
                        attained it. In 1855, The Transcript was united
                        with the Repository and Whig, and the paper was
                        issued with the title of Repository and
                        Transcript. In 1861 the Dispatch was
                        founded by G. H. Merklein &amp; Co., as a semi-weekly, and pushed with
                        considerable ability and success. The high price of paper, however, soon
                        rendered a semi-weekly impracticable, and it was reduced to a weekly when
                        the other papers of the town were compelled to diminish in size to avoid
                        bankruptcy. The Dispatch has now been united with
                        this paper, and as it is impossible to preserve any evidence of the
                        existence of all the papers combined with this one, we go back to the
                        familiar old title, and present the Union party to-day [sic] with a journal,
                        worthy, we trust, of their confidence and cordial support. The union is
                        regarded as judicious in every view of the case; and as the Repository has no personal or factious ends to
                        accomplish, but seeks to serve the entire Union party of this section of the
                        State, it will commend itself, by a firm, judicious and independent course,
                        to the intelligent judgment of every lover of the Union cause.</p>

                    <p>--We learn that Mr. Solomon Helser and his son, who were arrested some weeks
                        ago in this place, and by Gen. Schenck sent to Gen. Milroy with orders to
                        send them beyond our lines, have been allowed to return, and are now at
                        home, and have taken the oath of allegiance to the government. It is not
                        publicly known on what specific charges the Helsers were arrested, but we
                        understand that, when with Gen. Milroy, they received a suspension of the
                        sentence of banishment until they could have an opportunity to rebut the
                        charges preferred against them. As they have since been discharged, we infer
                        that the evidence produced either acquitted them, or mitigated the offences
                        materially, and they are entitled to the benefit of a charitable judgment.
                        Mr. Helser should so demean himself now that there may be no question about
                        his loyalty. There can be no neutrals in this war. Neutrality is
                        impossible--indifference criminal.</p>
