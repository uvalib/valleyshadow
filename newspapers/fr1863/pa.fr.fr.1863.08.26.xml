                    <p>Correspondence of the Franklin Repository.</p>
                    <p>Philadelphia, Aug. 22, 1863.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Rosseau made a speech from the balcony of the Continental Hotel, a few
                        nights since, in which he boldly advocated the abolition of Slavery, as an
                        institution that should not exist in an enlightened Government. Slavery had
                        produced the war, and as the perpetuity of the Union with Slavery was
                        impossible, it must be exterminated. The views of Gen. Rosseau are fast
                        becoming those of all loyal Southerners. He is a Kentuckian, and a large
                        slaveholder, who has done good service in this war. The Northern Copperhead,
                        he said was a more dangerous and contemptible individual than the
                        Secessionist, and he administered to them a terrible flagellation. The
                        speech was heard by immense crowd, and was loudly applauded.</p>
                    <p>When slaveholders who understand the cause of our present difficulties, are
                        willing to strike at the root of them, although in so doing they suffer
                        pecuniary loss, and inaugurate to them an untried system of labor, the
                        Northern Copperhead is rendering himself ridiculous by insisting that
                        Slavery, with all its barbarities and wrongs, shall be unharmed, and the
                        union be continued as it was. The Union as it was would be a restoration of
                        all our former ills--Davis, Breckinridge, Toombs &amp; Co. would occupy
                        seats in the U.S. Senate. Floyd, or some kindred spirit, would occupy the
                        War Department, and steal all the public property. Northern sentiment would
                        again be made subservient to Southern despotism, and before the lapse of a
                        score of years, the bloody drama of the last two years would be re-enacted.
                        Whatever else may grow out of this terrible contest, I trust it will not
                        produce "the Union as it was." Let the only disturbing cause be removed, and
                        we will have a Union which will withstand all the attacks of foes from
                        abroad, or traitors within.</p>
                    <p>The regiment of colored troops, which has for some time been recruiting at
                        Chelton Hill, embarked a few days since for Charleston, where, it is not
                        improbable, they have already been engaged in the attack on the
                        fortifications of that doomed city. The troops, when encamped near this
                        city, conducted themselves with great propriety; and many officers, who saw
                        them drill, speak favorably of their soldierly qualifications. The prejudice
                        against the negro, which prevented him early in the war from taking part in
                        the contest, has disappeared entirely, and the people have wisely concluded,
                        that the negro may as well be shot at as the white man.</p>
                    <p>In the Wards where the subject has been disposed of, the exemptions from the
                        draft have been unexpectedly large. The number of men mustered into the
                        service has been so small, that apprehensions of another draft are felt in
                        some quarters, but wish the one hundred thousand contrabands which Adjutant
                        General Thomas expects to have equipped by autumn, this is not likely to
                        occur, in view of the waning proportions of the rebellion.</p>
                    <p>At the primary meetings of the Union party, held in all the Wards of the city
                        on Tuesday night last, the attendance was larger than at any previous
                        p[r]eliminary meetings, within the memory of the oldest inhabitants. Many of
                        the substantial citizens who never take any active part in political affairs
                        were there; and many loyal Democrats freely participated in the proceedings.
                        Rely upon it this city is right, and will speak in thunder tones in October
                        against disloyalty.</p>
                    <p>The political campaign was opened this week by a Mass Meeting in the 13th
                        Ward, which was largely attended, and great enthusiasm was manifested. A
                        general ratification meeting will be held at Penn Square, on Wednesday
                        evening next.</p>
                    <p>The State Committee are about to occupy their old quarters in the
                        Commonwealth Buildings, on Chestnut Street, where in 1860, the Editor of the
                        Repository, throughout a long and exciting campaign, presided with so much
                        credit to himself, and so much advantage to the party.</p>

                <commentary/>
                <excerpt>"We don't exactly object to the Spirit aiding in the re-election of Gov.
                    Curtin; but we beg to suggest that it tell the truth occasionally--say once a
                    month or so, just for the novelty of the thing, or for the sake of reference."</excerpt>
                <transcript>
                    <p>The <emph rend="italic">Spirit</emph> is out for Curtin. True, it don't just
                        exactly say that it wants him re-elected, nor does it cultivate the chaste
                        and endearing in framing its compliments; but it's the <emph rend="italic"
                            >Spirit's</emph> way, and we must take things as we find them when we
                        can't make them better. Persons who don't understand that journal might call
                        it vituperative in the highest degree, and declare it given to falsifying
                        with a recklessness almost without a parallel; but things sometimes work by
                        contraries, and the <emph rend="italic">Spirit</emph> is one of that kind.
                        Probably it was called into being in the sign of the crab, and can't help
                        hoofing and clawing, because its nature forbids a straight forward movement
                        either in theory or practice.</p>
                    <p>In its last issue it thus, in its own peculiar way, compliments Gov. Curtin's
                        administration:</p>
                    <p>"It was thus 'faithful' when its sharks and harpies furnished 'shoddy'
                        clothing which fell to pieces on the first wearing, shoes with pasteboard
                        soles, damaged blankets unable even to withstand the gentle zephyrs of
                        summer, spoiled meat and mouldy crackers, to the brave volunteers who first
                        rushed to the defense of the flag; thus realizing millions of money out of
                        their contracts, enabling them to roll in wealth and luxury; to raise their
                        palatial marble mansions from the earth as if magic; to flash their diamonds
                        in the saloons of pleasure and dissipation; to clothe their persons in the
                        rare goods of Europe and Asia; to live in untold splendor and magnificence,
                        on money plundered from the treasury and withheld from our brave volunteers,
                        while those volunteers were bleeding and dying to preserve the integrity of
                        our institutions."</p>
                    <p>The touching pathos, burning patriotism, brilliancy of delineation, and gems
                        of historic beauty, which flash in dazzling splendor in the foregoing
                        extract, point clearly to the profound political strategy of the <emph
                            rend="italic">Spirit</emph>, by which it means to re-elect Curtin by
                        professing not to do it. Next to praising a man, the best way to make him
                        friends and votes is to flood the community with bewildering defamation and
                        falsehood; and as telling the truth is not exactly in the <emph
                            rend="italic">Spirit's</emph> line, it chooses the way in which it is
                        most proficient to promote Gov. Curtin's election, and exhausts itself in an
                        effort to see how many falsehoods may be crowded in a few lines.</p>
                    <p>Distasteful as is the <emph rend="italic">Spirit's</emph> strategy in seeking
                        the re-election of Governor Curtin we must henceforth regard it an auxiliary
                        in the Union cause and the success of our worthy Executive. Nor is it an
                        anomaly in its position. Somebody must burn their fingers when ches[t]nuts
                        are to be pulled out of the fire, and scavengers are just as necessary to a
                        community as gentlemen; and as the <emph rend="italic">Spirit</emph> has
                        chosen its duty, we can only look to the good it may accomplish and leave it
                        and its infinitesimal conscience to arrange as to the means it employs. Of
                        course it knows that Gov. Curtin never furnished "spoiled meat and mouldy
                        crackers to the brave volunteers," for the reason that they were in the U.S.
                        service, and were supplied by U. States officers; but as it wasn't trying or
                        meaning to tell the truth, it had to assert that he did stare and poison the
                        soldiers for the benefit of contractors, of whose business he had neither
                        control or knowledge. Of course it knows that the "shoddy," "damaged
                        blankets," which were defeated in a tilt with the "gentle zephyrs of
                        summer," and the "shoes with pasteboard soles," so far as supplied by the
                        State, were all furnished in contracts advertised and let to the lowest
                        bidder, and control[l]ed and managed entirely by Quarter Master General
                        Hale, who never voted anything else than a Democratic ticket in his life,
                        and who was Surveyor of the Port under President Pierce. It is also well
                        advised that a committee of the Legislature, headed by that stubborn
                        Democratic Reformer, Mr. Rex, of Montgomery, after hearing all the testimony
                        as to the furnishing of supplies by the State made a unanimous report, under
                        oath, not only acquitting the Governor of all wrong, but commending his
                        zeal, fidelity and integrity in the strongest terms. Still, as the <emph
                            rend="italic">Spirit</emph> means to defame Gov. Curtin into a
                        re-election, it is consistent with itself and its purpose in shutting its
                        eyes to the light of truth, and in drawing bewitching pictures of Oriental
                        splendor, and harrowing up the public soul by portraying monstrous wrongs on
                        the part of remorseless officials.</p>
                    <p>We don't exactly object to the <emph rend="italic">Spirit</emph> aiding in
                        the re-election of Gov. Curtin; but we beg to suggest that it tell the truth
                        occasionally--say once a month or so, just for the novelty of the thing, or
                        for the sake of reference. If it does not, it may want to tell the truth
                        some time, not for the intrinsic merit of the article, but as a matter of
                        interest or policy, and the danger is that nobody will believe it. In last
                        week's editorial page we have been unable to find any material truth save in
                        the date of the paper, and that most likely would have been wrong, but for
                        the fact that there are ten almanacs in the county to every copy of the
                            <emph rend="italic">Spirit</emph> that is circulated, and the odds were
                        too heavy for it. Be moderate neighbor--be moderate.</p>
