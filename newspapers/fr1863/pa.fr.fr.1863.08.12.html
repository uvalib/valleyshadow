<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The 158th regiment of Pennsylvania drafted men returned here to be mustered
                        out of service on Thursday evening last, when the men were furloughed to go
                        home until Monday. On that day they returned and were mustered out by Lieut.
                        C. M'Kibben, U.S. army, and it was expected they would be paid to-day. As
                        soon as paid they will be discharged.</p>
                    <p>This regiment is composed of most of the drafted men of this county--all but
                        one company, we believe, which joined the 165th regiment--and all the
                        drafted men from Cumberland and Fulton. It is conceded on all hands that in
                        point of discipline, efficiency and behavior generally, it was unsurpassed
                        by any regiment in the service. The men, as a class, were of our own best
                        citizens, and they were most fortunate in their officers. Col. David B.
                        M'Kibbin, of the regular army, was entrusted with the command, and while he
                        enforced the most thorough discipline, he commanded the respect and
                        affection of his men. Indeed it has rarely been the fortune of an officer to
                        bring such a high degree of drill and order generally raw troops, and at the
                        same time preserve the ardent attachment of his command. We would indeed
                        that no worse officers than Col. M'Kibbin wore the stars of Brigadiers. He
                        was ably seconded in all his efforts by Lieut. Col. Troxel, of this county,
                        and Maj. Hale, of Cumberland, both efficient, untiring and brave officers.</p>
                    <p>The following is a list of the commissioned officers of the regiment.</p>

                        are from Cumberland, and company H from Fulton.</p>
                    <p>There were forty-four deaths in the regiment during the nine months service;
                        viz--16 from Franklin; 14 from Cumberland, and 14 from Fulton. It is strange
                        that the mortality in a single company from Fulton should equal the
                        mortality in four companies from Cumberland, and nearly equal the mortality
                        in the five Franklin companies; but it is nevertheless true. We subjoin a
                        list of the dead with dates:</p>

                    <p>A number who went out with the 158th were of course discharged during the
                        term of service because of disease and other disabilities, and quite a
                        number deserted. Most of the desertions occurred, however, before the
                        regiment moved from this place, and a large proportion of them were
                        substitutes who doubtless entered the service for the purpose of getting the
                        substitution money and then running off. We give a complete list of the
                        discharges, transfers and desertions from the regiment from the date of its

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A very large and enthusiastic meeting of the Union men was held in the
                        diamond on Monday evening last, under the direction of the Union League of
                        this place. Hon. Wm. D. Kelly, of Philadelphia, was the speaker of the
                        occasion, and he vindicated the cause of the government in a truly masterly
                        and eloquent manner. He is a bold, fluent and most impressive speaker, and
                        is second to none in his ability to grapple great questions and elucidate
                        them triumphantly. He showed clearly to whom must be charged the
                        responsibility of this bloody fraternal war, and also demonstrated that the
                        last lingering hope of the new desponding traitors is in rebel sympathisers
                        in the North who decry negro enlistments, condemn drafts and defy the laws
                        as far as their cowardly instincts permit them. His able speech was a most
                        conclusive vindication of the war policy of the administration, and his
                        appeal to Pennsylvania to maintain her fidelity to the cause of the Republic
                        by the re-election of Gov. Curtin, was most earnest and convincing. The
                        Union men of the "Green Spot" are grateful to Judge Kelly for his address,
                        and bid him God speed in the good work. Resolutions were read by Isaac H.
                        McCauley Esq., endorsing the administration of President Lincoln and the
                        re-nomination of Governor Curtin.</p>

<b>Governor Curtin</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Celebrates the pro-Union record of Governor Andrew G. Curtin's
                    administration, approves of his renomination, and urges his re-election.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The nomination of Gov. Curtin, at Pittsburgh, by more than a two-thirds vote,
                        in the face of the skill and appliances employed to compass the selection of
                        a new and negative man, is a tribute to the Union candidate for Governor
                        such as has rarely if ever been awarded to an Executive officer in
                        Pennsylvania. Some four months ago, for reasons personal to himself, he
                        formally withdrew from the contest, and we are well assured that none
                        regretted more than himself the necessity, as unlooked for as it was
                        imperative, that compelled him to become the Union standard-bearer, or
                        disregard a high and holy duty to his country in an hour of deepest peril.</p>
                    <p>The administration of Gov. Curtin stands out in bold relief in the history of
                        administrations, with none but itself its parallel. Called into power when
                        the dark clouds of fraternal conflict overshadowed us, it had first to
                        withstand the treachery of the faithless, who came in the name of Peace to
                        betray the Republic; and then it had to grapple with appalling, bloody
                        war--a war that aimed with parricidal hands at the vitals of the parent
                        government--a war that has entombed in untimely graves, amidst a Nation's
                        tears, full thirty thousand of Pennsylvania's noblest sons. It came, too, in
                        the deep shadow of financial gloom, when the timid and perfidious alike
                        sought transitory peace and prosperity over the ruins of our Free
                        Institutions.</p>
                    <p>It has done its work. How well, let the fame of Pennsylvania from the
                        Atlantic to the Mississippi; from the Peninsula to Vicksburg; from Roanoke
                        to New Orleans and Port Hudson, inscribe its matchless fidelity to a
                        bleeding country's cause. Scarcely a battle-field but is crimsoned with the
                        blood of our heroic men; scarcely a record of noble deeds and daring
                        sacrifice, but weaves old Pennsylvania in the chaplet of honor. How bravely
                        her sons have fought; how nobly died; how her wounded have been ministered
                        to and solaced by the often unseen but ever present official hand; how her
                        martyrs have found graves in the homes of their kindred--all these stand as
                        historic monuments of the ceaseless care, the patriotic devotion of Andrew
                        G. Curtin to his country and to its defenders. His great State has, in the
                        dignity of its patriotism, answered every call of the government, in peace
                        and with proverbial promptness and in the darkest hour in the history of
                        this bloody drama, when traitors swept in triumph over the patriot army and
                        almost clutched the National Capitol in their murderous embrace,
                        Pennsylvania alone was ready to rescue it, and her now famed Reserve Corps
                        was the only unbroken, undaunted column that stood between treason and its
                        crowning victory.</p>
                    <p>It was the brilliant, the faithful record of Gov. Curtin's administration
                        that triumphed at Pittsburgh--when the light of day is about to dawn upon
                        the Republic as the legitimate fruits of the unfaltering Executives of the
                        loyal States, and when financial prosperity has taken the place of disaster
                        and gloom, the popular heart pointed to there nomination of our present
                        Executive with a distinctness and earnestness that no combination could
                        defy. In obedience to the call of the loyal men of Pennsylvania he is again
                        before the people for their suffrages. The responsible trust has been
                        accepted, and unless Pennsylvanians shall turn upon themselves with suicidal
                        hands, when the Old F[l]ag is about to wave again over a United Republic, he
                        will be chosen by the largest popular majority ever cast in the State.</p>
                    <p>Loyal men! the battle cry is Forward for the Union! Forward for the Flag!
                        Forward for Victory!</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Never before in the history of the war have the traitors of the South so
                        widely felt the utter hopelessness of their bad cause as now. From one end
                        of the so-called Confederacy to the other, there comes up a universal wail
                        of despondency, and the arch-fiend of the bloody drama pleads as if in the
                        midnight despair to have himself sustained still a little longer in his
                        career of crime. He has issued a long proclamation, in which he whines
                        piteously to his lesser comrades in treason to rally to their shattered and
                        despairing ranks, and complains that there is a want of alacrity in
                        responding to the call for men. He grants an entire amnesty to all deserters
                        who may return to the ranks in twenty days.</p>
                    <p>The Richmond papers are now discussing the probable fall of Charleston. They
                        seem to have recognized the hand-writing on the wall, and most reluctantly
                        are preparing to give up the hot-bed of treason. The Enquirer thinks that the loss of Charleston "will be a fatal
                        blow to the Confederacy." So Jeff. Davis said of Vicksburg some months ago,
                        and considering that several other equally fatal blows have been dealt at
                        Helena, at Port Hudson, at Gettysburg, at Tullahoma, &amp;c., how many
                        lives has the bogus Confederacy? The truth is it has received its death blow
                        and wants but a little laying out and a first-class funeral, and the
                        rebellion will be a matter of history. The Enquirer has a significant article on "our domestic traitors"--the
                        men Vallandigham didn't see when in the South--and complains that men boldly
                        demand peace and propose submission. It says that what the South wants is
                        the firm resolution to perish rather than submit upon any terms whatever."
                        The Savannah News is alarmed about Georgia, and
                        insists that unless the people respond with more heart to the call of the
                        Confederacy, Georgia will soon be under Federal rule. The Augusta Constitutionalist thinks that the rebel armies "may
                        be forced to fall back and that invasion will extend itself" and recommends
                        the destruction of all provisions which cannot be removed. The Montgomery
                            Advertiser complains that the Southern people
                        have lost their spirit, and asserts that their companies for home defence,
                        although full on the rolls, do not muster a squad of men. Pemberton's army,
                        paroled by Grant, has pretty much deserted, and the rebel papers are
                        denouncing Pemberton relentlessly because he opened the way for their
                        desertion. The Mobile News says that "Pemberton's
                        army is dispersed and the Texas and Alabama troops have crossed, and the
                        Mississippi river is lost beyond recall." A Memphis dispatch says that all
                        the late rebel papers "denounce the spirit of the people for crying for
                        peace and a return to the Union." The Mobile News
                        says that the people of East Tennessee "have nothing to eat and their
                        sufferings in all other respects are equally severe." Gen. Lee publishes an
                        appeal to his deserters to return and be forgiven, and one of the Southern
                        papers exhorts the ladies to discountenance every man who is not in the
                        army.</p>
                    <p>The Richmond Examiner seems to regard the
                        destruction of the rebel armies as probable, and is putting the best
                        possible face on that last extremity. It says that if their "great armies
                        are destroyed" they will carry on guerrilla warfare on land and on sea. The
                            Enquirer still cries for the blood of Sawyer
                        and Flynn, and denounces Davis as cowardly for not promptly executing them.
                        The Dispatch says that "the capture of Morgan's
                        men is a distressing blow to the Confederacy," and denounces the raid as
                        "rash and fool-hardy." Indeed on all hands, the tone of the rebel papers,
                        and of rebel officers in their proclamations and orders, is that of utter
                        despair, and, however unwillingly they virtually confess that the vital
                        power of the rebellion is broken. Let Union men North stand shoulder to
                        shoulder, and soon we shall again bless the Union of our fathers, re-united
                        and strengthened in the bonds of Unity and Peace.</p>
