     <p>Official Report of Gen. Meade. <br>A Summary of the Results of the Battle.</p>
     <p>Headquarters--Army of the Potomac, Oct. 1. To Gen. Halleck.
      General: I have the honor to submit herewith a report of the operations of this army during
      the month of July, including details of the battle of Gettysburg, which have been delayed by
      failure to receive the reports of the several Corps and Division Commanders, who were severely
      wounded in battle. On the 28th of June I received orders from the President placing me in
      command of the Army of the Potomac. The situation of affairs was briefly as follows:</p>
     <p>The Confederate army, which was commanded by Gen. R. E. Lee, was estimated at over one
      hundred thousand strong. All that army had crossed the Potomac river and advanced up the
      Cumberland Valley. Reliable intelligence placed his advance thus: Ewell's corps on the
      Susquehanna, Harrisburg and Columbia. Longstreet's corps at Chambersburg, and Hill's corps
      between that place and Cashtown.</p>
     <p>The 28th of June was spent in ascertaining the position and strength of the different corps
      of the army, but principally in bringing up the cavalry which had been covering the rear of
      the army in its passage over the Potomac, and to which a large increase had just been made
      from the force previously attached to the defenses of Washington.</p>
     <p>Orders were given on this day to Major Gen. French, commanding at Harper's Ferry, to move
      with seven thousand men to occupy Frederick and the line of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad
      with the balance of his force, estimated at four thousand, to remove and escort public
      property to Washington.</p>
     <p>On the 29th the army was put in motion, and on the evening of that day it was in position,
      the left at Emmettsburg, and the right at New Windsor. Buford's division of Cavalry was on the
      left flank, with his advance at Gettysburg.</p>
     <p>Kilpatrick's division was in the front at Hanover, where he encountered this day Gen.
      Stuart's Confederate cavalry, which had crossed the Potomac at Seneca creek, and passing our
      right flank, was making its way towards Carlisle, having escaped Gregg's division, which was
      delayed in taking position on the right flank, by the occupation of the roads by a column of
      infantry.</p>
     <p>On the 30th the right flank of the army was moved up to Manchester, the left still being at
      Emmettsburg, or in that vicinity, at which place three corps, First, Eleventh and Third, were
      collected under the orders of Major Gen. Reynolds. Gen. Buford having reported from Gettysburg
      the appearance of the enemy on the Cashtown road I some force, Gen. Reynolds was directed to
      occupy Gettysburg.</p>
     <p>On reaching that place on the 1st of July, Gen. Reynolds found Buford's Cavalry warmly
      engaged with the enemy, who had debouched his infantry through the mountains on Cashtown, but
      was being held in check in the most gallant manner by Buford's Cavalry. Major Gen. Reynolds
      immediately moved around the town of Gettysburg, and advanced on the Cashtown road, and
      without a moment's hesitation deployed his advance division, and attacked the enemy, at the
      same time sending orders for the Eleventh Corps, Gen. Howard, to advance as promptly as
      possible.</p>
     <p>Soon after making his disposition for attack, Major Gen. Reynolds fell mortally wounded; the
      command of the First Corps devolving on Major Gen. Doubleday, and the command of the field on
      Major Gen. Howard, who arrived about this time (11:30 A.M.) with the Eleventh Corps then
      commanded by Major Gen. Schurz. Major General Howard pushed forward two divisions of the
      Eleventh Corps, to support the First Corps, now warmly engaged with the enemy, on a ridge to
      the north of the town, and posted his Third Division, with three batteries of artillery, on
      the cemetery ridge, on the south side of the town.</p>
     <p>Up to this time the battle had been with the forces of the enemy debouching from the
      mountain on the Cashtown road, known to be Hill's corps. In the early part of the action the
      success was son the enemy's side. Wadsworth's division of the First corps having driven the
      enemy back some distance, captured numerous prisoners, among them Gen. Archer, of the
      Confederate army.</p>
     <p>The arrival of reinforcementt [sic] to the enemy on the Cashtown road, and the junction of
      Ewell's Corps coming in on the York and Harrisburg roads, which occurred between one and two
      o'clock P.M., enabled the enemy to bring vastly superior forces against both the First and
      Eleventh Corps, outflanking our line of battle and pressing it so severely that about 4
      o'clock P.M. Maj. Gen. Howard deemed it prudent to withdraw these two corps to the Cemetery
      ridge, on the south side of the town, which operation was successfully accomplished; not,
      however, without considerable loss in prisoners, arising from the confusion incident to
      portions of both corps passing through the town, and the men getting, confused in the streets.
      About the time of the withdrawal, Major Gen. Hancock arrived, whom I had despatched to
      represent me on the field, on hearing of the death of Gen. Reynolds.</p>
     <p>In conjunction with Major Gen. Howard, Gen. Hancock proceeded to post the troops on Cemetery
      Ridge and to repel an attack that the enemy made on our right flank. This attack was not,
      however, very vigorous, the enemy seeing the strength of the position occupied, seemed to be
      satisfied with the success he had accomplished, desisting from any further attack this day.</p>
     <p>About 7 o'clock P.M., Major Gens. Slocum and Sickles, with the Twelfth Corps and part of the
      Third, reached the ground, and took post on the right and left of the troops previously
      posted. Being satisfied, from reports received from the field, that it was the intention of
      the enemy to support, with his whole army, the attack already made, and reports from Major
      Gens. Hancock and Howard on the character of the position being favorable, I determined to
      give battle at this point, and early in the evening first issued orders to all corps to
      concentrate at Gettysburg, directing all trains to be sent to the rear at Westminster, at 11
      P.M. first.</p>
     <p>I broke up my head-quarters, which till then had been at Taneytown, and proceed to the
      field, arriving there at 1 A.M. of the second. So soon as it was light I proceeded to inspect
      the position occupied and to make arrangements for posting several corps as they should reach
      the ground.</p>
     <p>By 7 A.M. the Second and Fifth Corps, with the rest of the Third, had reached the ground,
      and were posted as follows: The Eleventh Corps retained its position on Cemetery Ridge, just
      opposite to the town; the First Corps was posted on the right; the Eleventh on an elevated
      knoll connecting with the ridge and extending to the south and east, on which the Twelfth
      Corps was placed, the right of the Twelfth Corps resting on a small stream at a point where it
      crossed the Baltimore pike, and which formed on the right flank of the Twelfth something of an
      obstacle.</p>
     <p>Cemetery Ridge extended in a westerly and southerly direction, gradually diminishing in
      elevation till it came to a very prominent ridge called "Round Top," running east and west.
      The second and Third Corps were directed to occupy the continuation of Cemetery Ridge on the
      left of the Eleventh Corps, and Fifth Corps, pending the arrival [of] the Sixth Corps, was
      held in reserve. While these dispositions were being made the enemy was massing his troops on
      an exterior ridge distant from the line occupied by us from a mile to a mile and a half.</p>
     <p>At 2 P.M. the Sixth Corps arrived, after a march of thirty-two miles, which was accomplished
      from 9 P.M. of the day previous. On its arrival being reported I immediately directed the
      Fifth Corps to move over to our extreme left and the Sixth to occupy its place as a reserve
      for the fight.</p>
     <p>About 3 P.M. I rode out to the extreme left to await the arrival of the Fifth Corps and post
      it, when I found that Maj. Gen. Sickles, commanding the Third Corps, not fully apprehending my
      instructions in regard to the position to be occupied, had advanced, or rather was in the act
      of advancing his corps some half mile or three quarters of a mile in the front of the line of
      the Second Corps on a prolongation when it was designed his corps should rest.</p>
     <p>Having found Maj. Gen. Sickles, I was explaining to him that he was too far in the advance,
      and discussing with him the propriety of withdrawing, when the enemy opened upon him with
      several batteries in his front and his flank, and immediately brought forward columns of
      infantry, and made a vigorous assault. The Third Corps sustained the shock most heroically.
      Troops from the Second Corps were immediately sent by Maj. Gen. Hancock to cover the right
      flank of the Third Corps, and soon after the assault commenced.</p>
     <p>The Fifth Corps most fortunately arrived, and took a position on the left of the Third, Maj.
      Gen. Sykes, commanding, immediately sending a force to occupy "Round Top" ridge where a most
      furious contest was maintained, the enemy making desperate but unsuccessful efforts to secure
      it. Notwithstanding the stubborn resistance of the Third Corps, under Maj. Gen. Birney (Maj.
      Gen. Sickles having been wounded early in the action,) superiority in numbers of corps of the
      enemy enabling him to outflank its advanced position, Gen. Birney was counseled to fall back
      and reform, behind the line originally desired to be held.</p>
     <p>In the meantime, perceiving the great exertions of the enemy, the Sixth Corps, Maj. Gen.
      Sedgwick, and part of the First Corps, to which I had assigned Maj. Gen. Newton, particularly
      Lockwood's Maryland Brigade, together with detachments from the Second Corps, were all brought
      up at different periods, and succeeded, together with a gallant resistance of the Fifth Corps,
      in checking, and, finally, repulsing the assault of the enemy, who retired in confusion and
      disorder about sunset, and ceased any further efforts on our extreme left.</p>
     <p>An assault was, however, made about 8 P.M., on the Eleventh Corps, from the left of the
      town, which was repelled with the assistance of troops from the Second and First Corps. During
      the heavy assault upon our extreme left, portions of the Twelfth Corps were sent as
      reinforcements.</p>
     <p>During their absence the line on the extreme right was held by a very much reduced force.
      This was taken advantage of by the enemy, who, during the absence of Geary's Division of the
      Twelfth Corps, advanced and occupied part of the line.</p>
     <p>On the morning of the third, Gen. Geary, having returned during the night, attacked at early
      dawn the enemy and succeeded in driving him back and reoccupying his former position. A
      spirited contest was maintained all the morning along this part of the line, Gen. Geary,
      reinforced by Wheaton's Brigade of the Sixth Corps, maintained his position and inflicted very
      severe loses on the enemy.</p>
     <p>With this exception our lines remained undisturbed till 1 P.M. on the 3d, when the enemy
      opened from over 125 guns, playing upon our centre and left. This cannonade continued for over
      two hours, when, our guns failing to make any reply, the enemy, ceased firing, and soon his
      masses of infantry became visible, forming for an assault on our left and left centre.</p>
     <p>An assault was made with great firmness, directed principally against the point occupied by
      the Second Corps, and was repelled without considerable loss in prisoners, arising from the
      confusion incident to portions of both corps passing through the town, and the men getting
      confused in the streets. About the time of the withdrawal, Major Gen. Hancock arrived, whom I
      had despatched to represent me on the field, on hearing of the death of Gen. Reynolds.</p>
     <p>In conjunction with Major Gen. Howard, Gen. Hancock proceeded to post the troops on Cemetery

      opened from over 125 guns, playing upon our centre and left. This cannonade continued for over
      two hours, when, our guns failing to make any reply, the enemy ceased firing, and soon his
      masses of infantry became visible, forming for an assault on our left and left centre.</p>
     <p>An assault was made with great firmness, directed principally against the point occupied by
      the Second Corps, and was repelled with equal firmness by the troops of that corps, supported
      by Doubleday's Division and Stannard's Brigade of the First Corps. Du[r]ing this assault both
      Maj. Gen. Hancock, commanding the left centre, and Brig. Gen. Gibson, commanding the Second
      Corps, were severely wounded.</p>
     <p>This terminated the battle, the enemy retiring to his lines, leaving the field strewed with
      his dead and wounded, and numerous prisoners in our hands. Buford's division and cavalry after
      its arduous service at Gettysburg, on the first, was, on the second, sent to Westminster to
      refit and guard our trains. Kilpatrick's Division, that on the 29th, 30th, and 1st had been
      successfully engaging the enemy's cavalry, was, on the 3d, sent on our extreme left, on the
      Emmettsburg road, where good service was rendered in assaulting the enemy's line and occupying
      his attention.</p>
     <p>At the same time Gen. Gregg was engaged with the enemy on our extreme right, having passed
      across the Baltimore pike and Bonaughtown roads, and boldly attacked the enemy's left and
      rear. On the morning of the 4th the reconnaissances developed that the enemy had drawn back
      his left flank, but maintained his position in front of our left, apparently assuming a new
      line parallel to the mountain.</p>
     <p>On the morning of the 5th it was ascertained that the enemy was in full retreat by the
      Fairfield and Cashtown roads. The Sixth Corps was immediately sent in pursuit on the Fairfield
      road, and the cavalry on the Cashtown road, and by Emmettsburg and Monterey passes. The 5th
      and 6th of July were employed in succoring the wounded and burying the dead.</p>
     <p>Major Gen. Sedgwick, commanding the Sixth Corps, having pushed on in pursuit of the enemy as
      far as the Fairfield pass in the mountains, and reporting that Pass as very strong, and one in
      which a small force of the enemy could hold in check and delay considerable time any pursuing
      force, I determined to follow the enemy by a flank movement, and accordingly, leaving
      M'Intosh's Brigade of Cavalry and Neill's Brigade of Infantry to continue harassing the enemy,
      I put the army in motion for Middletown, Md.</p>
     <p>Orders were immediately sent to Maj. Gen. French, at Frederick, to reoccupy Harper's Ferry,
      and to send a force to occupy Turner's pass, in South Mountain. I subsequently ascertained
      that Major Gen. French had not only anticipated these orders in part, but had pushed his
      cavalry force to Williamsport and Falling Waters, where they destroyed the enemy's pontoon
      bridge and captured its guard. Buford was at the same time sent to Williamsport and
      Hagerstown.</p>
     <p>The duty above assigned to the cavalry was most successfully accomplished, the enemy being
      greatly harassed, his trains destroyed and many captures in guns and prisoners made. After
      halting a day at Middletown to procure necessary supplies to bring up trains, the army moved
      through South Mountain, and by the 12th of July was in front of the enemy, who occupied a
      strong position on the heighths [sic] of Marsh Run, in advance of Williamsport.</p>
     <p>On taking this position several skirmishes and affairs had been had with the enemy,
      principally by cavalry, from the Eleventh and Sixth Corps. The 18th was occupied by making
      reconnoissances of the enemy's position and preparations for attack, but on advancing on the
      morning of the 14th it was ascertained he had retired the night previous by a bridge at
      Falling Waters and a ford at Williamsport.</p>
     <p>The cavalry in pursuit overtook the rearguard at Falling waters capturing two guns and
      numerous prisoners. Previous to the retreat of the enemy Gregg's Division of cavalry had
      crossed at Harper's Ferry, and coming up with the rear of the enemy at Charlestown and
      Shepherdstown, had a spirited contest, in which the enemy were driven to Martinsburg and
      Winchester, and pressed and harassed in his retreat.</p>
     <p>Pursuit was resumed by a flank movement of the army, crossing the Potomac at Berlin, and
      moving down Loudon Valley. Cavalry were immediately pushed into several passes of the Blue
      Ridge, and having learned from scouts of the withdrawal of the Confederate army from the lower
      valley of the Shenandoah, the Third Corps, Major Gen. French, in advance, was moved into
      Manassa Gap, in the hope of being able to intercept a portion of the enemy.</p>
     <p>The possession of the Gap was disputed so successfully as to enable the rear-guard to
      withdraw by way of Strasburg, the Confederate army retiring to the Rapidan. Position was taken
      with this army on the line of the Rappahannock, and the campaign terminated about the close of
      July.</p>
     <p>The result of the campaign may be briefly stated, in the defeat of the enemy at Gettysburg,
      their compulsory evacuation of Pennsylvania and, Maryland, and withdrawal from the upper
      valley of the Shenandoah, and the capture of 3 guns, 41 standards and 13,621 prisoners, 24,978
      small arms were collected on the battle-field.</p>
     <p>Our own losses were very severe, amounting, as will be seen by the accompanying return, to
      2834 killed, 13,709 wounded and 6643 missing, in all 28,186.</p>
     <p>It is impossible, in a report of this nature, to enumerate all the instances of gallantry
      and good conduct which distinguished our success on the hard-fought field of Gettysburg. The
      reports of corps commanders and their subordinates, herewith submitted, will furnish all
      information upon this subject.</p>
     <p>I will only add my tribute to the heroic bravery of the whole army, officers and men. which,
      under the blessing of Divine Providence, enabled the crowning victory to be obtained, which I
      feel confident the country will never cease to bear in grateful remembrance.</p>
     <p>It is my duty, as well as my pleasure, to call attention to the earnest efforts and
      cooperation on the part of Maj. Gen. D.H. Couch, commanding the Department of the Susquehanna,
      and particularly to his advance of four thousand men under Brig. Gen. W. F. Smith, who joined
      me at Boonsboro, just prior to the withdrawal of the Confederate army.</p>
     <p>in conclusion, I desire to return my thanks to my staff, general and personal, to each and
      all of whom I was indebted for unremitting activity and most efficient assistance.</p>
     <p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
     <p>Geo. G. Meade, <br>Maj. Gen. Commanding, <br>Brig. Gen. L. Thomas, Adjt. Gen. U.S.A.
      <br>Washington, D.C.</p>
