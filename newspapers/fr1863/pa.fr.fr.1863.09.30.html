<b>The Difficulty At Waynesboro</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Includes a letter by B. M. Morrow, Major 1st Battalion 22nd Cavalry, that
                    responds to accusations that he and other soldiers disrupted a Union meeting in

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Headquarters 1st Battalion 22d Pa. Cav., <br>Camp near Waynesboro, Sept. 24,
                        1863.</p>
                    <p>Editors of the Franklin Repository: Seeing an
                        article in your paper to which I deem it my duty to reply, I hope you will
                        give me space in your columns to make an explanation. On the evening of
                        September 21st, I returned to this place late in the evening from
                        Greencastle, where I had been all day on duty. On my arrival, I found in
                        progress a political meeting, and having at present no voice
                        politically--not having the right of suffrage--I deemed it prudent not to
                        attend. After having my horse cared for, I, accompanied by a gentleman of
                        the town, walked to the further end of town, where we remained some time,
                        and returned to the hotel. I supposed at that time the meeting was almost
                        over. I stepped into the parlor of the hotel and found quite an agreeable
                        company of ladies and gentlemen with whom I was enjoying myself, until a
                        gentleman came in and told me there was a difficulty between some of my men
                        and the citizens, which was the first intimation I had of any soldiers being
                        in the town. I immediately started to the door to enforce my authority as an
                        officer with the soldiers. My reception when arriving at the door was--"He
                        is a traitor," and was struck by two or three persons. At the same time I
                        ordered every soldier to leave the town, and then asked for the person or
                        persons who struck me. No one appearing willing to say who it was, I then
                        found every thing quiet, when I mounted my horse and rode out of town. Now,
                        these are facts that I am prepared to prove at any moment; and I feel
                        confident that you, as gentlemen, will make the necessary correction. It may
                        be necessary to say, as I have since learned, the cheers for M'Clellan were
                        given at the suggestion of some ladies who were in conversation with the
                        soldiers at the time. I do not think their intention was to interrupt or
                        annoy any one--it was done hastily and without thought.</p>
                    <p>As for the term of Copperhead applied to me. I care not, as my attachment to
                        the army for more than two years will give the lie to that.</p>
                    <p>I merely ask to explain, as my character as an officer and a soldier has been
                        brought before the public, and there is nothing a true soldier prizes so
                        high as his character as a soldier and a gentleman.</p>
                    <p>Hoping you will give this a place in your column, I am gentlemen,</p>
                    <p>Very respectfully, <br>Your obedient servant, <br>B.M. Morrow, <br>Major
                        1st Battalion 22d Cavalry.</p>
                    <p>We give Maj. Morrow the benefit of his statement in our column, and if we had
                        before doubted his complicity in the disturbances at the Waynesboro'
                        meeting, his own awkward evasions must settle his guilt, either by direct
                        effort or by tolerating disorder on the part of his command.</p>
                    <p>On one point we are constrained to deny the correctness of Maj. Morow's
                        statement. He did not behave in the quiet,
                        orderly manner he represents. He was intoxicated, as a multitude of most
                        reputable witnesses have testified over their own signatures, and indulged
                        in the most profane and ungentlemanly language to and of the Union men
                        participating in the meeting; and members of his command, who were
                        intoxicated, openly declared that the Major was on a spree and they would do
                        as they pleased. If he had been sober and meant to do his duty, he would not
                        only have ordered the men of his command out of town, as he alleges he did;
                        but his self-respect as an officer, if not his regard for the peace of the
                        town, would have made him enforce the order. He
                        either did not give such an order, or he permitted his command to defy it
                        insolently, for they did not leave town. On the
                        contrary, they remained until the Union meeting was broken up, all the time
                        creating disorder by yelling for "Jolly," "Woodward" and "McClellan," and
                        committed numerous outrageous acts of violence upon citizens. The President
                        of the Union meeting was cut in the neck with a knife, and narrowly escaped
                        a mortal wound, and others were treated with like brutality. And when the
                        Union meeting closed, the soldiers called for Jolly and huzzaed [sic] for
                        Woodward and McClellan, and finally did get one of Maj. Morrow's command to
                        make a regular copperhead speech. Where was the sensitive Maj. Morrow, who
                        as he says, "prizes nothing so high as his character," when all these
                        disgraceful scenes were transpiring? Does he falsify about having ordered
                        his men out of town, or was he too drunk, too copperheadish or too cowardly
                        to enforce it? One or the other he must plead guilty to, and either stamps
                        him as utterly unfitted to have a command of any kind. The sooner he is
                        dismissed the service the sooner will the honor and dignity of the
                        profession be vindicated.</p>
                    <p>Maj. Morrow has a right to be a Democrat and a Woodward or a McClellan man,
                        or anything else he pleases; and he has a right to attend Union or
                        Democratic meetings when such attendance does not conflict with his military
                        duties; but we insist that he has no right to get drunk and let his men
                        loose and get drunk with him, solely for the purpose of interfering with a
                        political meeting of any kind. That he should be a violent copperhead when
                        drunk, is most natural, for a drunken officer is the most brutal and
                        degraded of all men, and if there be a latent spark of the traitor in him,
                        it will crop out as surely as the sparks fly upward. We kindly advise the
                        Major to leave the service at the earliest possible period. He can resign by
                        stating the truth--that his "character as a soldier and a gentleman" is
                        impaired by occasional intoxication and fits of hostility to Union men, and
                        he will doubtless be taken at his word. Once free, he could redeem something
                        of his manhood by going openly into the rebel ranks, or he may play the part
                        of a cowardly copperhead at home, as the latter seems to be "constitutional"
                        according to modern Democratic construction. One thing, however, he cannot
                        and shall not do--that is interrupt Union meetings and the sooner he learns
                        this lesson the better!</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The loyal women in every community have exerted a vast influence in
                        sustaining the war and the government. Let them remember that in no way can
                        they better uphold their country at this hour than by influencing votes
                            for Curtin and against Woodward. They can influence fathers, husbands and sons. To
                        the young women we would say, that if after trying all their persuasive
                        eloquence on their suitors they prove to be
                        incorrigible Copperheads, give them the mitten at
                        once. Don't waste a smile on a fellow who refuses either by bullet or ballot
                        to help put down the rebellion. Make these bucks face the Union music
                        square, or go under! The sick and wounded soldiers everywhere bless our
                        noble women. They will bestow upon them additional blessings if they aid in
                        electing the soldiers' truest friend, Andrew G. Curtin.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The New York Tribune, of Saturday, shows us in a
                        brief article, how good a work the President has done for the army and the
                        nation, by his timely interposition between the Copperheads and their
                        cherished object, of defeating the draft and so preventing the reinforcement
                        of the army, when he issued his recent proclamation suspending the
                        privileges of the writ of habeas corpus in
                        certain cases. The Tribune's article, showing how
                        the schemes of the conspirators of copperheadism have been brought to
                        naught, is as follows:</p>
                    <p>The President's proclamation suspending the writ of habeas corpus has created
                        a sensation throughout the entire country. Conscripts who indulged the hope
                        that disloyal Judges would provide a way of escape for them have determined
                        to pay the commutation fee, furnish substitutes, or respond in person to the
                        summons of the Provost Marshal. Deserters who have been playing the
                        hide-and-seek, or staying away from the army under the cover of forged
                        furloughs, realize the fact that the Government is in earnest, and are
                        hastening back to their camps. Every train of cars that comes to the city,
                        and every steamer that stops at our wharves brings men who have out stayed
                        their furloughs or who have left the army without permission. Stalwart and
                        symmetrical men from different parts of the country are coming here
                        constantly to offer themselves as substitute for drafted men who can obtain
                        for them the fee of three hundred dollars. In the mean time, volunteer
                        enlistments continue to add brave fellows to our troops. Thus the work goes
                        on. Several thousand conscripts and substitutes from different parts of the
                        State have been sent from Riker's Island to the army, and from New Dorp a
                        large force of volunteers have gone in the same direction. Just before the
                        issuing of the proclamation, some of the courts commenced the work of
                        liberating the conscripts. In Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, Albany, New York
                        and elsewhere, the arrangements had been made to embarrass the Government by
                        withholding men from the army; but the suspension of the writ has spoiled
                        all their plans. Since the commencement of the rebellion, one disloyal man,
                        by the use of the power given him in the writ of habeas corpus, has taken
                        from the ranks of our volunteers a large number of men. A few such
                        Copperheads scattered over the States could in a few weeks undo the work
                        accomplished by the draft, and secure--what they so devoutly desire--the
                        delay coveted by the Confederates.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>There are now from ten to twelve hundred soldiers in Franklin county, who
                        have served the cause of their country with credit and been honorably
                        discharged. They have braved disease and the perils of battle in their
                        devotion to the Flag of the Republic, and many bear honorable wounds to
                        attest their heroism against the mendacious hosts of treason, while others
                        of their comrades sleep in untimely graves as martyrs to the preservation of
                        our liberties and the peace of our homes. Eight companies of the gallant
                        126th, which won for itself imperishable fame alike at Fredericksburg and
                        Chancellorsville, have returned to us, save the lamented dead, whose
                        memories are cherished in unfading gratitude in every loyal heart; and five
                        companies of the 158th, after a term of arduous and often perilous service,
                        are also at their homes to discharge their duties as citizens.</p>
                    <p>On the 13th of October next, these brave defenders of our common Nationality
                        will be called upon to cast their votes for the first office in the gift of
                        the people of Pennsylvania. They know, by actual and often sad experience,
                        how desperate, how deadly are the minions of treason in their purpose to
                        overthrow this government. They know how the brave soldiers in the field
                        turn with imploring hearts to the people at home for approval, for sympathy,
                        for earnest support. They know how it would chill the soul of the army; how
                        it would shadow its high hopes; how it would paralyze its strength; how it
                        would cast a wide-spread gloom over the defenders of the Flag, while it
                        would inspire the fading hopes and nerve the wasting strength of their rebel
                        foes, should the great Keystone State declare for peace by dishonorable
                        compromise with relentless treason. They cannot, therefore, be indifferent
                        spectators in this great, this vital struggle. With them indifference would
                        be a crime against the cause for which they periled their lives, and a crime
                        against the brave men who remain in the field to complete what they so nobly
                        began. They will vote, we doubt not, and they of all others, will want to
                        vote so as to give renewed life and hope to the Republic. They cannot vote
                        to bring dishonor upon the graves of their fallen comrades; to bring infamy
                        upon the wounds borne by their brave companions, and to bring disaster upon
                        the noble veterans they left behind them still rallying around the Flag and
                        confronting the foe. They cannot vote a ticket whose success would give joy
                        to every traitor in arms against the government, from the arch-fiend of
                        treason down to the humbles of his followers. They cannot vote, as
                        instructed by the Richmond Enquirer, which
                        appeals to Lee to "drive Meade into Washington and he
                            will again raise the spirits of the Democrats, confirm the timid, and
                            give confidence to the wavering." They cannot vote for a
                        candidate for Governor who has judicially proscribed every soldier in the
                        sacred cause of his country, and denied to him a voice in the selection of
                        his rulers, nor for a party that, in its platform, has not a word of hope
                        for the soldier that the right to vote shall be guaranteed him. For
                        soldiers, who have braved the bloody foes of the government in the field, to
                        vote for them at home would be to turn with suicidal hands upon their own
                        honor, and upon their country's cause.</p>
                    <p>The tickets presented by the two parties in Franklin county make the issue so
                        plain to soldiers that he who runs may read. On the Union ticket, the
                        candidate for the legislature is a faithful and honored Lieutenant who
                        served with untarnished credit. The candidate for Prothonotary rose from the
                        ranks in the three month's service to a commission, and was honorably
                        discharged at the end of his term of enlistment. The candidate for Register
                        and Recorder fell at Fredericksburg with his arm so shattered that
                        amputation was necessary. The candidate for Treasurer commanded the 126th at
                        Fredericksburg, and fell so severely wounded that he must be crippled for
                        life, and the candidate for Director of the Poor also fell in the same
                        sanguinary engagement, and has not yet recovered from his wounds. Thus is
                        almost every office of honor or profit conceded to the noble volunteers who
                        gave their lives the fortune of war to preserve our honored Nationality. on
                        the other hand, the Democratic ticket is without a
                            veteran soldier's name, save that of Captain McKesson, who was
                        dismissed from the service. Can the returned soldiers doubt which of the two
                        parties is in earnest sympathy with the brave men who voluntarily periled
                        everything that the Republic might live?</p>
                    <p>Of the two candidates for Governor, Judge Woodward is not the friend of the Government. He denounces every measure of the
                        administration to strengthen our armies in the field, to provide means for
                        their payment, and to weaken our deadly foe; and his voice has yet to be
                        raised to give hope and strength to the gallant sons of the North, who have
                        won for themselves, for their Flag, and for their country the most brilliant
                        achievements in the history of warfare. Gov. Curtin, the Union candidate,
                        has devoted his whole energies to the cause of the government and its
                        defenders. He has answered every demand made upon the State, and when his
                        brave Pennsylvanians were once in the field his cares have just begun. In
                        health he has multiplied their comforts; in sickness he has solaced and
                        ministered to them, and in death he has made their cause his cause--their
                        interests his interests--their success his success--and there is scarcely a
                        soldier whose heart does not leap with emotion and whose eye does not
                        quicken with gratitude, at the mention of the honored name of Andrew G.
                        Curtin.</p>
                    <p>Soldiers of Franklin county! Your cause and your country's cause, are upon
                        trial before the People. Shall your compatriots on the county ticket, and
                        your patriotic and devoted Executive, receive your approval or your
                        condemnation at the polls? Will you bring honor or dishonor upon the
                        veterans of the Republic and its sacred Flag? Will you give joy to the loyal
                        hearts at home and the heroes of loyalty in the field? or will you give
                        fresh heart and hope to now despairing treason?</p>
                    <p>Soldiers, and soldiers' friends, answer at the polls!</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We give in to day's paper, in German type, the platform of Judge Woodward, as
                        to the rights of foreigners, and commend it to every German in our county.
                        It is a correct statement from the official records, and can be implicitly
                        relied upon as representing correctly the position taken by Judge Woodward.
                        He boldly declared that no foreigner should be allowed to vote or hold
                        office in Pennsylvania after 1841, and gave as a reason for his motion, that
                        they were unfitted to enjoy the privileges of citizenship. If in the face of
                        this declaration, Germans can vote for Judge Woodward, they must show a poor
                        appreciation indeed of the priceless blessings they enjoy. Let no German in
                        Franklin county deposit his ballot without first seeing Judge Woodward's
                        record. Look to it Union men, that they are faithfully advised of it. We
                        have the official debates for the inspection of any one who disputes the
                        correctness of our report.</p>
                    <p>There are hundreds of German voters in Franklin county. Will they vote for a
                        man who declares that they are unfitted to hold office or enjoy the right of
                        suffrage? Will they vote for a man who, when revising the Constitution of
                        our State, demanded that it should positively deny to them forever the
                        rights of citizenship?</p>

                    including the rumor of another raid into Pennsylvania by Lee during election

                    the same platform of Copperhead disloyalty, that Gov. Curtin made great
                    contributions to the war effort, and that the election of Woodward would comfort
                    rebels and their Northern sympathizers.<br>
