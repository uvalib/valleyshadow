                    <p>Executive Mansion, Washington, D.C., July 30, 1863--It is the duty of every
                        Government to give protection to its citizens, of whatever class, color or
                        condition, and especially to those who are duly organized as soldiers in the
                        public service. The law of nations, and the usages and customs of war, as

                        treatment of prisoners of war as public enemies. To sell or enslave any

                        of war, is a relapse into barbarism, and a crime against the civilization of
                        the age.</p>
                    <p>The Government of the United States will give the same protection to all its
                        soldiers, and if the enemy shall sell or enslave any one because of his
                        color, the offense shall be punished by retaliation upon the enemy's
                        prisoners in our possession. It is therefore ordered, that for every soldier
                        of the United States killed in violation of the law, a Rebel soldier shall
                        be executed, and for every one enslaved by the enemy or sold into slavery, a
                        Rebel soldier shall be placed at hard labor on the public works, and
                        continued at such labor until the other shall be released and receive the

                        men from this county, reached Harrisburg last week, in care of Rev. Daniel
                        Hartman. The regiment, if not there by this time, will be there in a very
                        few days and the men will be mustered out, and discharged. It is conceded on
                        all hands that our drafted men from Pennsylvania made excellent soldiers,
                        and none surpassed Col. McKibbin's command in all the qualities which make
                        valuable and reliable men in the service. We doubt not that many of them
                        will volunteer after they have been home a little time, and again enter the
                        service during the war. Being experienced men, they will be entitled to the
                        liberal bounty of over $400 should they enlist.</p>
