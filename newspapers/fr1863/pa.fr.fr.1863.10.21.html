<b>Election Night</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Recounts the events in the Repository office on election night.<br>(Names in announcement:   Brewer,  C. M. Duncan,   Orr,   Kirby,   Stenger,   Kennedy,   Douglas,   Kimmell,   McLellan,   Eyster, Esq. John Stewart)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Election night comes but once a year, and always in the midst of the
                        "melancholy day," to some more particularly in fact rather than in song,
                        "the saddest of the year." It comes with Dame Nature in her richest
                        variegated robes, as if to teach to mortals that in this mundane sphere, and
                        especially in elections, there is a glorious uncertainty that often upsets
                        the neatest figures and knocks to smithereens, "Those high built hopes that
                        crush us by their fall." But it has its compensations, as generous. Nature
                        seems never to be without them. With the fading leaves of the forest and the
                        fading majorities of sanguine candidates, some golden fruits of corn fields
                        and orchards, and chestnut boys and apple dames are ever crossing your path
                        with ceaseless efforts to soothe [sic] the bitterest disappointments. How
                        the bewitching--"have a quart sir--only ten cents sir?" breaks upon the
                        swelling surges of political grief, and the amiable flame's "two for a
                        penny, sir--soft and sweet," comes like the evening's sun rays upon the
                        tempest-hidden heavens.</p>
                    <p>So election day came on the memorable 13th of October, 1863. In strict
                        accordance with the almanac, the sun rose in the east as usual, and
                        majestically coursed his way westward, as if ignorant of the earnest strife
                        below him, and set with becoming splendor at the appointed time by the Town
                        clock. The day was big with destiny. So newspapers had told us in words of
                        bewildering pathos, and orators of every grade had harangued the "toiling
                        millions" from street corners, store boxes, beer barrels, town pumps and
                        balconies--each one insisting that the defeat of his particular candidate
                        would frighten the stars and comets from their courses, jar the world from
                        its axis, make the war last a little beyond forever; make the National debt
                        so large that a new arithmetic would have to be invented to calculate it;
                        make the taxes so immense that all the property of the country would be
                        taken each year in part payments, posterity to be mortgaged for the balance,
                        and last but not least, that sundry fence rails, and horses and forage
                        stolen or taken by the military would be unpaid until considerably after the
                        crack of doom. Such at least were a Reporter's impressions after listening
                        to the senior of the Repository and scores of others as they saved the
                        government by "much speaking," night after night on the Curtin side, and our
                        convictions were only deepened, intensified and confounded as we heard the
                        poetic Brewer, the historic Duncan, the festive Orr and their coadjutors in
                        behalf of Woodward. We heard all in patience as our Reportial duties
                        imperatively demanded, and on the great day we sat in sorrowing silence as
                        we contemplated what must be the issue when so much truth and error come in
                        actual conflict. We thought of starless nights; of sunless days; of
                        wandering orbs playing fantastic tricks, of comet's tails sweeping we knew
                        not where and crushing we knew not what; and in despair we awaited the
                        coming chaos.</p>
                    <p>But the day came just as other days--the sun shone with accustomed
                        brilliancy--the few remaining birds were merry as before--men walked on
                        their feet, talked with their tongues, "smiled" with their lips, and voted
                        as they liked just as in times gone by, and we took heart ere the day wore
                        into gentle evening, and hoped that another sun might still rise and that a
                        few more days might be vouchsafed to our imperiled Country. The valiant
                        leaders on both sides contested the ground with matchless
                        energy--encouraging the timid, inspiring the doubtful, stealing the
                        oblivious and voting all for the "the ticket, the whole ticket, and nothing
                        but the ticket." As the evening hours grew upon the belligerent hosts, their
                        steps quickened, their "smiles" thickened, and their words grew in
                        earnestness as dying time taught brevity. At last the magic hour of seven
                        was solemnly tolled by the old clock--down went the windows, and the
                        battling armies withdrew to await the reports of killed and wounded.</p>
                    <p>It was then that the Report[or]ial duties thickened. The streets resounded
                        with bewildering yells for favorite candidates, and abortive bets and
                        bloodless fights were to be met with at every corner. We called for a secure
                        base of operations and reinforcements. A council of war was convened in the
                        fourth story of the Repository office, consisting of the proprietors,
                        foreman, and the satanic corps. It was resolved to make the Editorial room
                        the base of all operation, and to keep it open as long as dispatches could
                        be had by telegraph, without regard to the character of the news. The junior
                        imp insisted upon distracting the council with hurra[h]s for Gen. Geo. B.
                        McCurtin, but the foreman finally gagged him with a copy of the Spirit and Times and thus preserved order. The
                        devils were deployed as skirmishers under immediate command of the foreman,
                        and to insure system and safety to all, the following general order was
                        issued:</p>
                    <p>Head Quarters Repository Office <br>Chambersburg, Oct. 13th, 1863.</p>
                    <p>General Order No. 1,254,349.</p>
                    <p>1. The Satanic Corps of this Department will be in readiness for duty at 7.25
                        P.M. to-day with twelve hours rations and drinks.</p>
                    <p>2. They will preserve the utmost decorum under all circumstances. No pitching
                        of chestnuts, or pinning of pocket handkerchiefs or printed devices on
                        dignitaries will be allowed.</p>
                    <p>3. Water shall invariably be mixed with their beverages, and not more than
                        twelve strong drinks per hour will be allowed when upon duty.</p>
                    <p>4. No flags of truce will be allowed before strangers. To avoid accidents of
                        this kind, the whole corps will wear long coats until relieved.</p>
                    <p>5. To prevent demoralization in this corps no betting on the election will be
                        allowed--unless the corps is sure to win, and all winnings shall belong to
                        the foreman.</p>
                    <p>6. If entrusted with despatches for these headquarters containing favorable
                        news, they will thank the messenger and return with all possible haste.</p>
                    <p>7. If unfavorable news be given them on the outposts, they will knock the
                        bearer down and suppress the news on the obvious ground of military
                        necessity.</p>
                    <p>8. The corps is positively forbidden to ask defeated candidates "what thunder
                        that was" or "whether the lightning struck anybody else," particularly if
                        such candidates belong to our side.</p>
                    <p>9. Satanic Corps! The eyes of the world are upon you. The Repository expects
                        every man to do his duty.</p>
                    <p>Kirby, Foreman.</p>
                    <p>The order was read at the head of each squad, and the devils grinned out from
                        their inky faces their enthusiastic approbation. They were immediately
                        deployed upon duty, and soon the junior imp rushed in, shouting--"North Ward
                        282 for Curtin--bully for Old Andy--the Cop--." The foreman arrested the
                        imp's enthusiasm at this point, and read article 8th of General Orders No.
                        1,254,349 to the offender some fifty-seven time, so as to impress him
                        properly and avoid the necessity of punishment hereafter. He manifested his
                        appreciation of the foreman's solemnity by slipping peanut shells into the
                        foreman's boots, while he read the order. In a few minutes another of the
                        corps came in with a somersault and yelled "South Ward--18 for--for--for--I'll go back and inquire who!" The
                        foreman's boot-toe struck the door jam about one-eighth of an inch behind a
                        receding body, as a satanic streak vanished down stairs, and the entire
                        articles of the general order were again read to the members of the corps
                        not on duty some eleven times to guard against future accidents. South Ward
                        was now announced a 18 for Curtin, and the inky faces of the satanic corps
                        were wreathed with smiles, the Union men were jubilant. McLellan sat at one
                        end of the table and thought that "the indications" were favorable--the
                        majority in the county would probably be a million or a million and a half.
                        Eyster thought that the majority would not be quite so large, and several
                        hundred thousand dollars were immediately bet upon the result. The senior of
                        the Repository sat in front of the table with telegraphic dispatches flying
                        around him like snow-flakes on an angry fall day. Having been made
                        stake-holder for several bets he went in freely himself and lost on
                        Hamilton, on Allegheny, &amp;c. We learn that he has adjusted matters
                        and secured an extension. The junior having bet seven dollars and a half on
                        the general result, shut himself up in the counting room and listened
                        through the key-hole until Curtin's election was settled, when he stepped
                        into the headquarters with an air of majestic indifference and said he "knew
                        it would go all right." One of the satanic corps in the corner whispered
                        "key-hole fortitude," but the foreman flung the sheeps-foot at him and
                        proceeded to read the order again several times.</p>
                    <p>One of the most trusty of the corps was now detailed with a squad to hang
                        crape upon the doors of the Democratic headquarters. Their lights were
                        out--their garlands dead, and their banquet halls were deserted. Orr's
                        office was found bolted, craped and the key-hole stopped up with an election
                        calculation from the Spirit office, giving the
                        Democratic ticket 300 majority in the county. He had turned philosopher and
                        subsided early. The detail next went to Brewer's, but found obstructions
                        near the door in the shape of a pile of wood. After various strategic
                        movements the gallant squad flanked the wood pile and reached the door. The
                        leader just then bethought him that the obstructions might be a pile of
                        greenbacks thrown out to trade for wood, cord for cord, and forthwith he
                        plunged his Barlow-Damascus blade into the innocent oak, and left a wiser
                        and sadder devil. It was wood! Duncans, Stengers, the Spirit, &amp;c., were duly draped and the detail returned.
                        By this time the headquarters were filled up with both parties. Duncan,
                        Kennedy, Douglas, Stenger, Kimmell and other defeated heroes, recovered
                        their breath and mingled with the Union crowd and laughed disaster in the
                        face. Kimmell dilated on the rural districts and the "frosty sons of
                        thunder" in Somerset and yelled "served him right" as a dispatch was read
                        announcing that Vallandigham had run only a few scattering votes in Ohio.
                        Just then a suppressed voice was heard from the satanic corps in the
                        corner--"Why is Judge Kimmell like a pile of brick?" "Give it up!" "Cause he
                        may be turned himself but he can't turn a Somerset!" The foreman immediately split the fire-board over the
                        imp's head, and he vaulted out of the room congratulating himself that
                        kindling would be plenty in the morning. Dispatches from the leading towns
                        of the State now flooded in, all announcing Curtin gains, and the crowd
                        mingled merrily and fought the battle over loquaciously. Duncan waited until
                        Allegheny was reported at from 8,000 to 10,000 and still rising; Lancaster
                        at 6,000; Philadelphia at 7,000 and Dauphin at 1,500, when he determined to
                        retire the Democratic army by proclamation. He therefore issued the
                        following, which was read eleven times from the steps of the Spirit office and printed in letters of salt on the
                        board fences for the cows to lick at:</p>
                    <p>Democratic Head-Quarters, <br>Chambersburg, Oct. 13--11 P.M.</p>
                    <p>Democrats! We've met the Abolition, Black Republican, Wooly-head, Nigger-war,
                        Greenback, National-debt, Oppressive-tax, anti-fence-paying Party, and we
                        are their'n! The causes of the great disaster are as numerous as the stars
                        of the heaven or the sands of the sea: but I attribute it mainly to want of votes! Had we polled more votes than the
                        other side, and the other side polled less than we did, I feel safe in
                        saying that we would have routed them horse, foot and dragoon--but we didn't
                        and "that's what's the matter!"</p>
                    <p>Our reinforcements from our Southern friends, as promised us by the Richmond
                            Enquirer, having failed to reach our lines in
                        time, I can only say in this hour of gloom, that all is lost save--our Country. Of our glorious Democratic party, I am
                        bound to declare that--</p>
                    <p>"Sickness sits cavern'd in its hollow eye!"</p>
                    <p>And--</p>
                    <p>Is is [sic] not better to die willingly</p>
                    <p>Than to linger till the glass be all outrun?"</p>
                    <p>I therefore pronounce the Democratic party dead, dead, dead! "After life's fitful fever it sleeps well."</p>
                    <p>Duncan.</p>
                    <p>The funeral solemnities being over, all parties resumed their wonted good
                        humor, and the chiefs of the Repository and of the Spirit, and the stumpers of both sides sat around the same table
                        and had merry jokes over the battle just closed. The genial temper of the
                        circle was here broken by a gutteral [sic] sound from the corner--"Democrats
                        vote early and see that your neighbors vote!" It was one of the imps reading
                        the last issue of the Spirit. The foreman and the
                        Editor of the Spirit examined the general
                        order--the Editor insisting that it was a violation of all decorum to read
                        his own paper to him under the circumstances, and the foreman so construed
                        the order: whereupon the offending imp was reduced to but one quart of
                        ches[t]nuts and two quarts of lager for the balance of the night. Just then
                        Letterkenny came in with a whirlwind of Democracy--"84 for Woodward," was
                        the cry. Smiling faces blanched and there was a calm as various pencils made
                        hasty figures on election tables. A medium sized, mild-mannered gentleman
                        then entered, and the satanic corps were about to greet him with a volley of
                        pea-nuts as the bearer of Letterkenny, when the foreman gasped "Gen. Couch,"
                        and palsied the impy arms. In a suppressed tone they gravely discussed the
                        problem--how so amiable gentleman could make killing his trade, and finally
                        made various strategic efforts to ascertain whether he was for Curtin or
                        Woodward. They watched to see whether he laughed on the Greenvillage or
                        Letterkenny side of his mouth; but he defied their ingenuity by his genial
                        humor under all reports. Finally one of the impatient imps yelled out--"Why
                        is Gen. Couch like the Editor of the Spirit?"
                        "'Cause he don't hurrah at elections!" The foreman again enforced decorum by
                        reading his order some fifteen or twenty times, and the General, after a
                        pleasant chat with both sides, made a "masterly retreat." The corps gave him
                        three cheers as he left, and the junior devil took advantage of the
                        confusion to ask--"Why is Duncan, Chairman of the Democratic Committee, like
                        Poe's raven?" A painful silence followed so doleful an inquiry, when the
                        little imp in sepulchral tones answered--"Never
                        more! The foreman hurled the shooting-stick and mallet at the
                        refractory little satan, but he dodged them all and with ghastly grin
                        disappeared.</p>
                    <p>The storm "wee sma' hours" had now stolen in upon the scene, and the election
                        had ceased to be of interest. The county was for Curtin--the whole Union
                        county ticket was elected--the State had gone for Curtin; and when the head
                        was off the Democracy it mattered little how many arms or legs were saved by
                        local majorities. One by one the crowd fell off and the head-quarters were
                        about to be closed for the night, when the junior imp rushed in with a copy
                        of an important correspondence between the Chairmen of the County
                        Committees. He insisted that it was genuine--that he had seen it fall out of
                        the hats of the Chairmen with several "bricks," and he vouched for its
                        genuineness. Assured that under the strict orders of the foreman the little
                        satanic would not commit forgery, we accept the correspondence as correct
                        and give it herewith to our readers:</p>

                    <p>Sir: I am credibly informed that you are at the head of a most valuable
                        troupe of vaulters and blowers, who are singularly skillful in reducing
                        Democratic majorities.</p>
                    <p>I desire at this early period to secure the services of your self and troupe
                        for the next season to speak for the Democratic party at stated periods, and
                        thus promote the success of the Union ticket.</p>
                    <p>Please inform me what you will take for the first thirty nights.</p>
                    <p>Very Respectfully</p>
                    <p><br>Your obedient servant, John Stewart. <br>Chairman Union Co. Committee.
                        <br>To C.M. Duncan, Esq., Chairman Dem. Co. Com.</p>

                    <p>Democratic County Committee Rooms,</p>
                    <p><br>Chambersburg, Oct. 13--11:58 P.M.</p>
                    <p>Sir: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your favor proposing to
                        employ myself and troupe for the next political season, and asking what we
                        "will take for the first thirty nights."</p>
                    <p>In answer I would say that we "will take" brandy and water moderately mixed.
                        We regard water as very good for purposes of navigation, but object to it as
                        a steady beverage.</p>
                    <p>Very respectfully</p>
                    <p><br>Your obedient servant, C.M. Duncan, <br>Chairman Democratic County Com.</p>
                    <p>To John Stewart, Esq., Chairman Union Co. Com.</p>
                    <p>The negociations [sic] were progressing favorably at last accounts, and it is
                        hoped that the contract will be consum[m]ated.</p>
                    <p>Order and quiet now resumed their sway in the venerable village of
                        Chambersburg, and the Reporter's rest came as the lights faded out, and the
                        angry tide of political strife gave way in obedience to the demands of
                        exhausted nature. Honor to the heroism and pardon to the follies of the late
                        campaign. It has ended well, and is now history. Long live the Republic!</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Last year Franklin county was about a tie, and part of each ticket was
                        elected. Since then the Union cause has had almost every possible
                        embarrassment. The loss of property by rebel raids--the wanton destruction
                        of property by our own military--the frauds often practiced upon the people
                        by persons assuming to act in various military capacities, and the failure
                        of the government to remunerate them, cost us hundreds of votes. In addition
                        to this we were in the midst of a draft that is benefit[t]ing the government
                        but little and annoying and oppressing the people very much; and there is
                        not a voter in the county effected by any of these causes who was not
                        visited and appealed to by Copperheads to vote against the government,
                        because it was faithless to its own people.</p>
                    <p>In the face of all these embarrassments the Union men went into the contest;
                        and but for the untiring and systematic labor performed, the county would
                        have been lost. John Stewart, Esq., the Chairman of the Union County
                        Committee, rendered most important service to the cause. He discharged his
                        responsible duties with matchless fidelity and consummate skill, and has
                        justly earned his rank as an admirable popular leader. He was nobly
                        sustained not only by the leading friends of the Union cause in the
                        differing districts, but on the stump, in council and in every way, by
                        Eyster, Clark, Everett, Stumbaugh, Bonebrake, M'Lellan, Nill, Seilhamer and
                        others who gave their best energies to the good work.</p>
                    <p>In addition to thees [sic], Mr. Jay, of New Jersey, and Hon. F. Bound, of
                        Northumberland, contributed much to our success by their pointed and
                        eloquent speeches in different parts of the county. Each of them spent a
                        week in the county, speaking every night, and their efforts were most
                        acceptable and effective. They will be gratefully remembered by the Union
                        men of the "Green Spot."</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Late on Tuesday night, after the election returns had been counted in
                        Hamilton, Mr. Michael Coble and Henry Riley, two officers of the election,
                        accompanied by Richard Ridgley and John Row, were going home, and when a
                        little beyond the western gate-house met some soldiers. A slight altercation
                        ensued, in which Mr. Coble took no part however, and stones were thrown by
                        both sides. Mr. Coble had not stopped, but gone on ahead of his companions.
                        After parleying some time with the soldiers, they followed on up the hill,
                        and the soldiers fired several shots, two of which took effect in Mr. Coble,
                        one in the head, and killing him almost instantly. Subsequently a squad of
                        soldiers were sent out to arrest those who had fired the shots, and one
                        soldier attempted to escape by running away, when the squad fired and
                        wounded one of their own squad seriously but not fatally. It is not yet
                        known who killed Mr. Coble, and no arrests have yet been made. Mr. Coble was
                        a most estimable citizen.</p>
                    <p>We but reflect the convictions of the people generally in this section when
                        we say that our soldiers are often wanting in that discipline that is
                        essential to their own and the public safety. True, they are raw troops as a
                        rule; but their officers cannot too soon learn the necessity of requiring
                        them to use their arms against the public enemy and not against unarmed
                        citizens.</p>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The administration has wisely determined to call three hundred thousand
                        additional troops into the field; and requisitions have been, or soon will
                        be, made upon the several States for their respective quotas. Every effort
                        will be made by a direct appeal to the people to furnish these men as
                        volunteers, and to that end generous bounties will be paid to experienced
                        soldiers, and even raw recruits will receive a liberal reward for entering
                        the service. This step of the government is eminently proper. Two weeks or
                        two months ago it could not have been done with any hope of success. The
                        people were involved in bitter political struggles in the leading States,
                        and the judgment of the Nation was questioned as to the policy of the
                        administration. Now, however, the people have demanded by decisive verdict,
                        that the government shall prosecute the war until Treason ceases to array
                        itself in hostile ranks against the Republic; and we doubt not that the
                        patriotic of all parties will so accept it and bow to their decision. The
                        Democratic party, when separated from a few unworthy leaders in each
                        locality, who have brought mingled disaster and dishonor upon it, is loyal
                        to the core; and now that the purpose of the people is clearly defined, they
                        will without regard to party lines, rally around the Old Flag and make
                        common cause to hasten Peace by the destruction of the insurgent armies.</p>
                    <p>Rosecrans has been driven from the Chickamauga back upon Chattanooga, and
                        compelled to assume the defensive, solely because he was overwhelmed by
                        numbers. Had he fifty thousand additional men to-day he could at once resume
                        the offensive and close his already brilliant campaign by holding the very
                        heart of the rebel dominions; destroying vast sources of supplies, and
                        crippling them most vitally. Had Meade fifty thousand fresh troops he would
                        not be retiring before Lee and avoiding proffered battle, lest a disaster
                        should make our National Capitol the trophy of traitors; nor would the
                        people of the border counties be trembling under a sense of insecurity to
                        their homes and property. On the contrary, Gen. Meade if strong as he should
                        be, would speedily transfer the war to the Cotton States; restore Richmond
                        and all of Virginia to to [sic] loyal rule, and establish permanent peace
                        and safety on the border. If Grant had fifty thousand additional troops he
                        would capture Mobile in thirty days, acting in concert with Rosecrans, and
                        in the same time would settle the threatening question of French foothold in
                        Mexico and Texas by re-possessing the entire territory of Texas. If Gen.
                        Gilmore had twenty-five thousand men he would capture Charleston and
                        Savannah in twenty days, and Foster with a like number of re-inforcements
                        would open the only remaining port of Wilmington to the trade of the world,
                        and have his head-quarters in the capital of North Carolina before the
                        holidays.</p>
                    <p>These are the fruits which must result from the prompt and ample
                        strengthening of our armies, and they would be the
                            immediate harbingers of Peace. With such achievements the
                        rebellion would cease to have either government or armies--either head, or
                        heart, or life; and another six months would bring us practically to the end
                        of the war. If we throw three hundred thousand new troops into the field
                        now, the rebels could not fight a single pitched battle. They would be
                        unequal to our gallant armies at every point, and the most decisive results
                        would be attained with but little loss of life.</p>
                    <p>Let it be borne in mind that the addition of three hundred thousand men to
                        our brave brethren now in the field, is the true principle of economy. It
                        will save thousands of lives, millions of
                        dollars, insure early and honorable Peace, and give to us, to our children
                        and to the world the American Republic in strengthened bonds of Union. Let
                        loyal men sink political differences--let them join hearts and hands to
                        hasten the ultimate triumph of our common Flag, by swelling the ranks of the
                        army, and we can then rejoice as members of a common brotherhood over the
                        preservation of our common Nationality.</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports Union successes in elections in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and
                    Iowa.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana and Iowa have spoken, in tones not to be
                        misunderstood, declaring that the Republic shall live! The joyful tidings
                        have flashed from the coast of Maine to the slopes of the Pacific; from the
                        North-western wilderness to the mouth of the Father of Waters; from the
                        swelling hearts of a loyal people at home to the threatened veterans of
                        Rosecrans and Meade, and there is rejoicing and gratitude wherever unmingled
                        loyalty has a home, that the great States of the North have resolved to
                        strengthen the hands of the government; to cheer the brave defenders of its
                        Flag, and to preserve unimpaired and unspotted our sacred Nationality.</p>
                    <p>There is Pennsylvania--behold her! After a contest waged against her
                        patriotism and fidelity by subtle, insidious, sleepless foes--after a season
                        of bewildering defamation and unscrupulous appeals to every passion or
                        prejudice that warred upon the Country--after denouncing everything but
                        treason to the ignorant, and promising everything to the patriot--the people
                        have vindicated their undying devotion to the Institutions of their Fathers,
                        and hurled back in hapless despair those who sought power to paralyze the
                        government in its deadly struggle with treason. The Keystone State has
                        spoken in behalf of her martyred dead--has declared that theirs shall be
                        sepulchres of honor, not of shame--has defended her living from that sordid
                        cowardice that would barter a Republic for the shadow of Peace, with anarchy
                        and degradation as its fruits.</p>
                    <p>Ohio has joined with Pennsylvania in spurning treason of every shade; and
                        Vallandigham, in the retreat that his hate for his government and people has
                        assigned him, has heard with crushing mortification the verdict: The
                        Republic must live--Treason shall die! Indiana has mingled her voice with
                        ours, and announced her purpose to support the friends; to dethrone the foes
                        of the government: and little Iowa, away on the sunset side of the
                        Mississippi, answers across in thunder tones, her determination to preserve
                        the Union without cowardly compromise or humiliating concession to give life
                        and hope to future traitors.</p>
                    <p>Especially do we rejoice that Pennsylvania has a faithful Executive. Andrew
                        G. Curtin has served his great State and his Country's cause with a devotion
                        and singleness of purpose in which none but himself has been his parallel.
                        His herculean labors and ceaseless care for the brave sons of Pennsylvania,
                        have stricken him with untimely frosts--have dimmed his eye, and borne him
                        down life's rapid stream with quickened pace; but his heart beats with all
                        the ardor of youth in behalf of his imperiled Nationality and People, and
                        while treason lives to hate and to crimson the steps of Freedom, the power
                        of his mighty State will be ever wielded as its deadly foe. All honor to
                        Gov. Curtin--all hail faithful, loyal Pennsylvania! The Republic lives!</p>
