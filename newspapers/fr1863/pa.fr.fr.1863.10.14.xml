                <transcript>
                    <p>We have before us the official report of Gen. Lee, giving the detailed
                        account of his disastrous campaign in Pennsylvania. The readers of the
                        Repository have already had in these columns everything pertaining to that
                        movement from loyal sources, that could be interesting or instructive, but
                        the account given by the rebel Commander-in-Chief throws new light upon the
                        purposes, plans and events of that campaign, which are necessary to a
                        perfect understanding of the grand combinations conceived and the terrible
                        disaster realized by the foes of the Republic.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Lee left his position on the Rappahannock because the lines of Hooker
                        were such as "could not be attacked to advantage," and he therefore
                        determined to draw Hooker from his defences. He adds--"The execution of this
                        purpose embraced the relief of the Shenandoah Valley from the troops that
                        had occupied the lower part of it during the winter and spring, and, if
                        practicable, the transfer of the scene of hostilities north of the Potomac."
                        He hoped that the movement of Hooker in pursuit of the rebels might afford
                        an opportunity to "strike a blow" at the Union army; that Hooker would
                        certainly be "compelled to leave Virginia, and possibly draw to his support
                        troops designed to operate against other parts of the country." He adds--"In
                        this way it was supposed that the enemy's plan of campaign for the summer
                        would be broken up, and part of the season of active operations be consumed
                        in the formation of new combinations and the preparations that they would
                        require." These considerations, strengthened by the hope "that other
                        valuable results might be attended by military success," give us the purpose
                        of Lee in his aggressive movement.</p>
                    <p>He recites the movements of the different corps of his army with minuteness.
                        The forward movement began on the 3d of June, just one month before the
                        terrible repulse he met with at Gettysburg. On that day McLaw's division
                        left Fredericksburg for Culpepper, and Hood's division started from the
                        Rapidan for the same point at the same time. They were followed on the 4th
                        and 5th, where they were joined by Gen. Stuart with his cavalry. Gen.
                        Jenkins was then thrown forward toward Winchester, and Imboden was directed
                        to move toward Romney, to cover the movement against Winchester and prevent
                        reinforcements by the Baltimore and Ohio road. Gen. Rodes then advanced upon
                        Berryville to cut off Milroy's communication with the Potomac, and Gen.
                        Ewell with Early's and Johnson's divisions moved directly against
                        Winchester. The result of these movements are well known. On the 14th Gen.
                        Ewell carried Milroy's outer works, dispersed and captured most of his army,
                        guns and stores and entered Winchester, and on the same day Gen. Rodes
                        entered Martinsburg. These operations gave the rebels undispused [sic]
                        possession of the Shenandoah Valley, and Lee claims 4,000 prisoners, 29
                        guns, 70 wagons and ambulances and 400 horses as the trophies of his
                        victors.</p>
                    <p>On the night of the 14th, the same day Ewell entered Winchester, the Union
                        army left its position on the Rappahannock and commenced the pursuit. Then
                        the rebels had eleven days' start of Hooker, and held the entire Shenandoah,
                        with all the mountain gaps clean down to the Potomac, before he moved
                        against them. He then had no chance to offer battle South of the Potomac
                        except at great disadvantage, and he sensibly declined to do so. Lee says
                        that no "favorable opportunity was presented to attack" Hooker in his march,
                        as he kept the roads close to the Potomac, and "the transfer of the scene of
                        hostilities North of the Potomac" became a necessity for Lee, for he could
                        not remain idle with is whole army in the Shenandoah, so far from his base
                        of supplies. Gen. Jenkins was then ordered into Pennsylvania, and penetrated
                        as far as Chambersburg, but as this did not have the effect of drawing
                        Hooker from Virginia, and failed also in compelling him to attack Lee in his
                        chosen position, a movement in force into Maryland and Pennsylvania became
                        the only alternative remaining for Lee. On the 24th Longstreet and Hill
                        marched to the Potomac, and the former crossed at Williamsport and the
                        latter at Shepperdstown. These columns were united at Hagerstown and
                        advanced into Pennsylvania, reaching Chambersburg on the 27th. Lee thus
                        explains his position and plans after reaching this place:</p>
                    <p>"No report had been received that the Federal army had crossed the Potomac,
                        and the absence of the cavalry rendered it impossible to obtain accurate
                        information. In order, however, to retain it on the east side of the
                        mountains after it should enter Maryland, and thus leave open our
                        communication with the Potomac, through Hagerstown and Williamsport, Gen.
                        Ewell had been instructed to send a division eastward from Chambersburg to
                        cross the South Mountains. Early's division was detached for the purpose ,
                        and proceeded as far east as York while the remainder of the corps proceeded
                        to Carlisle.</p>
                    <p>"Gen. Imboden, in pursuance of instructions previously referred to, had been
                        actively engaged on the left of Gen. Ewell during the progress of the latter
                        into Maryland. He had driven off the forces guarding the Baltimore and Ohio
                        Railroad, destroyed all the important bridges on the route from Cumberland
                        to Martinsburg, and seriously damaged the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal.</p>
                    <p>"He subsequently took position at Hancock, and after the arrival of
                        Longstreet and Hill at Chambersburg was directed to march by way of
                        M'Connellsburg to that place."</p>
                    <p>There has been much conjecture as to the reasons which actuated the rebel
                        commander in failing to attack Harrisburg. It is well known that Gen.
                        Ewell's corps was all north of this place, and that he had an ample force to
                        assault the raw troops and rude fortifications improvised for the defense of
                        the capitol. It is clear now, however, that the exhausting efforts made by
                        Gen. Couch to save our capitol, with most inadequate means, resulted in so
                        delaying the rebel march that they were called to Gettysburg before they
                        felt entirely safe in making the attack. Gen. Lee says:</p>
                    <p>"Preparations were now made to advance upon Harrisburg, but on the night of
                        the 29th information was received from a scout that the Federal army, having
                        crossed the Potomac, was advancing northwards, and that the head of the
                        column had reached the South Mountain. As our communications with the
                        Potomac were thus menaced, it was resolved to prevent his further progress
                        in that direction by concentrating our army on the east side of the
                        mountains. Accordingly, Longstreet and Hill were directed to proceed from
                        Chambersburg to Gettysburg, to which point Gen. Ewell was also instructed to
                        march from Carlisle."</p>
                    <p>It will be seen that the capture of Harrisburg and the destruction of the
                        important bridges on the Susquehanna, were embraced in the rebel programme.
                        They were saved only by the militia and fortifications retarding Ewell's
                        movements until Meade threatened Lee's communications and required Lee to
                        recall Ewell and concentrate his army. Lee's army was now drawn together
                        with wonderful rapidity. Gen. Stuart crossed the Potomac at Seneca, and
                        marched by Westminster to Carlisle, where he found that Ewell had already
                        fallen back, and he hastened to join Lee at Gettysburg. Indeed Lee's whole
                        army was on the battle ground by the evening of the 2d of July, but
                        Imboden's command, which passed through Chambersburg on the evening of the
                        3d and joined Lee just in time to find him utterly defeated and retreating.
                        We give the account of the battle in Gen. Lee's own language:</p>
                    <p>"The march toward Gettysburg was conducted more slowly than it would have
                        been had the movements of the Federal army been known.</p>
                    <p>The leading division of Hill met the enemy in advance at Gettysburg, on the
                        morning of the 1st of July. Driving back the troops to within a short
                        distance of the town, he there encountered a large force with which two of
                        his divisions became entangled. Ewell coming up with two of his divisions on
                        the Heidlersburg road, joined in the engagement. The enemy was driven
                        through Gettysburg with much loss, including about five thousand prisoners
                        and several pieces of artillery.</p>
                    <p>We retreated to a high range of hills south and east of the town. The attack
                        was not pressed that afternoon, the enemy's force being unknown, and it
                        being considered advisable to await the arrival of the rest of our troops.
                        Orders were went back to hasten their march; and, in the meantime, every
                        effort was made to ascertain the numbers and position of the enemy, and find
                        the most favorable point of attack. It had not been intended to fight a
                        general battle at such a distance from our base, unless attacked by the
                        enemy: but, finding ourselves unexpectedly confronted by the Federal army,
                        it became a matter of difficulty to withdraw through the mountains with our
                        large trains. At the same time the country was unfavorable for collecting
                        supplies while the presence of the enemy's main body, as he was enabled to
                        restrain our foraging parties by occupying the passes of the mountains with
                        regular [illegible]. A battle thus became, in a measure, unavoidable.
                        Encouraged by the successful issue of the engagement on the first day, and
                        in view of the valuable results that would ensue from the defeat of the army
                        of Gen. Meade, it was thought advisable to renew the attack.</p>
                    <p>"The preparations for attack were not completed until the afternoon of the
                        2d.</p>
                    <p>"The enemy held a high and commanding ridge, along which he had massed a
                        large amount of artillery. Gen. Ewell occupied the left of our line, Gen.
                        Hill the centre, and Gen. Longstreet the right. In front of Gen. Longstreet
                        the enemy held a position, from which, if he could be driven, it was thought
                        that our army could be used to advantage in assailing the more elevated
                        ground beyond, and thus enable us to reach the crest of the ridge. That
                        officer was directed to endeavor to carry this position while Gen. Ewell
                        attacked directly the high ground on the enemy's right, which had already
                        been partially fortified. Gen. Hill was instructed to threaten the centre of
                        the Federal line, in order to prevent reinforcements being sent to either
                        wing, and to avail himself of any opportunity that might present itself to
                        attack.</p>
                    <p>"After a severe struggle Longstreet succeeded in getting possession of and
                        holding the desired ground. Ewell also carried some of the strong positions
                        which he assailed, and the result was such as to lead to the belief that he
                        would ultimately be able to dislodge the enemy. The battle ceased at dark.</p>
                    <p>"These partial successes determined me to continue the assault next day.
                        Pickett, with three of his brigades, joined Longstreet the following
                        morning, and our batteries were moved forward to the position gained by him
                        the day before.</p>
                    <p>"The general plan of attack was unchanged, except that one division and two
                        brigades of Hill's corps were ordered to support Longstreet.</p>
                    <p>"The enemy, in the meantime, had strengthened his line with earthworks. The
                        morning was occupied in necessary preparations, and the battle recommenced
                        in the afternoon of the 3d. and raged with great violence until sunset. Our
                        troops succeeded in entering the advanced works of the enemy, and getting
                        possession of some of his batteries; but our artillery having nearly
                        expended its ammunition, the attacking columns became exposed to the heavy
                        fire of the numerous batteries near the summit of the ridge, and, after a
                        most determined and gallant struggle, <emph rend="italic">were compelled to
                            relinquish their advantage, and fall back to their original position,
                            with severe loss.</emph>"</p>
                    <p>The report then compliments the conduct of his troops, and justly adds that
                        "they deserved success so far as it can be deserved by heroic valor and
                        fortitude." It cannot be doubted that the rebel army fought at Gettysburg
                        with a degree of courage worthy of the best cause; but they were met with
                        equal valor by the gallant Army of the Potomac, and finally had to abandon
                        their assaults in despair, with one-third of their men killed, wounded and
                        prisoners. Lee finding all his assaults to be fruitless save in their rich
                        harvest of death, resolved to retreat. He says:</p>
                    <p>"Owing to the strength of the enemy's position and the reduction of our
                        ammunition, a renewal of the engagement could not be hazarded, and the
                        difficulty of procuring supplies rendered it impossible to continue longer
                        where we were. Such of the wounded as were in condition to be removed, and
                        part of the arms collected on the field, were ordered to Williamsport. The
                        army remained at Gettysburg during the 4th and at night began to retire by
                        the road to Fairfield, carrying with it about 4,000 prisoners.</p>
                    <p>"Little progress was made that night, owing to a severe storm, which greatly
                        embarrassed our movements. The rear of the column did not leave its position
                        near Gettysburg until after daylight on the 5th.</p>
                    <p>"The march was continued during that day without interruption by the enemy,
                        except an unimportant demonstration upon our rear in the afternoon, when
                        near Fairfield, which was easily checked. Part of our trains moved by the
                        road through Fairfield, and the rest by the way of Cashtown, guarded by Gen.
                        Imboden. In passing through the mountains in advance of the column, the
                        great length of the trains exposed them to attack by the enemy's cavalry,
                        which captured a number of wagons and ambulances; but they succeeded in
                        reaching Williamsport without serious loss.</p>
                    <p>"The army, after an arduous march, rendered more difficult by the rains,
                        reached Hagerstown on the afternoon of the 6th and morning of the 7th of
                        July.</p>
                    <p>"The Potomac was found to be so much swollen by the rains that had fallen
                        almost incessantly since our entrance into Maryland as to be unfordable. Our
                        communications with the south side were thus interrupted, and it was
                        difficult to procure the ammunition or subsistence, the latter difficulty
                        being enhanced by the high waters impeding the working of the neighboring
                        mills. The trains with the wounded and prisoners were compelled to await at
                        Williamsport the subsiding of the river and the construction of boats, as
                        the pontoon bridge left at Falling Waters had been partially destroyed. The
                        enemy had not yet made his appearance but, as he was in condition to obtain
                        large reinforcements and our situation, for the reasons above mentioned was
                        becoming daily more embarrassing, it was deemed advisable to recross the
                        river. Part of the pontoon bridge was recovered, and new boats built so that
                        by the 13th a good bridge was thrown over the river at Falling Water.</p>
                    <p>"The enemy in force reached our front on the 12th. A position had been
                        previously selected to cover the Potomac from Williamsport to Falling
                        Waters, and an attack was awaited during that and the succeeding day. This
                        did not take place, though the two armies were in close proximity, the enemy
                        being occupied in fortifying his own lines. Our preparations being
                        completed, and the river though still deep, being pronounced fordable, the
                        army commenced to withdraw to the south side on the night of the 13th.</p>
                    <p>"Ewell's corps forded the river at Williamsport, those of Longstreet and hill
                        crossed upon the bridge. Owing tot he condition of the roads the troops did
                        not reach the bridge until after daylight on the 14th, and the crossing was
                        not completed until 1 P.M., when the bridge was removed.</p>
                    <p>"During the slow and tedious march to the bridge in the midst of a violent
                        storm of rain, some of the men lay down by the way to rest. Officers sent
                        back for them failed to find many in the obscurity of the night, and these,
                        with some stragglers, fell into the hands of the enemy."</p>
                    <p>We see nothing in this report that throws any new light upon the real aspect
                        of affairs between the two armies when confronting each other at
                        Williamsport. It is evident that Lee expected to be attacked by Meade before
                        he re-crossed the Potomac, and was as well prepared for it as possible; but
                        we must infer from his own account of it, that he was not in condition to
                        await an attack as a matter of choice. On the contrary he escaped across the
                        Potomac as soon as it was pronounced fordable. He does not say whether he
                        had received a fresh supply of ammunition, but we doubt not that he did as
                        soon as it was possible to get anything across the river.</p>
                    <p>What Lee's purpose was when he re-crossed the Potomac is not made known, but
                        from the following paragraph he intimates that he had further aggressive
                        movements in view. He says:</p>
                    <p>"Owing to the swollen condition of the Shenandoah river the plan of
                        operations which had been contemplated when we re-crossed the Potomac could
                        not be put in execution, and before the water had subsided the movements of
                        the enemy induced me to cross the Blue Ridge and take position south of the
                        Rappahannock, which was accordingly done."</p>
                    <p>It is worthy to not that Gen. Lee gives no estimate of his losses. He says
                        they were "severe," and embraced "an unusual proportion of distinguished and
                        valuable officers," but he does not pretend to approximate the number of men
                        killed, wounded and missing.</p>
                    <p>Upon the whole the report of Lee is tolerably candid, and as a part of the
                        history of this bloody war directly affecting the Cumberland Valley, the
                        material portions of it, as herewith given, will be read with more than
                        ordinary interest by our people.</p>

                <excerpt>". . . the Examiner also treats of the fabulous rates at which the
                    commonest necessaries of life are held as the great peril that now threatens the
                    existence of the traitors' government."</excerpt>
                <transcript>
                    <p>The voice of lamentation and mourning comes up from the dominions of Treason
                        on every side. Maddened by temporary successes in the field, the foes of the
                        government became insolent and relentless in their career of crime and their
                        hearts were gladdened with the hope that they should rule the continent and
                        doom Freedom to an early grave. But their season of joy and rejoicing has
                        been changed for one of universal sorrow. Retribution seems to have smitten
                        them in the field; in their usurped departments of power; in
                        homes--everywhere, indeed, that the avenging hand of justice could bow them
                        in humiliation and shame.</p>
                    <p>The late rebel papers are filled with curses upon their leaders and grief for
                        the woes inflcited [sic] upon their people. The Richmond <emph rend="italic"
                            >Sentinel</emph> is sad because the South is filled with "croakers and
                        grumblers" who see no hope for the triumph of traitors, and it laments the
                        "sufferings of the people." The <emph rend="italic">Dispatch</emph> warns
                        the bogus government and the people that the "distress from high prices" is
                        now "the greatest danger to the Confederacy." The <emph rend="italic"
                        >Whig</emph> is gloomy because of the fearful depreciation of rebel
                        currency; and the <emph rend="italic">Examiner</emph> also treats of the
                        fabulous rates at which the commonest necessaries of life are held as the
                        great peril that now threatens the existence of the traitors' government.
                        The <emph rend="italic">Sentinel</emph>, in denouncing the "croakers and
                        grumblers" charges them with being the authors of the depreciation of the
                        currency, and declares that "they seem to be laboring diligently" for the
                        ruin of the rebel cause. It adds that they have but to sow the seeds of
                        distrust among the soldiers, and "it needs no prophet to tell what will
                        inevitably and speedily follow. Under the head of "Sufferings of the
                        People," it relates instances of suffering among the widows of soldiers, and
                        adds that "the curse of Heaven will be upon the land if these widows and
                        their children are allowed to cry for bread in vain." The same paper calls
                        Jeff. Davis to "tax the people high" and "suppress high prices by law!"</p>
                    <p>On the subject of the distress of the people, the <emph rend="italic"
                            >Dispatch</emph> says:</p>
                    <p>"The rapid advance in all necessaries of clothing and subsistence threatens
                        us with great distress. <emph rend="italic">There is no disguising the
                        fact</emph>. We cannot see how unemployed persons, and how those who live on
                        incomes and salaries, are to get along, especially at the inclement season
                        of the year now rapidly approaching. How are they to buy shoes and clothing
                        at the present rates? Nay, how long are these rates to prevail? A great
                        auction may in a day or two run them all up fifty per cent! An auction thus
                        has become to be regarded by the people with as much dread as a battle! A
                        defeat on the battle-field could hardly bring more suffering upon them.
                        These questions are growing daily more and more important. Something must be
                        done. Produce must be distributed, prices must be reduced, gains must be
                        disgorged, or there will be suffering intense, and intense suffering will
                        beget, what? Think of it."</p>
                    <p>The same paper deplores the new draft, and says:</p>
                    <p>"Already we are beginning to feel the want of labor in those employments that
                        are indispensable to existence. What are the people to do this winter for
                        clothing, fuel and for other prime necessities of tife [sic], if the few
                        producers who are left are turned into consumers by being drafted into the
                        army. Our most pressing danger is the immense privation and suffering our
                        people may endure if the producing power is any further diminished."</p>
                    <p>In the extreme South and Southwest there is if possible still greater
                        destitution and sorrow among the deluded people who in an evil hour gave
                        themselves over to the crime of treason. When this causeless, wicked war was
                        commenced by them, their land was teeming with wealth and plenty; but now by
                        their own wanton rebellion against the government that gave them peace,
                        protection and prosperity, they have spread a withering desolation over
                        their own homes. Such are the fruits of treason in the South, and the only
                        places where their wants are supplied and the general desolation measurably
                        remedied, are where the Old Flag asserts its supremacy and gathers the
                        people again under its protecting folds.</p>

                    <p>Capt. James M. Brown, of this place, has handed us the subjoined letter from
                        Rev. T.V. Moore, formerly of Greencastle, but now of Richmond. He has

                        concerning them:</p>
                    <p>Richmond, Sept. 16, 1863.</p>
                    <p>Dear Sir: In accordance with your request in your letter of August 19th, I
                        visited the nine citizens of Chambersburg here in prison. They are well, and
                        say they are kindly treated and supplied with every thing they need. I
                        loaned Mr. Culbertson some money, and took them to apply to me for anything
                        they wanted. I will do all I can to make their situation as comfortable as
                        possible, and will see them as often as I can. I applied to Judge Ould
                        concerning their release. He said he had been trying to effect an
                        arrangement with the U.S. Government by which non-combatants should not be
                        imprisoned, and as soon as that was done, these men should be discharged.
                        Perhaps if you were to get your Congressman, or other influential citizens
                        to write to Washington, something might be done to put an end to this
                        imprisonment of peaceful citizens on both sides. I have asked Judge Ould to
                        put their names first, if possible, on the list of exchanges as soon as any
                        thing can be done. I fervently hope that something may soon be done to this
                        end, but in the meantime let their friends know that any thing in my power
                        to promote their comfort will be done. If in any other way I can render you
                        or any of my former friends in Pennsylvania any service, it will be done
                        with great pleasure. Meanwhile I am</p>
