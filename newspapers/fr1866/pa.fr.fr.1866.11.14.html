<b>Money and Business</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Noting that the "present condition of the country is peculiarly sound," the
                    editors refute the notion that an economic disaster is looming.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Some apprehensions are felt in the country about business revulsions, the
                        probable reduction of values, and the violent contraction of all channels of
                        industry and enterprise down to the old standard before the war. We regard
                        such a result not only as altogether improbable but as absolutely
                        impossible. There is nothing in the present condition of the country to
                        justify such apprehensions. There can be no violent change in business
                        operations unless business men are generally in debt beyond their means, and
                        a sudden contraction of accommodations by the banks with a fatal reduction
                        of values follow, when the bubble of overstrained credit bursts. All our
                        previous financial panics were produced by excessive over-trading and
                        extravagant indebtedness among the people. When the last feather would be
                        piled upon the back of credit, it would break down, and panic would complete
                        the work of destruction.</p>
                    <p>The present condition of the country is peculiarly sound. Speculators may be
                        embarrassed, and many of them may fail, but it cannot effect the general
                        condition of the people. Never before in the history of the nation were the
                        people as free from debt; never before were they as wealthy; and instead of
                        the country wanting means, the people have a superabundance of money, or
                        what would at once command money. It is true that there has been gradual
                        contraction of the currency, and it has limited operations immensely in
                        speculative circles; but that class is but a small proportion of the people.
                        Their operations have been unsuccessful within the last two years. Most
                        speculations have proved unfortunate, as they ever will when the nation is
                        returning gradually from inflation toward specie payments; but it does not
                        so much as create a ripple of uneasiness among the substantial producers of
                        the country, who are its main source of wealth.</p>
                    <p>Franklin county is as fair an illustration of the general condition of the
                        country as any other, and a little reflection will show how baseless is the
                        apprehension of financial revulsion. The active business men who expanded
                        largely during the war when money was superabundant and was expended
                        lavishly, feel severely the altered condition of things; but it is not
                        because we are approaching any violent change in financial affairs. Look for
                        a moment at the paper circulation of this county in 1864 when business and
                        speculation were in their highest tide. The Bank of Chambersburg then had
                        $511,000 of circulation, and $475,000 of deposits--giving it nearly a
                        million of resources to aid business operations. Now the same Bank has but
                        $260,000 of circulation, under the national law, and but $175,000
                        deposits--thus reducing the capacity of the Bank more than half a million
                        dollars, and of course reducing just to that extent its accommodations to
                        the people. True, we have Banks in Greencastle, Waynesboro and Shippensburg,
                        but their aggregate circulation does not reach over $175,000, leaving a
                        large diminution of the local paper circulation in our midst. In addition to
                        this, it must be considered that probably $200,000 of other State
                        circulation has been withdrawn, and the government has also been steadily
                        retiring green-backs, so that the aggregate contraction of paper circulation
                        in this county alone is over half a million. Government securities have
                        absorbed hundred of thousands of dollars from our farmers, all of which are
                        laid away as so much productive surplus means, which could be called out at
                        any time if the legitimate business interests of the country demanded it.</p>
                    <p>The contraction now felt in business operations pertains to but a small class
                        of the people. Merchants sell one-fourth or one-half less goods than two
                        years ago, and all who supply other than the necessaries of life naturally
                        feel restricted in their business; but the great mass of the people, upon
                        whom rest our great financial structure, never was so free from debt and
                        never so sound. The towns, which gathered the rich harvest of the war only
                        to plunge it into extravagance and speculation, must suffer. Many will be
                        crippled; many will retire with partial loss; a few will break when the
                        gradual contraction reaches a certain point, but those who survive will find
                        themselves back again to a legitimate business and will do well again. But
                        while the towns gathered and squandered the riches flung out so profusely by
                        war, the great producing classes also gathered from year to year, as their
                        crops commanded fabulous prices. They have not been tempted from their
                        frugal ways, but have saved their profits, and now have their new acres, or
                        mortgages, or Government bonds to attest their prosperity.</p>
                    <p>Let no man be deluded by the fear of financial panic. If half the business
                        men of Chambersburg, or Greencastle, or Waynesboro, or Mercersburg, would
                        fail, it would not lessen the price of a single acre of farm-land about
                        those towns. It might make stores and shops unsaleable, but there is not an
                        acre of productive land in Franklin county that cannot command a purchaser
                        at a high price any day, because the farmers were never so able to purchase,
                        and land never possessed such intrinsic value as it does now. And what is
                        true of the country generally is equally true of the cities as a rule.
                        Speculators and a limited class of jobbers may be crippled, but money never
                        was more abundant for first-class borrowers than it is in the cities now.
                        Money cannot be borrowed on anything but undoubted security. It cannot be
                        had for doubtful enterprises; but for legitimate business purposes it is
                        abundant at a low rate of interest. Looking at the nation throughout,
                        therefore, both city and country, the financial condition of the people
                        never was more sound than now, and panic or serious revulsion is impossible.
                        Fatal revulsions can only follow a sudden reduction of the substantial
                        values of the country, and that can come only when there is no class able to
                        purchase them at fair prices. So far from the people being unable to
                        maintain the price of lands, stocks, bonds, &amp;c., they never were so
                        abundantly able as now, and we look for the nation to move on gradually to
                        specie payments without any general revulsion being possible. It may take
                        many years to attain it, and bad government may retard it and even damage
                        our financial system; but any change of that kind could only diminish
                        government credit and currency, and thereby give a fictitious value to land
                        and reliable securities. We regard the inflation of values as possible, but
                        panic and violent reduction of values is among the impossibilities.</p>

<b>Who Are True Men?</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors chastise their counterparts at the Delaware County Republican
                    for challenging "Gov. Curtin's fidelity to the Republican party and to
                    Congress." To substantiate their claims, the Republican's editors based their
                    allegations on the fact that Curtin did not denounce Andrew Johnson in his last
                    governor's message. In response, the Repository's editors note that most
                    Republicans, in fact, had not broken ranks with President Johnson as of January
                    1866, the date of Curtin's last annual address. Indeed, it was not until
                    Johnson's veto of the Freedmen's Bureau Bill that the President's intentions
                    became clear.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The Great Verdict!</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>With all but six states having completed their elections, it is clear that
                    the Republicans will hold at least two-thirds of the seats in Congress. As such,
                    say the editors, the result represents "a declaration of the People that cannot
                    be misunderstood by any section of the country." If the southern states wish to
                    re-join the Union as full partners, they will not only have to accept the
                    constitutional amendments, but must enforce them as well, otherwise Congress
                    will offer much less generous terms.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Of the States now represented in our National Congress, all but Tennessee,
                        California, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Kentucky and Rhode Island have
                        elected their Representatives to the 40th Congress, and a Republican
                        majority of more than two-thirds is now positively assured. The States yet
                        to elect cannot effect the result. Conceding all that the most sanguine of
                        the other side claim in them, still there will remain the power in Congress
                        to veto the veto of the President when he shall interpose his despotic and
                        traitorous will against Freedom and Justice.</p>
                    <p>Nor is this emphatic verdict the result of political management. It is the
                        solemn, deliberate decree of the PEOPLE, asserting their supreme power in
                        opposition to perfidy in the highest places within their gift. By an
                        aggregate popular majority of nearly HALF A MILLION have the loyal States
                        declared against the policy of Andrew Johnson,
                        and in favor of the policy of Congress as defined
                        in the proposed amendments to the constitution.</p>
                    <p>Andrew Johnson appealed to the People. He went from place to place and in
                        mingled ribaldry and blasphemy he harangued them, always proposing to leave
                        the issue between himself and Congress to their decision. He prostituted the
                        immense power of his administration to aid the cause of those who have been
                        overthrown, and his offices and plunder were bartered at every corner for
                        votes to sustain his treachery. Every man holding office by the appointment
                        of Mr. Lincoln, who did not betray his principles, was relentlessly
                        ostracized, and some blatant traducer of Mr. Lincoln's principles appointed.
                        But in defiance of all--spurning the bribes of power and the appeals to
                        ambition, the People have declared in thunder tones that the great cause for
                        which they gave countless sacrifices shall not be betrayed when it is about
                        to gather the fruits of its bloody victory.</p>
                    <p>This overwhelming declaration of the People cannot be misunderstood by any
                        section of the country. It demands the acceptance of the constitutional
                        amendments, and will enforce them, or terms of restoration not less severe,
                        if they are not accepted. Will the South still be blinded by passion to
                        reject the most generous terms ever offered by a conquerer to a conquered
                        people? If they do, upon themselves must be the consequences. The North will
                        not wait indefinitely for their pleasure. The work of reconstruction must be
                        consummated speedily, and if not done by the co-operation of the vanquished
                        upon the terms proposed, it will be done on terms less generous and more
                        just to all. The North has performed its part. Will the dregs of treason and
                        rebellion render a new and harsher policy necessary? With the rebellious
                        States this question now rests, and it is for them to decide whether there
                        shall be a still fuller measure of justice visited upon them for their
                        wanton war against the best government of earth!</p>

                    <p>THE DELEGATE ELECTIONS.--The election for Delegates to the Senatorial County
                        Convention was warmly contested in both wards of Chambersburg, and it
                        brought out some 100 votes in the borough. One ticket, regularly nominated
                        at a meeting in the ward, was favorable to Gov. Curtin and instructions, and
                        another ticket was run, made up partly of friends of Gov. Curtin, opposed to
                        the policy of instructions for any one, so that the vote did not exhibit the
                        relative strength of Senatorial candidates here. There was some little
                        excitement, and a few who had allowed themselves to become very fervent,
                        imagined that the party might be distracted because they were somewhat
                        distracted themselves, but all closed up as other contested delegate
                        elections close up, and the straight Curtin ticket had 90 majority. All
                        parties, of all shades of sentiment on the question, participated actively
                        in the contest, and will of course yield a cordial submission to the
                        decision of the party. In most of the districts about the town--Guilford,
                        Green and Hamilton, there was no contest: the sentiment of the party being
                        so overwhelmingly for Curtin as to forbid a contest. In Antrim no opposition
                        was made to the Curtin ticket, as all concluded that it must carry in a
                        contest; but notwithstanding that, there were 117 votes polled. In Quincy
                        they elected delegates adverse to instructions, and in Washington they
                        instructed for Mr. Stevens, as their first choice. Upon the whole we believe
                        that the elections were attended as they usually are when nominations are
                        contested, and the expression manifests an overwhelming sentiment in the
                        county in favor of Gov. Curtin for Senator. The proceedings of the
                        convention will be found elsewhere in to-day's paper.</p>

                    for a farmer's note, which they immediately cash at a discount then "clear out."<br>
