                    <p>Congress has now been in session six months and will, we trust, soon mature
                        its policy for the restoration of the rebellious States, by the adoption of
                        amendments to the constitution and the enactment of such laws as may be
                        essential to give them effect. It has been a task of the utmost magnitude,
                        and no reasonable man can complain of the inevitable delay. The emergency
                        demanded the most careful, patient, exhausting investigation, and Congress
                        did well, in disregard of the complaints of Johnsonites, copperheads and
                        rebels, to pursue its great work to a full and faithful completion. Not only
                        had the actual condition of the people of all classes in the rebel States to
                        be ascertained; but the conflicting views of true men in both branches of
                        the national legislature had to be consulted and harmonized on one common
                        line of action.</p>
                    <p>This we trust will be attained within a very few weeks. If it shall be deemed
                        essential to modify the action of the House on the proposed amendments, let
                        it be done; but let the Union men of Congress not fail to present to the
                        country some comprehensive and definite plan for the treatment and
                        restoration of the rebellious States. Congress can adopt no policy designed
                        to make treason infamous that will be in advance of the wishes of the
                        people, and the single peril is that the policy of the Union party may be so
                        stripped of justice, as to deny us guarantees against future traitors and
                        rebellion. The loyal people do not ask that the government shall stain its
                        history with vengeance. It asks no sacrifice of life, yields to
                        blood-stained traitors their liberty and property, but it does demand that
                        our nationality shall not be at once placed in jeopardy by the restoration
                        to power of the implacable foes of our free institutions, and it does demand
                        that they shall not be enabled to seize and control the government they so
                        persistently sought to destroy, until it is safely steered beyond the shoals
                        and rocks which now threaten it. It would be a most remarkable spectacle,
                        indeed, to see the Presidential contest of 1868 depend upon the votes of men
                        who in 1864 were waging wanton war to dismember and destroy the Federal
                        Union.</p>
                    <p>We have abiding faith in the wisdom of Congress, and when it shall have
                        presented its policy formally to the people we shall give it a most earnest
                        support; and while we do not ask hasty action, we earnestly trust that
                        before another month shall have passed, the issues will be distinctly
                        presented for the judgement of the people. When Congress shall have
                        perfected this great work and made proper provision for the maintenance of
                        the national credit, we hope that an early adjournment will follow. It has
                        been intimated that the session may be protracted to prevent an apostate
                        President from subverting the government and filling all important official
                        positions with the enemies of the party that clothed him with power. We
                        protest against such a selfish and cowardly policy. Andrew Johnson will do
                        all the harm he can or dare do. He may turn out every faithful officer, and
                        he may, as he doubtless will, conspire steadily with traitors and their
                        friends, to restore them to supreme power; but the safety against all his
                        evil designs and actions <emph rend="italic">is in the people!</emph> A
                        great party taking issue with men who are seeking to betray a nation into
                        the power of its enemies, must take higher grounds than the hope of honors
                        and plunder. The people care nothing for Andrew Johnson's patronage. They do
                        not want it, nor can they be influenced by men who attempt to exercise it
                        improperly; but they do want to save the nation, for which they have
                        sacrificed their richest blood and untold treasure, from the men who seek
                        its power solely to destroy it. There may be some peril in Congress
                        adjourning; but the greatest peril we can conceive of is to drag the Union
                        party down into a mere contest with a perfidious Executive about the plunder
                        he has to dispose of.</p>
                    <p>Let Congress wisely, patiently, patriotically perform its great duty, and
                        then go back to the people who elected them and render the account of their
                        stewardship. Let them wash their hands of all selfish or cowardly
                        considerations, and appeal to the supreme power of the nation--the people,
                        and they will be sustained. The issues can then be fairly presented, and the
                        people who saved the country in war by their matchless heroism and
                        sacrifices, will as surely save it in peace by their fidelity and
                        patriotism.</p>

                <summary>Although Congress has been deliberating what course of action it should
                    take to reconstruct the South for the past six months, the editors readily
                    concede that the enormity of the task requires such a lengthy period of time.
                    Indeed, they have every confidence that Congress has used its time well and will
                    enact a plan that both protects northerners' interests and respects the rights
                    of the "blood stained traitors." The only obstacle to achieving this goal is
                    President Johnson, whom the editors assert may try to subvert the government's
                    efforts.</summary>

                <commentary/>
                <excerpt/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>We admire the perseverance with which the President and his small brigade of
                        office-holders in Washington, labor to get the cabinet into some sort of
                        apparent harmony with the apostasy of the Executive. Divers serenaders have
                        been gotten up, an indefinite amount of music wasted, a profuse assortment
                        of genuine and mixed speeches have been made, but still confusion and
                        discord reign supreme in the constitutional councils of the President.
                        Seward goes the whole figure for the good reason that he is the father of
                        the institution. His brain created the policy, his vengeance devised the
                        insidious assaults the administration has made upon its friends and the
                        country, and it is most natural that he should require no drumming to fall
                        into line. M'Culloch, not being much of anything particularly in politics,
                        and what little he was or is being of coppery affinities, followed his
                        convictions and his interests in supporting the President, and like Welles,
                        would doubtless have run the guillotine for rebels just as willingly as the
                        other way, had the President asked it. Dennison loves his party, loves his
                        office, loves the President and loves Congress, and therefore says least
                        when he says most in his political speeches.</p>
                    <p>But Stanton, Harlan and Speed have been belligerents. They have been used to
                        some deference to their convictions, and they did not readily follow the new
                        paths in which their chief had wandered. A Jackson would have removed them,
                        and so would any consistent and honest Executive have acted; but a
                        blundering, groping apostate, trembling at every step lest he should offend
                        a rebel, while he had not the manhood to own his treachery, could not thus
                        dismiss cabinet officers for adhering to the principles which triumphed by
                        his election. He therefore resorted to strategy. It was well known to him
                        and his political managers, that neither of the three officers named would
                        support his policy; but it was finally deemed safe to try them and see
                        whether, out of politeness and deference to the President, they would not
                        say something that could be construed into an approval of Johnson. Stanton
                        was thus taken in and done for. He apologized for his former convictions on
                        negro suffrage and rebel disfranchisement, but at the same time tried to
                        make it appear that he was faithful to himself and his record. In this he
                        deceived nobody. The Democrats, who are the only trusted advisors of the
                        President, demand his removal for not saying more than he did, while any
                        average fool can see that, with the progress he has made toward Johnson's
                        policy, one more serenade or two at most, will play him squarely with his
                        old friends Seward and Blair. He was the only man in the nation they feared,
                        and the only man for whom the President had a wholesome terror; but the man
                        has now become master and the master the man. Mr. Stanton has done many good
                        acts, and some wrong acts during his cabinet career, but never before did
                        weakness betray itself in his sayings or doings. He is now nicely
                        balanced--which way will he fall?</p>
                    <p>Speed and Harlan were wiser than the hero of the War Department. They first
                        said nothing, because he had nothing to say. The latter chose to have
                        something to say, and therefore spoke the truth with all the dignity of a
                        man. He did not accept the proffered serenade, knowing well its purpose, and
                        he notified the tricksters who were running the concern that he was with the
                        Union party, always would be with the Union party, and never would consent
                        to betray its principles. To say this was of course understood to be a
                        direct and pointed censure of the President, although he still professes to
                        be of the Union organization, and Mr. Harlan is allowed to remain only
                        because he don't care a button how soon they turn him out or ask him to
                        resign. The cabinet is thus confused and worse confounded. None of them are
                        really for the President's policy but Seward, who is the author of it, and
                        will appropriate it to himself if it succeeds and charge it to Johnson if it
                        fails. Welles, M'Culloch and Dennison are simply in favor of holding cabinet
                        offices, while the other three are at heart against the President, and two
                        of them do not pretend to qualify or apologize for their belief. Such is the
                        condition of the administration. It is engaged in a great struggle with a
                        loyal Congress, and half its members are against its own policy, and but one
                        really disposed to press it upon the people. If we were a friend of Johnson
                        we should lose no time in demanding a new cabinet deal. No matter whether he
                        goes right or wrong, his cabinet can't be right!</p>

                <summary>Among the first reconstruction acts taken by Andrew Johnson, reports the

                    stock as well as iron and other materials to southern men on credit. Of course,
                    many of the notes were never paid; yet, Johnson refuses to push for proceedings
                    to compel payment. As a consequence, the federal government faces a loss of
                    close to $200,000,000 in revenues.</summary>
