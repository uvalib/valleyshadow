                <transcript>
                    <p>The time must be near at hand when Jefferson Davis will be tried, paroled or
                        discharged, and the sooner one or the other is done, the more creditable it
                        will be for the government. It seems clear that the President is determined
                        that Davis shall not be punished, and he has persistently refused any sort
                        of a trial that could possibly endanger his life, liberty or property.</p>
                    <p>Without pretending to determine whether Davis could be convicted of treason,
                        it is enough to know that it is too late to punish him in that way, when
                        most of his associates in crime have been pardoned, and some of them would
                        now be our law-makers had the President been able to carry out his policy.
                        As to his alleged complicity in the Booth conspiracy to assassinate Mr.
                        Lincoln, we do not pretend to express an opinion. The investigation of the
                        subject has been carried on privately, and there may be evidence on the
                        point of which the public is not advised. If there is sufficient testimony
                        to warrant a judicial investigation, there should be a trial as promptly as
                        the interests of justice will allow.</p>
                    <p>We do not apprehend, however, that Jefferson Davis either will be, or should
                        be, tried for treason or the assassination of Mr. Lincoln; but there is one
                        charge preferred against him which the government should not overlook. It
                        has been charged that the starvation and cruel neglect of prisoners in
                        Andersonville, Belle Island, Saulisbury and other points, was a part of the
                        system of warfare deliberately adopted by Davis, and the appalling
                        atrocities practiced upon our brave men in rebel prison-pens gives the
                        strongest possible color of truth, to say the least, to the fearful
                        accusation. It is not questioned that our prisoners were murdered in every
                        conceivable manner, some of them by the most studied cruelties. Werz, the
                        creature of Davis, who was subject to the orders of his chief, and who was
                        continued in his place as executioner long after the whole civilized world
                        had revolted at the barbarities of Andersonville, was tried, convicted and
                        executed as an inhuman monster. His death was pronounced an act of mercy to
                        mankind; but while he is thus condemned, what must be said of his chief? Had
                        Davis ordered it otherwise, the shivering maniacs of Andersonville might
                        have been restored to reason and sound health, but he refused to do so. At
                        least such seems to be the truth of history. Is it an error? If it is, the
                        world should know the fact. If it is not an error, the chief criminal should
                        pay the penalty already suffered by his menial servant.</p>
                    <p>We do not assume that Jefferson Davis is the man who should be held
                        responsible for the violation of the rules of war in the treatment of
                        prisoners; but it is most natural to suppose that, as he ruled most
                        despotically during his brief and bloody reign, he should answer for the
                        thousands of our heroic sons who were thus murdered. It will be a blistering
                        stain upon our fame if this deepest shade of the black record of rebellion
                        shall not. . . [illeg] the government to have done. We do not ask the life
                        of Jefferson Davis. We should gladly record his innocence of this terrible
                        charge; but if he is innocent, we ask to know who is guilty. Mr. Davis is
                        now a military prisoner. He was the chief military, as well as civil,
                        officer of the rebellion. He commanded its armies and dictated its policy.
                        He was captured by the military force, and to this day is in its custody.
                        Although indicted in a civil tribunal, he has never been in its custody or
                        plead to the charge preferred against him. The graver charge of murdering
                        prisoners is a military offence. No civil tribunal could, under the
                        circumstances, take cognizance of it. His forces were acknowledged
                        belligerents, and the crime was a violation of the laws of war. For this
                        offence, clearly committed by him or some of his subordinates, he should be
                        tried. The tribunal to decide upon his guilt or innocence should be one to
                        which the judgement of the world would bow. It should embrace the names of
                        Grant, Sherman, Meade, Thomas, Sheridan, and Hancock; men too brave to
                        render an unjust verdict. They would settle this grave issue satisfactorily
                        to all but the guilty, and if they should pronounce Davis the criminal, he
                        should die. If they would acquit him, he should be discharged from all
                        further restraint.</p>
                    <p>We appeal to the government, especially to Congress, not to be unmindful of
                        this monstrous crime whose deadly fruits are still felt in so many bereaved
                        households. It is due to our brave soldiers of the Republic that it be done.
                        It is due to humanity that the fiends who sent thousands to untimely graves
                        should be made to answer, and the history of the most causeless war of the
                        world will be incomplete without a thorough investigation by some competent
                        tribunal. None but the guilty and their apologists can complain of what we
                        ask, and we submit whether justice to friend and foe does not demand that
                        Jefferson Davis, the chief of traitors, should be arraigned and tried for
                        this crowning crime against Humanity and Heaven.</p>

                <summary>The editors appeal to the federal government to proceed with its case
                    against Jefferson Davis. Though they acknowledge it would be difficult to bring
                    Davis up on the charge of treason, since most of his fellow Confederates have
                    already been pardoned, they do insist, however, that Davis should stand trial
                    for his role in the horrible mistreatment and wholesale murder of Union soldiers
                    at Andersonville and other Confederate prisoner-of-war camps.</summary>

                <transcript>
                    <p>The President's message, received in Congress on Monday the 2nd ult., the
                        first day of the session, has been duly published to the country. There is
                        nothing remarkable about it except its weakness, and the universal
                        disappointment it has occasioned. The President seems to have learned
                        nothing from the logic of events, except perhaps a little decency in
                        referring to Congress. He no longer considers it necessary to describe it as
                        an "unconstitutional body hanging on the verge of the government." He
                        satisfies the desires of the people for new suggestions on the subject of
                        the re-construction of the country, by a submission of his "policy" exactly
                        as he argued it, but in a more respectful style than he proclaimed it a
                        hundred times, while "swinging around the circle" before the fall elections.
                        The people having as they thought heard a full discussion of the merits of
                        the "policy" and having decided by a majority of 400,000 against it, are
                        naturally struck with the brilliancy and originality of the President on the
                        subject. They have learned, however, one thing, that they have to deal with
                        a man bold enough to resist their sovereign will, and to undertake any
                        usurpation which his interest or ambition may dictate. They realize further
                        that to Congress alone they must look for some plan for the pacification of
                        the country on the basis of justice and honor, safety for the future, and
                        for the present protection against the designs of a faithless President,
                        bold and ready at any time opportunity may offer to overturn the liberties
                        of the country. But protected by a loyal Congress, this part of the
                        President's message will be read by the people with wonder and contempt that
                        a man should be so stolid as to repeat by rote, and recommend what they had
                        so lately rejected. The remainder of the message is of still less importance
                        than that just referred to. There are no suggestions made in reference to
                        the various departments of the government, and for information concerning
                        them he refers Congress to the reports of heads of departments. He advises
                        legislation necessary for the preservation of the Mississippi levees, and
                        urges Congress to aid the Southern States to reorganize their agriculture.
                        He recommends that the district of Columbia be allowed to delegate in
                        Congress to represent it, as territories are at present represented. He
                        refers to the failure of the French Emperor to remove his troops from
                        Mexico, according to agreement, one detachment this fall, one next spring
                        and one next fall. The Emperor has deferred action until spring when he
                        promises to remove his troops all in a body. This change of plan has been
                        disapproved by our government, but it remains to be seen whether this
                        disapproval will have any effect on the determination of the French Emperor.</p>
                    <p>The mission of Gen. Sherman to Mexico which occasioned considerable anxiety,
                        it seems is merely in an advisory capacity to Minister Campbell, and for the
                        obtaining of information necessary to maintain proper intercourse with the
                        Republic of Mexico. Sincere hopes are expressed of an amicable settlement of
                        the Alabama and other claims on Great Britain, arising from the depredation
                        of the rebel pirates sent out from British ports during the late war. A plea
                        is made for clemency and amnesty in favor of the Fenian prisoners recently
                        convicted and sentenced to death in Canada. The country is congratulated on
                        the completion of the Atlantic Telegraph, and on an earlier completion of
                        the Pacific Rail Road than was hoped for. The rights of American citizens
                        abroad are commended to the protection of Congress, which will no doubt be
                        attended to after an investigation of the New Orleans massacre, and the
                        rights of American citizens at home are secured. This is a brief summary of
                        the Message, which of itself is not long, but for all the satisfaction it
                        gives to the American people on the subjects in which they are most vitally
                        interested, might as well never have been written. The best that can be said
                        of it is that, it is written in a dispassionate manner, betrays little or
                        none of the malice and spleen that usually pervade the Executive's speeches,
                        is earnest in its appeals and rather dignified in its arguments. Beyond this
                        if it has any merit, we have failed to discover it.</p>

                <summary>In evaluating the tone and scope of President Johnson's message, the
                    editorial states that there was nothing "remarkable" about the speech, "except
                    its weakness, and the universal disappointment it has occasioned." It seems, the
                    piece relates, that Johnson has "learned nothing" from the election.</summary>

                <summary>The article reports that John Mayberry recovered his horse last Monday, a
                    week after it had been stolen, though the thief managed to escape. But, it
                    suggests, had Mayberry acted earlier, "the thief would have been apprehended"
                    before he got a chance to sell the horse to an unsuspecting buyer and abscond
                    with the profits.</summary>

                <summary>Christian Frantz, son of Samuel Frantz, broke his leg just below the knee
                    in an accident that occurred last Saturday while he was wrestling with a school
                    mate. Dr. Grub set the limb; the boy is expected to make a full recovery. Also
                    of note: the women of the M. E. Church of Greencastle will hold a fair on
                    December 22nd to raise money for the erection of a new church.</summary>

                <summary>It is reported that J. R. Welsh will replace A. G. Nevin as the Post Master
                    for Waynesboro. Evidently, Nevin, who received his commission during Lincoln's
                    tenure, was removed because he refused to adhere to Johnson's "Policy." In other
                    news from Waynesboro, David Ditch and Thaddeus Cook were arrested last week and
                    brought before Judge Bender for stealing turkeys. The men are now in jail in
                    Chambersburg awaiting trial.</summary>
