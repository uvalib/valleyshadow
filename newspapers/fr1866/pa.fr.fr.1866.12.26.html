<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>

                    their appraisals as to how the government will be organized and who will be

<b>What Of Reconstruction?</b><br> (Column )<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors characterize the arguments put forth by southern leaders to
                    justify their reluctance to accept the proposed amendments as disingenuous.
                    Though there are no assurances that ratification of the amendments will
                    automatically result in a re-admission, just as the southerners claim, their
                    failure to adopt the terms prescribed by Congress stem from their refusal to
                    accept their defeat more than anything else.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It is one of the favorite pretexts of the rebels for resisting the adoption
                        of the proposed amendments of the constitution, that they have no assurance
                        of their restoration to civil rights and representation if they should
                        accept the amendments. We regard it as too late to question the position of
                        the Republican party on this issue. The last session of Congress, after
                        considering various propositions relating to the reconstruction of the
                        rebellious States, finally adopted the amendments with almost entire
                        unanimity, and on that issue [illeg] their governments. The amendments were
                        published in every Republican organ as the platform of reconstruction to be
                        decided by the votes of the people, and Republican campaigners pledged the
                        faith of the party that the adoption and faithful compliance with the
                        amendments by the South would solve the difficult problem of reconstruction.
                        Had Congress declared in advance, that upon the acceptance of the amendments
                        the rebellious States would be admitted, it could not have more emphatically
                        committed the nation to the position. It hastened to admit Tennessee as soon
                        as the legislature of that State ratified the amendments, and had other
                        States imitated the example of Tennessee, there can be no question that they
                        would have been accepted in like manner.</p>
                    <p>It is true that Georgia cannot hope, by the ratification of the amendments,
                        to secure the admission of the ex-rebel Vice President Stephens and the
                        ex-rebel Senator H. V. Johnson to the United States Senate; nor can such men
                        as ex-rebel Senator Orr, ex-rebel Treasurer Worth, ex-rebel General Humphrey
                        hope to be continued as the Executives of their respective States. The
                        amendments in express terms disqualify all such men for holding office, and
                        to adopt the amendments and insist upon choosing such Executives and such
                        Senators would be the hollowest mockery. Nor can they expect to be excused,
                        by the ratification of the amendments, for the wanton barbarities practiced
                        in many States upon Union men and Freedmen. While the nation has plighted
                        its faith to those who were driven from wicked rebellion only by the sword
                        of the conqueror, and practically pledged their forfeited lives, property
                        and immunity from the punishment the laws demand for their crimes, it exacts
                        from them in return a faithful acceptance of and obedience to the provisions
                        of the amendments. To reject them will have the merit of candor; to attempt
                        to evade them while in form accepting them would be a fraud upon the loyal
                        people who have saved their government by appalling sacrifice, and an insult
                        to the law-making power of the loyal people that has proffered the most
                        generous terms ever offered to subjugated traitors in the history of
                        nations.</p>
                    <p>Most of the rebel States have already rejected the proposed amendments, and
                        by most decisive votes in the legislatures. But one Governor elected by
                        those who rebelled against the government, has ventured to commend the
                        ratification, and his counsel was unheeded. We see intimations that a
                        renewed effort will be made to have those States re-consider their action on
                        this important question, but its failure seems inevitable. What then remains
                        to be done? The singular spectacle is presented of a sullen, obstinate
                        rejection of most magnanimous terms by a people who have no right under the
                        government but the right to suffer the fearful penalties imposed by the laws
                        for their offences. They have forfeited life, property, everything. They
                        persisted in their bloody effort to overthrow the government as long as they
                        could marshal the battalions of crime to make new hecatombs of dead. They
                        professed no love or sympathy for the government even when they yielded to
                        the stern arbiter of war. They bowed from inexorable necessity; and now they
                        propose to settle the question of their restoration as if they were victors
                        instead of vanquished; rulers instead of criminals. They reject the
                        proffered terms of the conquerer, and propose none in return, as if they
                        courted the inflexible arm of justice to adjust the issue between them and
                        their generous conqueror.</p>
                    <p>We have hoped, at times almost against hope, that the rebellious States would
                        not force the issue to be made up anew. Unless the madness of treason still
                        rules, they will not do so. They cannot have an attribute for their cause
                        that could appeal with the remotest hope of success to the people of the
                        North, and, with the new Congress already chosen and instructed on the
                        question, the result of such a suicidal course must be apparent to all. The
                        amendments will be adopted; the rebellious States will be territorialized;
                        the work of restoration will go on without even the voice of treason being
                        mingled with the voice of the loyal people, and the government will rest
                        solely in the hands of the States which have maintained their fidelity to
                        the Union for years to come--certainly until on the great issues and logical
                        results of the war there can be no disagreement between the North and South.
                        This result must be obvious to traitor as well as loyalist, and if treason
                        will persist in drinking the bitter cup to the dregs, it will be the act of
                        the South and not the act of the North. The refusal to ratify the amendments
                        is an admonition to the North that treason is not yet conquered, and the
                        work must be completed. If traitors will not rule justly and loyally, there
                        are those in the rebellious States who will do so, and in their hands will
                        be placed the political power and destiny of those States, and once placed
                        there, there can be no appeal for the rights so insolently rejected. The
                        whole North is most desirous to have the South restored to full fellowship
                        upon the basis of the amendments, and with one voice it appeals to those who
                        have made causeless and desolating war to accept the generous terms proposed
                        by Congress. It may yet be done, but a month hence it will be too late and
                        too late forever. With the South this issue rests, and it must answer to the
                        living and to posterity for its action in accepting or rejecting generous
                        and enduring Restoration.</p>
