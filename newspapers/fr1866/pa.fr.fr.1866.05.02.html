<b>Disfranchisement of Deserters</b><br> (Column 7)<blockquote>

                        ballots from any person or persons embraced in the provisions and subject to
                        the disability imposed by said act of Congress, approved March 3d, one
                        thousand eight hundred and sixty-five, and it shall be unlawful for any such

                        them shall receive or consent to receive any such unlawful ballot or ballots
                        from any such disqualified person, he or they so offending shall be guilty
                        of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof in any court of quarter
                        sessions of this commonwealth, he shall, for each offence, be sentenced to
                        pay a fine of not less than one hundred dollars, and to undergo an
                        imprisonment in the jail of the proper county for not less than sixty days.</p>

                        aforesaid, shall at any election hereafter to be held in this commonwealth,
                        vote, or tender to the officers thereof, and offer to vote, a ballot or
                        ballots, any person so offending shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor,
                        and on conviction thereof in any court of quarter sessions of this
                        commonwealth, shall for each offence be punished in like manner as provided

                        any ballot or ballots to the officers of any election hereafter to be held
                        in this commonwealth, such person so offending shall be guilty of a
                        misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof in any court of quarter sessions of
                        this commonwealth, shall be punished in like manner as is provided in the
                        second section of this act in the case of officers of such election
                        receiving such unlawful ballot or ballots.</p>
                    <p>SECTION 5. That it shall be the duty of the Adjutant General of this
                        commonwealth to procure, from the proper officers of the United States,
                        certified copies of all rolls and records containing official evidence of
                        the fact of the desertion of all persons who were citizens of this
                        commonwealth, and who were deprived of citizenship and disqualified by the
                        said act of Congress of March 3d, 1865, and cause to be recorded and
                        preserved, in books to be provided and kept for that purpose, in his office,
                        full and complete exemplifications of such rolls and records, embracing the
                        names of all such disqualified persons as had their residence within the
                        limits of said counties respectively at the time of their being marked or
                        designated as deserters; and it shall be the duty of the clerks of the
                        several courts of quarter sessions of this commonwealth to preserve in books
                        to be kept for the purpose all such copies and exemplifications of such
                        rolls and records so furnished, and to allow access thereto, and furnish
                        certified copies therefrom, on request, in like manner as in the case of
                        other records of such courts.</p>
                    <p>SECTION 6. That a certified copy or extract of any such record from the clerk
                        of a court of quarter sessions of this commonwealth shall be prima facia
                        evidence before any election board of the fact of desertion and consequent
                        disability and disqualification as an elector: Provided, that if any person
                        shall willfully use or present any false, fraudulent or forged paper
                        purporting to be a certified copy or extract as aforesaid, he shall be
                        deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction thereof shall be punished
                        as misdemeanors are now by law punishable; And provided, however, that if by
                        the production of a certificate of his honorable discharge it shall appear
                        that such person so offering to vote was in the military service of the
                        United States before and at the term of his being drafted into such service,
                        and thereupon failing to report, or in case of the fact of desertion
                        appearing by certified copy of his company roll, if it shall appear that he
                        was afterwards acquitted thereof, and honorably discharged, such proof shall
                        be received as evidence to disprove his said disqualification. And provided,
                        further, That if any person liable to be objected to as disqualified, as
                        aforesaid, shall produce before any board of election officers any false or
                        fraudulent paper, purporting, or pretended to be his honorable discharge
                        from the United States service, he shall be deemed guilty of forgery, and on
                        conviction thereof shall be punished as persons are now by law punishable
                        for forgery.</p>
                    <p>SECTION 7. That it shall be the duty of the judges and inspectors of
                        elections hereafter to be held in this commonwealth whenever the name of any
                        person offering to them a ballot or ballots shall be found upon a certified
                        copy or extract furnished from said rolls or records by a clerk of a court
                        of quarter sessions, marked as a deserter or whenever any person shall be
                        objected to as disqualified as aforesaid at any election by any qualified
                        voter, at the request or suggestion of such person, so offering a ballot, to
                        examine such person on oath or affirmation as to the fact appearing from
                        such certificate or alleged against him by the elector so objecting, and if
                        he deny it, as to his reasons therefor; provided however, that if any of his
                        answers under such examination are false, such persons shall be deemed
                        guilty of the crime of perjury, and upon conviction thereof he shall be
                        punished as persons are now punishable by law for perjury.</p>
                    <p>SECTION 8. That it shall be the duty of the sheriffs in the several counties
                        of this commonwealth to insert, in their proclamations of elections
                        hereafter to be held, the first four sections of this act, with the preamble
                        thereof.</p>
                    <p>SECTION 9. That in the trial of all cases arising under this act, it shall be
                        the duty of the Courts trying the same to inquire into and determine any
                        question of fact as to alleged desertion involved therein, upon proofs
                        furnished by exemplications, or extracts from such rolls and records, duly
                        certified by the proper clerk of a court of quarter sessions, which are
                        hereby made evidence thereof, and also from such proofs by parole as may be
                        given in evidence by either party.</p>

<b>The Issues of the Contest</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Contrary to the claims made by the Democrats and other rebel sympathizers,
                    avow the editors, the Union party "does not seek to prevent the restoration of
                    the rebel states." In fact, they insist that the nation would benefit immensely
                    if the re-admission process could be accelerated. Congress is not responsible
                    for the failure to achieve this goal; rather blame rests entirely on the
                    southerners, for they consistently elect "traitors" to office despite laws
                    barring them from serving.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>No intelligent voter can mistake the issues to be determined by the next
                        election in Pennsylvania and other Northern States. Ingeniously as our
                        opponents may seek to disguise them, they are nevertheless palpable and defy
                        concealment. The persistent allegations that the Union majority in Congress
                        and the Union party seek to prevent the restoration of the rebel States is
                        not uttered by any intelligent man without a consciousness of falsehood. The
                        weak and ignorant may be made thus to believe; but none of fair
                        comprehension can so grievously err, and the leaders who start out with such
                        a charge against the Union party, do so with a deliberate determination to
                        deceive as to the position of both parties. They know that such is not the
                        purpose or desire of the Union party, and they do not want the people to
                        know what their real purpose is, and hence they seek to accomplish by fraud
                        what they feel assured they cannot accomplish by fairly submitting the real
                        issues to the people.</p>
                    <p>The Union majority of Congress and the Union party of Pennsylvania do not seek to prevent the restoration of the rebel
                        States. On the contrary they desire their admission into full fellowship as
                        soon as is possible to effect it with safety to the Nation just rescued from
                        the deadly assaults of treason. They do insist, however, that the men who
                        plotted treason in Congress, and with perjury upon their souls used their
                        positions under the government to effect its overthrow, shall not be allowed
                        to resume their positions and power in the Republic, to effect by diplomacy
                        and statesmanship what they failed to effect by wanton war.</p>
                    <p>Treason was for many years before the war defiant in Congress, and filled the
                        high places of power in many of the rebel States. They were encouraged in
                        their perfidious work by Democratic Presidents and the Democratic party
                        generally, and at last the Nation reaped the logical fruits of their work. A
                        war, the most stupendous of history, sacrificing a million lives, and untold
                        millions of treasure, was the retribution the people suffered by reason of
                        their tolerance of treason in authority.</p>
                    <p>The Union party mean that henceforth treason shall be powerless to repeat its
                        bloody record. They mean that traitors shall not
                        be admitted into Congress; that States which rebelled against the sovereign
                        power of the general government, maintaining treasonable governments for
                        four years, and exhausting their energies and resources in the work of
                        dismemberment and desolation, shall be restored to their rights only when
                        they shall come with evidence of honest submission to the decision of the
                        sword, their own chosen arbiter.</p>
                    <p>The war has its lessons for the present and for history. It has legitimate,
                        logical, inexorable results. The Union party mean to accept them and to make
                        discomfited treason do likewise. It has wiped out the blistering stain of
                        human bondage. It must be done in fact as well as in letter of the law.
                        Equality of all people, of all conditions and colors, before the law is one
                        of the inevitable teachings, one of the imperious necessities of the new
                        order of things in the South. Conventional equalities, such as the right of
                        suffrage and eligibility to places of official trust, are questions for the
                        States to determine in their own way; but the power of humble and opulent,
                        the white and black, to maintain the inalienable rights of man to life,
                        liberty, property and the pursuit of happiness, is a duty that the victor
                        loyalist must teach the vanquished traitor, because the traitor was against
                        it.</p>
                    <p>Had the rebellious States accepted the issues of the war in good faith, as
                        they doubtless would have done but for the treachery of President Johnson,
                        they might have been represented in Congress long since. Had they promptly
                        provided for the equal natural rights of the emancipated slaves in their
                        respective States--empowered them to contract for their own labor, to
                        enforce their contracts in the courts, to be parties to suits and witnesses
                        in the same, to hold and enjoy their property gathered by the fruits of
                        their own labor, accepted amendments to the constitution repudiating all
                        debts incurred in past or future rebellions, and chosen men of even a shade
                        of loyalty to Congress, they would not now be seeking in vain for admissions
                        to representation.</p>
                    <p>It is a fact which all the sophistry and political ingenuity of our opponents
                        cannot deny, that the insurgent States have adhered to their treasonable
                        convictions, and to this day their allegiance to the government as a
                        sovereignty. They as earnestly teach the right of secession now as before
                        the war, and prove their faith in their principles by electing Governors,
                        Senators and Congressmen who are the representatives of treason now as they
                        were before the rebellion. There has not been a single loyal legislature
                        chosen in the rebel States--not one that has not by every act, resisted the
                        logical, palpable results of the war. They have in nearly every State
                        refused the freedmen even the right to contract for labor; a few have under
                        the pressure from Washington, reluctantly agreed to repudiate their debt;
                        but all, like North Carolina, take the earliest opportunity to elect men to
                        office who mean to pay their debt. They have not in a single instance,
                        elected a Governor who was not so chosen because he was a traitor, and had
                        no apology to offer for his treason, and nine tenths of the men chosen to
                        Congress from those States, were open, earnest, unflinching traitors until
                        treason was utterly overwhelmed. Do such men now seek to rule our country
                        because they love it or because they hate it?</p>
                    <p>Upon the head of Andrew Johnson rests the fearful responsibility for this
                        condition of our distracted country. There is not a traitor in the South who
                        is not re-inspired in his hatred for free institutions by the shameless
                        perfidy of the President, and his unspeakable recreancy is to-day the
                        fountain that gives life, energy and hope to every impulse of treason
                        throughout the land. He, in an evil hour, listened to the whispers of
                        ambition and the seductive flattery of crime, and the treason he would once
                        have made infamous, he would now clothe with honor and power; and relying
                        upon his support, there is not a traitor who does not hope to defy the loyal
                        sentiment of the nation, cloud its sacrifices with dishonor, and have the
                        favor and patronage of an apostate ruler as his reward. In this work of
                        shame and death the Democracy gladly join, willing to sacrifice the Republic
                        to regain power by the restoration of blood-stained and defiant traitors.</p>
                    <p>Judge the parties now seeking the favor of the people by those who desire
                        their success. Is there a traitor or a rebel murderer from the Potomac or
                        the Ohio to the Gulf, who does not heartily, earnestly hope for the success
                        of the Democracy in Pennsylvania? They have the same purposes in view,
                        cherish the same hospitality to our free institutions and make common cause
                        to give treason a decisive triumph by charging it with the destiny of the
                        government it labored through four years of bloody war to overthrow. On the
                        other hand, where we find a man who loves his nation because of its
                        vindication of Freedom and Justice, and would make its appalling sacrifices
                        lead it to higher and holier duties, we have one who would give success to
                        the Union party as the only hope of the perpetuity of the honor and peace of
                        the Republic.</p>
                    <p>The issues are distinctly made. Gen. Geary and Heister Clymer are the
                        representative men who are to give success to treachery or to loyalty. Let
                        the people choose between them!</p>

<b>An Important Case</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In several election districts in Franklin county, deserters were barred
                    from voting by Union party officials in the last election, as called for by
                    Pennsylvania's disfranchisement law. Despite the existence of the law, the
                    editorial complains, enforcement was irregular at best. In Union strongholds
                    deserters were prevented from voting, but such was not the case in areas where
                    Democrats control the local political machinery, an inconsistency that
                    undermines the state's democratic traditions. Consequently, the editors express
                    the hope that the civil suits now pending will reach the state supreme court so
                    that the issue can be resolved once and for all.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In a portion of the election districts in this county--where the Union men
                        had control of the election boards--deserters were disfranchised last fall,
                        in obedience to the act of Congress, and in the Democratic districts they
                        were invariably allowed to vote in defiance of the law. Three civil suits
                        were brought after he election by deserters against election officers in
                        Warren, Hamilton and Fannettsburg, for damages for rejecting such votes, and
                        two of them will probably be for trial in August.</p>
                    <p>In view of the fact that the act of Congress disfranchising deserters is
                        universally disregarded by Democratic election boards, and is universally
                        enforced by Union boards, it is certainly of the first moment to the people
                        to have the question judicially determined. In this county, for instance,
                        deserters vote in Guilford at one window of the court house, and they do not
                        vote at the next window where the votes of the North Ward are received, and
                        like disregard of the law is manifested in nearly half the districts of the
                        State. This fact, considered in connexion with the passage of a bill by the
                        legislature providing more fully for the disfranchisement of deserters,
                        which has not yet been acted on by the Governor, renders it vital that there
                        should be a decision of the question by the court of last resort at an early
                        day, which all parties would be bound to respect. Of course if the act of
                        Congress cannot be sustained by the courts, no State legislation based on
                        the act of Congress, could be sustained; so that if the confessedly just
                        penalty for desertion imposed by Congress is to be enforced in all sections,
                        the validity of the national act must be judicially ascertained. Other grave
                        questions have arisen under the act of Congress which have been adjudged
                        differently by different courts in the State. In strong Democratic districts
                        Union judges have enforced the law at great peril to their person and
                        property. In some of the courts of the State, where suits have been brought
                        for damages, they have been blameless, but in others they have been made
                        liable for costs and in some instances for damages. As no legislation can
                        remedy these growing evils, which are steadily teaching disregard of law, we
                        trust that the whole issue will soon be determined and the duties of courts
                        and election officers under the law so clearly defined that none can err and
                        be excused or justified.</p>
                    <p>A case from Hamilton township in this county is about to be carried to the
                        Supreme Court this spring that will most likely determine all the disputed
                        questions under the act of Congress disfranchising deserters. Mr. Huber was
                        one of the election board of that township last fall, and decided to reject
                        the vote of Mr. Riley because he was a deserter. The facts in the case are
                        not disputed. It is admitted that Mr. Riley was a resident of the township,
                        that he was over twenty and under forty-five, that he was able-bodied and
                        fit for military service, that he was properly enrolled and drafted, and
                        that he refused to report. Instead of entering the army, as all good
                        citizens were bound to do when thus called upon, he fled from his home and
                        remained away until he could return with safety. By consent of counsel a
                        case-stated was submitted to the court of common pleas, admitting the facts
                        as before recited, and asking judgement for defendant if Riley was legally
                        disfranchised by the act of Congress, and judgement for one dollar and costs
                        for plaintiff if he was legally entitled to vote. The court held that he was
                        not legally disfranchised, and directed judgement for the plaintiff for one
                        dollar and costs. The case will be carried to the Supreme Court this month,
                        and will be argued in support of the act of Congress by J. McDowell Sharpe
                        and McLellan &amp; Kimmell. The question of the power of Congress to
                        disfranchise citizens of the States as a penalty for desertion by the
                        records of the Provost Marshal of the districts will be squarely before the
                        court, and the law will, we trust, be so clearly defined that all men will
                        be bound to respect it. We presume that the action of Gov. Curtin on the act
                        of the legislature now in his hands, will be governed by the decision of the
                        Supreme Court.</p>

                        To the Editors of the Franklin Repository:
                    </p>
                    <p>Will you allow me space in your columns to say a few words in regard to the
                        organization of a Soldiers League in our county? In almost every county and
                        city of our State, and not of our own State only, but of all the States
                        whose citizens went out to crush the rebellion, they have such Leagues. They
                        are not intended to be political organizations, but for the purpose of
                        aiding and assisting each other. As we stood by each other at Fredericksburg
                        and Shiloh, at Gettysburg and Vicksburg, with Grant in Virginia or with
                        Sherman from the Mississippi to the sea, so we should stand by each other
                        now. "Every soldier is a brother," was an oft repeated proverb--let us be as
                        much of brothers at home as in the field.</p>
                    <p>It would be no hard matter to organize such a League in the county, if some
                        of our most influential citizens, who were prominent soldiers, would take
                        the matter in hand. A charter could easily be got from the parent League in
                        Philadelphia. Hundreds of Franklin county soldiers would join a League, so
                        as to keep up old associations and friendships whilst in the army. Will not
                        Col. Stumbaugh, or Col. Elder, or Col. Dixon, or Col. Rowe, or Col. Ritchie,
                        or some other of our soldiers take the matter in hand?</p>
                    <p>Let us by all means have a League. If none of those mentioned will take up
                        the business, there are many others to work at it. Start the ball, and like
                        an Alpine avalanche, it will then go of itself. Hoping to hear more of the
                        matter from others, I am<br> A SOLDIER.</p>
