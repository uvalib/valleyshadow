                <transcript>
                    <p>Congress did well to decide on the first day of the session that the States
                        lately in rebellion could not claim representation as a matter of right and
                        that the credentials of their members elect could not go to the committee on
                        elections. It was a wise, a necessary step, to arrest the growing sentiment
                        in the dominions of treason, that the crime of causeless rebellion was to be
                        without atonement or penalty.</p>
                    <p>But there are other duties of the gravest character devolving upon the
                        faithful members of Congress. It will not do to rest with the declaration
                        that the rebel representatives shall not be admitted. That is but the
                        negative part of the duty--the positive remains to be performed, and it is
                        to this task we would urge the early action of Congress.</p>
                    <p>The rebel States cannot long be denied admission, unless they shall willfully
                        refuse to accept just conditions. All agree that there must be exactions or
                        conditions precedent to the return of the rebellious States to full
                        fellowship in the Union. The President and Mr. Stevens may differ as to the
                        extent of these demands; but while conflicting theories are advanced as to
                        the status of these States, the practical solution of the question brings
                        all to a common centre.</p>
                    <p>In most of the rebel States provisional governments have been supplanted by
                        Executives and legislatures chosen by the people, in pursuance of the
                        President's assumption of supreme power in regulating a conquered people,
                        and all the functions of local government are performed. Courts have been
                        re-established; municipal and county officers have been qualified, and mail
                        communication has been resumed, or soon will be, with every section of the
                        rebellious territory. They have chosen Congressmen and Senators, and they
                        are now at the doors of Congress. When and how shall they be admitted?</p>
                    <p>Their admission is but a question of weeks or months. Let no true man mistake
                        the signs of the times. They mark the future too plainly for intelligence to
                        err. The rejection of the members from the rebel States cannot be
                        indefinite. It can now be done, and--what is more important still--it can be
                        maintained if the loyal members of Congress will unite on a just platform,
                        adopt the measures necessary to give it complete success, and then leave the
                        issue with the southern people. But if Congress shall merely recognize the
                        unfitness of southern representation without defining the atonement and
                        guarantees to be given by treason, depend upon it, the right will lose in
                        the struggle.</p>
                    <p>Reconstruction is now clearly in the hands of the true men in Congress, but
                        let them not waste their power by divisions or weaken their cause by
                        needless delay. Treason is untiring, and its means are neither few nor
                        feeble. It could not be better served than for Congress to procrastinate. It
                        would triumph on its own terms over unreasonable delay, as surely as it has
                        failed in its bloody war to overthrow the government it now seeks to
                        administer. Let the patriotic men of Congress be wise and consider; let them
                        make common cause and act with unity and fidelity.</p>
                    <p>We do not assume to define the guarantees and the atonement to be demanded
                        from the men whose hands are still stained with the blood of our brethren,
                        and who come defiant and unrepentant to the doors of Congress; but it is for
                        the loyal men who have been charged with this solemn trust, to perform it
                        without fear or favor. They differ as to what conditions shall be accepted;
                        but their differences must cease, or their cause will be lost. The lives of
                        three hundred thousand heroic martyrs will have been sacrificed in vain, and
                        the Freedom we boast as our crowning victory, will be blotted again as it is
                        handed over to the cruel embrace of its deadly foes.</p>
                    <p>We appeal to the faithful men in Congress to accept some common ground upon
                        which they can unite, and in behalf of which they can appeal to their
                        country and to their God. Just as may seem the enfranchisement of the
                        emancipated slave, we prefer to see him secure in his person, his property,
                        his labor, his household and his equal rights before the law, to endanger
                        his re-enslavement, more abject than before, by the triumph of Wrong over
                        the distracted counsels of Right. Clearly as justice may demand the
                        confiscation of rebel property to make restitution for the desolation and
                        debt it has imposed upon the loyal people, we prefer to surrender it rather
                        than see treason regain power unrestrained, and repudiate our national debt,
                        or destroy our credit by the assumption of the debt incurred in fruitless
                        effort to overthrow the Republic by the sword.</p>
                    <p>These are no idle fears. If the true men in Congress fail to harmonize in the
                        work of re-construction, it will be accomplished by the foes of Freedom, and
                        they will perfect it with fearful consistency. One by one their members or
                        their States will gain admission, and when once they triumph it will be the
                        end of loyal rule. The freedmen will be enslaved again without even the poor
                        compensations of slavery, our National credit will belong to history, and
                        the fruits of our bloody sacrifices will be laid at the feet of the
                        vanquished by the victors.</p>
                    <p>The time for action is now! Let those who doubt it turn to the teachings of
                        the few brief weeks of the session. How many have fallen? How many more are
                        faint and feeble? Raymond ran well but a day--others reached the shadow of a
                        season. He voted that the rebellious States were without rights as States,
                        denied his record before his country knew it, and now would mock a bereaved
                        nation with "glittering generalities," miscalled "exactions," and bid the
                        traitors welcome to full power and fellowship--to consummate by faithless
                        statesmanship what they lost by the sword. He has followers, and will have
                        more. Doolittle responds from the Senate, and Cowan, of ill-fated
                        Pennsylvania, answers that treason shall regain its potency unwashed of its
                        wanton blood, and unshorn of its appalling perfidy.</p>
                    <p>Let there be union of true hearts for the sake of the Union. Let there be
                        conditions and guarantees accepted by all, even at some sacrifice if need
                        be, rather than peril all involved in the struggle. There are amendments to
                        the constitution which, unless passed by Congress and their adoption
                        enforced as a condition precedent to admission, will leave all the
                        legitimate fruits of the war at the mercy of traitors. Define the paramount
                        duty of States and citizens to the national authority; forbid the payment of
                        debt incurred in rebellion against the government; enforce equal rights for
                        all before the law; demand a just basis of representation; make the organic
                        law protect the national faith with its creditors, and then define, by
                        enactment, the clemency of the nation, with fixed limitations. The issue
                        would then rest with traitors--the Executive and the loyal people could not
                        but sustain Congress, and the contest would be over. All that should be
                        realized as the results of the war might not be attained; but the present
                        would bid us to a hopeful future, and all would in time be well for the
                        Republic!</p>

                <summary>The article commends Congress's decision to deny the southern states
                    representation in the current session as a "wise" and "necessary step, to arrest
                    the growing sentiment" in the South that "the crime of causeless rebellion was
                    to be without atonement or penalty." Yet, it notes the absolute necessity of

                    <p>The tone of the leading press of the State in response to the memorial of the
                        people of Chambersburg to the legislature, for partial relief from the utter
                        destruction caused by McCausland's vandalism on the 30th of July, 1864, is
                        most gratifying to our long-suffering citizens. A number of the leading
                        journals of the State, which earnestly resisted any legislative relief while
                        the war was still in progress, have spoken out with great positiveness
                        asking the legislature to deal generously with Chambersburg. Last year most
                        persons insisted that the resources of the State must be husbanded for the
                        terrible struggle with treason, and others felt that however just indemnity
                        might be considered, there was the possibility of the destruction of
                        additional millions, to assume which would destroy the credit of the State;
                        but now the black, desolating cloud of war has passed away, and all seem to
                        recognize the justice of lending a helping hand to the few people of
                        Chambersburg upon whom the fullest measure of rebel vengeance fell. They are
                        unwilling to see our town singled out from the many in a great and
                        prosperous commonwealth, and sacked and laid in ashes by rebel vandalism,
                        without extending some relief to those who have thus been rendered homeless
                        and bankrupt.</p>
                    <p>Chambersburg does not ask to be indemnified. In addition to the overwhelming
                        destruction that fell to their hard lot on the 30th of July, 1864, they have
                        suffered in common with all the other citizens of the border by raids and
                        invasion and their inevitable spoliations; but they do appeal to the
                        generosity and justice of their fellow-citizens of the State, for a helping
                        hand to enable them in time, by frugality and industry, to recover
                        measurably from the crushing blow. They bore it for all the loyal people of
                        the State. The vandalism that made the flames kiss each other over our happy
                        homes, was aimed at the whole North for its fidelity in maintaining our
                        Nationality; but the few upon whom it fell were prostrated by the stroke.
                        Their homes were made hideous, blackened walls to strike terror into a free
                        people struggling for the right; but over their shapeless ruins they
                        maintained the great common cause until victory was made complete by the
                        valor of all actions of the State and country. Their sons and fathers have
                        been upon almost every battle-field; they have met all the demands of an
                        imperiled government; they have the same bereaved and broken circles which
                        are common to all, and in addition, they have received treason's most
                        barbarous and destructive blow, leaving naught but desolation and poverty as
                        its fruits. It is gratifying, indeed, in the midst of our ruins to hear the
                        kind words of generous journals and legislators, and we have abiding faith
                        that the legislature will respond to the appeal in a generous manner.</p>

                <summary>It is reported that David McConaughy presented a petition to the
                    legislature contesting his defeat in the recent state senate election.
                    McConaughy alleges that his opponent, C. M. Duncan, triumphed in the contest
                    because votes from deserters were illegally included in the final tally.</summary>
