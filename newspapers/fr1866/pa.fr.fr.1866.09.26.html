<b>A. J. "I," "Me," "My."! Gems of Johnsonism!</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Armed with extracts from speeches delivered by President Johnson over the
                    course of his trip to Chicago as evidence, the article highlights his opposition
                    to the plight of the freedmen and his support of the men who perpetrated the New
                    Orleans Massacre.<br>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 8)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article contains a dispatch from John T. Monroe, Mayor of New Orleans,
                    to President Johnson. In his correspondence, Monroe advocates removing Gen.
                    Sheridan from his command, and re-asserts his desire to have the American flag
                    taken down because local residents feel it is "obnoxious," a step that would "be
                    flattering to the popular heart." The flag's display, he intimates, was as much
                    a cause of the recent massacre as was the "complexion of the assemblage" that
                    had gathered to convene the scheduled constitutional convention.<br>

                    "thanks" for the "courtesy" of the butchers of the loyalists of the Southwestern
                    metropolis. As the existence of a friendly correspondence between these two
                    distinguished dignitaries is thus conceded, the probabilities are increased that
                    the following letter, picked up at the railroad depot in Springfield, Ill., on

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The nation was not surprised when Andrew Johnson, under the inspiration of
                        St. Louis beverages and flaunting rebel flags, announced in his speech that
                        he would "kick out" Lincoln's office-holders, and followed it with the still
                        more disgraceful declaration: "I will kick them out as fast as I can!" The
                        faithful people of the country were fully prepared for his ostracism of
                        every honest officer, and they welcome the fulfillment of his threat made in
                        mingled ribaldry and blasphemy to the rebels of St. Louis.</p>
                    <p>We feared that he might have discretion enough, under the advice of some sage
                        advisers, to postpone his kicking out process until after the election; but
                        his madness has ruled over all, and the work of decapitation progresses as
                        rapidly as commissions can be issued by the several departments. Mr. Scull,
                        of the Somerset Herald, and Mr. Harper of the
                        Adams Sentinel, and Mr. Deal, our Post Master,
                        have been honored by their removal by the ruling debauchery of Andrew
                        Johnson, and Hon. Alex. H. Coffroth, late M. C., succeeds Mr. Harper as
                        Assessor, and Rufus C. Swope, of Adams, succeeds Mr. Scull as Collector of
                        this district.</p>
                    <p>These appointments are fully in character with the degrading policy and the
                        corrupt purposes of the President and his varied followers. Gen. Coffroth is
                        bankrupt in politics and incompetent to earn a livelihood at his profession.
                        He managed a palpable fraud to crawl into Congress for a few months, and
                        thus pilfer several thousand dollars from the government for services in a
                        position which all parties in the House finally admitted he had not been
                        elected to, and now, that he has been rejected by Congress and rejected by
                        his party at home, he has to be cared for. He is therefore pensioned upon
                        the people in the most important office to them in the State. A man without
                        business qualifications or moral fitness for any responsible trust, is made
                        the arbiter of the taxes to be imposed upon the people of the district, and
                        it is not doubted that he will use his official power unscrupulously for the
                        attainment of the political ends of his masters, regardless of justice or
                        the interests of the government. It is a shame and an insult to the
                        intelligence and business interests of our people, to appoint such an
                        officer to control their taxes, and it must react fearfully upon the
                        abandoned rulers who have assented to it. Surely this Congressional district
                        could have furnished some reputable and well qualified Democrat to fill the
                        place, and for an office so important to the people, they had a right to
                        expect some regard to fitness and qualifications in the work of political
                        corruption by public patronage. Fortunately for the district, Gen. Coffroth
                        is well known in Washington and he will of course be rejected by the Senate
                        on the ground of unfitness.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Swope, the new Collector, was a follower of the army, as he now follows
                        political power to forage upon it. He was a quarter-master and learned the
                        science of profiting by the thrift that follows fawning. He was once a
                        Republican, and would be so to-day if it would pay best so to think and
                        vote; but as integrity in politics just now has no reward but an approving
                        conscience and the blessings of a loyal people, he prefers the cash to all
                        other compensations, and therefore swings around the political circle and
                        accepts the situation. We presume that the Senate will reject Coffroth for
                        being a fool--just what he can't help; but it will most likely reject Swope
                        for corruptly bartering his principles and his country for the emoluments
                        which perfidy has placed in the hands of his country's foes. It is some
                        consolation to upright men to know that when Mr. Swope shall have been
                        rejected by the Senate, the President will then fulfil his bond to the
                        Democracy and appoint a full fledged Democrat in his place. The Senate will
                        doubtless confirm all such appointments if they bear any semblance to
                        fitness, for Democratic aspirants sacrifice no honor, no manhood, no
                        principle in accepting office under Andrew Johnson; but the Senate owes it
                        to the nation and to the purity of the administration of the government, to
                        reject all men who come before it with their price stamped indelibly upon
                        their foreheads.</p>
                    <p>Andrew Johnson has openly espoused the cause of the Democracy of the North
                        and of the Traitors of the South, and his patronage belongs to those who
                        honestly share his convictions and approve his policy. Whenever he shall
                        cease his degrading and futile efforts to debauch men by his plunder, and
                        appoint reputable and consistent Democrats to fill his offices, they will be
                        entitled to confirmation and will doubtless be confirmed; but the Senate
                        will never be a party to the policy of the corruptionists who auction their
                        officer from door to door, appealing to the cupidity and ambition of men to
                        make them faithless to their principles and faithless to the Republic. If
                        honors thus won and thus briefly to be worn by Coffroth and Swope afford
                        them any gratification, we can assure them that there are few who could envy
                        them their success. They will be sadder and it may be wiser men by and
                    by!</p>

<b>Inciting Riots</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article reproaches those individuals responsible for the violence that
                    occurred during the Republican meeting at Mr. Sellers's public house on
                    September 17th. Regardless of whom is to blame for the melee, it charges, such
                    actions are "lawless and riotous, and as such should be condemned by all
                    law-abiding people and punishable by law." Should the perpetrators not be
                    brought to justice, such inaction will serve as "encouragement to bad men to
                    glut their lawless appetites." The piece also castigates the Valley Spirit for
                    its role in inciting the disorder.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>This journal has never countenanced disorder or lawlessness of any kind, nor
                        has it ever excused turbulence on partizan grounds. The proceedings about
                        the public house of Mr. Sellers on the evening of the 17th, when the
                        Republican meeting was held in front of the court house, were disgraceful in
                        the extreme, and no good citizen of either party can justify or in any
                        measure excuse it. We have heard various conflicting stories, each party
                        criminating the other, but whoever may have been guilty of the provocation,
                        the assault upon the house and person of Mr. Sellers was lawless and
                        riotous, and as such should be condemned by all law-abiding people and
                        punished by the law. To charge that one party or the other was wholly in the
                        wrong, is to espouse the cause of lawlessness, and we cannot do it; but
                        equally fallacious is the ever ready excuse for disorder that "the other
                        party was guilty too." We trust that as a matter of justice to law-breakers
                        and law- observers, and for the future peace, order and credit of
                        Chambersburg, every man concerned in the disorder may be arrested and the
                        guilt of the guilty and the innocence of the innocent established, and that
                        just punishment will follow the guilty. If this be done, we shall have order
                        at all public gatherings hereafter. If it is not done, and both parties
                        shield and excuse the guilty because of their political faith, there is
                        every encouragement to bad men to glut their lawless appetites.</p>
                    <p>It was not necessary for this journal to say so much by way of defining its
                        position, but we have deemed it proper to reiterate our well known views
                        because of the lawless teachings of the Spirit.
                        Speaking of the disorder referred to, it says:</p>
                    <p>"If no other remedy will cure these outlaws, they will inscribe on our
                        banners, 'an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth'--and house for house. Property holders take warning. A word to
                        the wise is sufficient!"</p>
                    <p>It was just the malicious and fiendish spirit that pervades the foregoing
                        extract that made all the disorder we have had, and there is not a lawless
                        rascal in the county who will not thank the Spirit for inviting him to the destruction of property on any
                        trivial pretext he may choose to invent. By such declarations the Spirit invites violence, and offers a premium to
                        every rowdy in the land to excel in the gratification of his low and wicked
                        instincts. Suppose the Spirit should carry out
                        its doctrine to a logical conclusion. It needs but one rowdy to commence the
                        work, and he is cordially invited to it by that journal. Once commenced each
                        thief and vagabond is himself the judge of what would be "an eye for an eye
                        and a tooth for a tooth, and a house for a house." Rowdy Smith hides in some
                        alley and flings a stone into the Spirit office.
                        He believes in the Spirit's politics, but he
                        wants a row and a chance for revenge or plunder, and he starts the disorder
                        to have it blamed on the other party, so that the work of retaliation--the
                        "house for a house"--shall begin as the Spirit
                        demands. The amusement of a "house for a house" would go on swimmingly for a
                        time, but by and by the proprietors of the Spirit
                        and many of their friends might begin to consider that for all this
                        destruction they must pay their full share to replace it dollar for dollar,
                        and the result would most likely be that while the law would restore every
                        other man's property, it would justly declare that as the Spirit invoked the riot, and demanded the
                        destruction of property, its proprietors must be satisfied with the fruits
                        of their own acts. Should the rowdies of Chambersburg obey the rowdy counsel
                        of the Spirit, and destroy property, the
                        publishers of the Spirit would be just as guilty
                        both morally and legally, as the braver rowdies who might lead in the work
                        of destruction.</p>
                    <p>Let the Spirit cease its devotion to lawlessness,
                        and join all good citizens in demanding that there shall be prompt,
                        impartial, and severe justice meted out to all lawless men, and it will soon
                        cease; but if there shall not be lawlessness hereafter it must be because
                        the riotous counsels of the Spirit have been
                        disregarded by those who love disorder. We do not fear lawlessness for the
                        reason that, outside of a few men of both parties who follow the Spirit's follies, the people of Chambersburg
                        without regard to party, feel themselves dishonored whenever a meeting of

                    when united with all the members elected by the rebel States, the President
                    would recognize the Northern Democrats and Southern rebels as the Congress of
