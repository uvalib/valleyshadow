<b>Geary on Bounties</b><br> (Column 7)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article contains a letter from Gen. Geary to Henry Wilson, the chairman
                    of the Military Committee, in which the Union candidate for governor articulates
                    his position on granting bounties to returning soldiers. In his letter, Geary
                    calls for the government to provide "something more substantial than mere thanks
                    and gratitude" for the "sterling rank and file" soldiers who braved the "deadly
                    strife" and sustained the "glory and honor of the Republic." These men, he
                    contends, deserve to be rewarded for their efforts regardless of the impact on
                    the nation's economy, for if not for their sacrifices there would be no country.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>
                        To the Loyal Unionists of the South!
                    </p>
                    <p>The great issue is upon us. The majority in Congress, and its supporters,
                        firmly declare that "the rights of the citizens enumerated in the
                        Constitution, and established by the supreme law, must be maintained
                        inviolate."</p>
                    <p>Rebels and rebel sympathizers assert that "the rights of the citizens must be
                        left to the States alone, and under such regulations as the respective
                        States choose voluntarily to prescribe."</p>
                    <p>We have seen this doctrine of State sovereignty carried out in its practical
                        results until all authority in Congress was denied, the Union temporarily
                        destroyed, the constitutional rights of the citizens of the South nearly
                        annihilated, and the land desolated by civil war.</p>
                    <p>The time has come when the restricture of Southern State government must be
                        laid on constitutional principles or the despotism grown up under an
                        atrocious leadership be permitted to remain. We know of no other plan than
                        that Congress, under its constitutional powers, shall now exercise its
                        authority to establish the principles whereby protection is made
                        co-extensive with citizenship.</p>
                    <p>We maintain that no State, either by its organic law or legislation, can make
                        transgression on the rights of the citizen legitimate.</p>
                    <p>We demand, and ask you to concur in demanding, protection to every citizen of
                        this great Republic on the basis of equality before the law; and further,
                        that no State government would be recognized as legitimate under the
                        Constitution, so far as it does not, by its organic law, make impartial
                        protection full and complete.</p>
                    <p>Under the doctrine of "State sovereignty" with rebels in the foreground
                        controlling Southern Legislatures, and embittered by disappointment in their
                        schemes to destroy the Union, there will be no safety for the loyal element
                        of the South. Our reliance for protection is now in Congress, and the great
                        Union party that has stood and is standing by the nationality, by the
                        constitutional rights and by the beneficent principles of free government.</p>
                    <p>For the purpose of bringing the loyal Unionists of the South into conjunctive
                        action with the true friends of republican government in the North, we
                        invite you to send delegates in goodly numbers from all the Southern States,
                        including Missouri, Kentucky, West Virginia, Maryland and Delaware, to meet
                        at Independence Hall, in the city of Philadelphia, on the first Monday of
                        September next.</p>
                    <p>It is proposed that we should meet at that time to recommend measures for the
                        establishment of such government in the South as accords with and protects
                        the rights of all citizens. We trust this call will be responded to by a
                        numerous delegation of such as represent the true loyalty of the South. That
                        kind of government which gives full protection to all the rights of the
                        citizen, such as our fathers intended, we claim as our birthright. Either
                        the lovers of constitutional liberty must rule the nation, or rebels and
                        their sympathizers be permitted to misrule it.</p>
                    <p>Shall loyalty or disloyalty have the keeping of the destinies of the nation?
                        Let the responses to this call, which is now in circulation for signatures,
                        and is being numerously signed, answer.</p>

                    Although the blaze caused considerable damage to the floor and roof of the
                    garret, its impact could have been far graver if not for the efforts of the
                    local fire companies, which managed to extinguish the fire before it could
                    spread to the surrounding property. The Directors of the bank have offered a
