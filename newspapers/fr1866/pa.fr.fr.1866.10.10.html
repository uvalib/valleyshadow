<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A friend, who is one of the most ardent of politicians, insists upon it that
                        the American people devote themselves too much to politics; and that the
                        frequency of our elections is disadvantageous to the general good, as
                        keeping up constantly political excitement. He maintains that literature,
                        science, art, and all callings even to the humblest, are discouraged by the
                        absorption of the public mind into this whirlpool. The student and the
                        artist, he alleges, are allured from their severe studies, by the renown
                        more easily won on the hustings and the editorial chair; and that the
                        temptations of official emoluments promise an easier road to affluence than
                        the laborious pursuit of ordinary business. With great gravity and
                        earnestness, he asserts that politics conduce to indolence, superficialness
                        of character and attainments--giving us up to light reading and light
                        thinking, and diverting our minds from weightier contemplations. Then he has
                        a whirlwind of denunciations to launch upon the corruptions, the falsehoods,
                        the abusiveness, the follies, the clap-trap, the pyrotechnics, the
                        bon-fires, the humbuggery in general that he says characterizes
                        electioneering campaigns. So that we, sometimes, feel as if he would retire
                        to his counter, and leave the ballot-box to the care of the boys who want
                        the offices.</p>
                    <p>There is much truth, but more error in our friend's philosophy. In a
                        government of the people, the people must be interested in the choice of
                        rulers, the development of correct principles and their maintenance; and
                        this interest begets zeal, controversy, efforts to inform and persuade, and
                        naturally all the appliances and machinery that we are so familiar with in
                        seasons of electioneering. The masses become educated in the great duty of
                        managing their government, grow familiarized with the institutions of the
                        country and the details of their administration, learn the character and
                        ability of their statesmen, and fit themselves for the discharge of
                        functions which they themselves are so often called upon to assume. That
                        many bright minds are diverted from the pursuit of the purer and more
                        distinctive paths of literature, science and art, may be true; but the
                        history of our own nation, and eminently that of Great Britain, happily
                        supplies us with illustrious instances of statesmen who ranked as high in
                        the republic of letters, as in the arts of diplomacy and the arena of the
                        mere politician.</p>
                    <p>The excitement of political canvassing gives a direction to the enthusiasm of
                        our people, that otherwise might burst out in reprehensible indulgences and
                        pastimes; and, we find, in fact, our population less given to wild and
                        brutal sports than any other population in the world. The objectionable
                        features in our canvassing will pass away with the increasing enlightenment
                        of the masses; and we reasonably hope for the day, when buffoonery,
                        falsehood, and villainy will find no favor, but will give place to argument,
                        honest attempts at conviction, and conscientious appeals to the sense of
                        right dwelling in the bosom of all men. That this is not the case
                        now-a-days, is owing to the nefarious tactics of our adversaries, whose
                        record is so shameful and guilty, that they are driven to misrepresentation,
                        shufflings, false pretences, and miserable appeals to prejudices and
                        passions, to divert the public mind from their faithlessness, and to steal
                        into power in disguise. Were they to come forth unveiled, their
                        fellow-citizens would start indignant and hoot them into obscurity.</p>
                    <p>One of the surest means of elevating the character of our elections, is to
                        bring the sober-minded, intelligent and most interested of our community
                        into the opening movements of the campaign--into the primary meetings, into
                        the conventions. To see to it that the men whom we select for our candidates
                        and representatives are worthy, and honest, and honorable--that no mere
                        office-seekers or pensioners on the public purse shall monopolize the public
                        patronage, but that peculiar fitness in men shall commend them to the choice
                        of their neighbors. It is gratifying to find that there is a growing
                        tendency to this course among us; and it is with high pride that we can
                        point to the many excellent gentlemen, whose names were presented by our
                        party for the suffrage of the county and district. It should be our
                        inviolable rule that no improper person shall be placed upon our ticket. And
                        while we have reason to be proud of the men we nominated in this canvass,
                        and the principles we advocated, it is with no less pride that we
                        contemplate the honorable manner in which we conducted the contest. We met
                        the issues involved boldly and frankly and faithfully. We presented the
                        truth openly, and urged its acceptance decently. We did not descend into the
                        sloughs of calumny and scandalize our opponents in remote districts, when we
                        felt safe in their absence. We did not stimulate the jealousies, and envies,
                        and unbecoming prejudices, and awaken the animosities that are found
                        slumbering in too many hearts. We did not go forth with an armamentary of
                        falsehoods to blind and bewilder the voter, and mislead him into wrong; nor
                        with a cornucopia of offices to tempt the avaricious, and with the promises
                        of petty appointments to purchase the manhood and conscience of electors
                        whom we meant to cheat. Nay, we did not go with the wicked suggestions that
                        it would in other ways be to the interest of men to betray themselves and
                        their party, and with money and produce offer to buy needy men as one would
                        buy flesh in the open shambles.</p>
                    <p>We went before the people with the principles they had often times
                        endorsed--with the cause they had given so much blood and treasure to
                        sustain; with banners bearing their own chosen mottoes, and held up
                        exultantly by their own gallant sons and brothers. We asked them to be
                        faithful to themselves; we asked them to be faithful to the men who had been
                        faithful to them and been faithful to their country; and again to set their
                        seal of condemnation upon the party which had been faithless to the people
                        and false to the country.</p>
                    <p>THE Spirit departs from the truth when it says
                        that we "made a most malicious and wanton attack on Mr. Matthew P. Welsh,
                        the newly appointed Post Master." We did no such thing. We stated that he
                        was the only Republican in Chambersburg who was willing to accept the Post
                        office as his price for his principles, and we say so still. If there were
                        others we would be glad to know their names. Democratic rumor, which
                        embraced all in its sweep who could be even suspected of perfidy to their
                        convictions, did not profess to have any other Republicans willing to accept
                        it. We know, also, of half a score of Republicans to whom it was offered by
                        the men who hawked Johnson's plunder from door to door to buy votes, and
                        none but Mr. Welsh would entertain the proposition. He accepted the price
                        and doubtless voted the Democratic ticket yesterday as the consideration.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Welsh had a perfect right to vote the Democratic ticket, in accordance
                        with his own convictions; but when the office he has accepted was offered
                        from man to man as the price for a vote, and he thus accepted it, he must
                        bring upon himself the contempt of all upright men, and cannot hope to
                        escape the signal reprobation of the Senate, which has an equal voice with
                        the President in filling the place. He will of course be rejected, and as
                        the election is now over, there will be a score of full-fledged Democrats
                        clamorous for the place, and Mr. Welsh will be kicked out as unceremoniously
                        by the Democrats as he will by the Senate. No men know this fact better than
                        the publishers of the Spirit, and they will join
                        the Democrats in their universal chuckle over Mr. Welsh when they find him
                        rejected and the place open for a full blooded Democrat. We assure them in
                        advance that they do not miscalculate in the matter of Mr. Welsh's
                        rejection, and we assure Mr. Welsh also that we do not miscalculate as to a
                        Democrat succeeding him. If he likes the market to which he has taken his
                        wares, we certainly don't complain, and as the Democrats are certain of the
                        oyster while Mr. Welsh gets the shell, they certainly need not complain. If
                        in the end Mr. Welsh don't complain, everybody will be jolly!</p>

                    <p>The New York Tribune publishes a full report of
                        the military Commission appointed to investigate the New Orleans massacre,
                        and the causes leading thereto. This Commission consisted of Maj. Gen.
                        Joseph A. Moyer, Brig. Gen. S. M. Quincy, and Brig. Gen. Irwin Gregg. A full
                        examination of all persons supposed capable of throwing light upon the
                        matter was made, and after sifting all the testimony the Commissioners came
                        unanimously to the conclusion that the Administration at Washington is
                        responsible for the atrocity; that it was planned by the supporters of the
                        President's Policy; that three-fourths of the police were ex-rebel leaders;
                        that firemen were seen acting as and with the police, making arrests as
                        special police, and lending the assistance of their iron wrenches in the
                        congenial occupation of dispatching the wounded, that the alarm bell was
                        rung as a signal for general attack; that the signal was not the regular
                        fire-alarm; but was recognized throughout the city as indicating that the
                        attack had commenced; and as a call to arms of all who might desire to
                        participate therein. "Look out for work now," was the cry in the streets as
                        the first strokes of the bell sounded. The assassins were organized
                        militarily, and such expressions were heard as "There goes Hay's brigade;"
                        "Damn you, you are fighting Hay's brigade;" "Is all Hay's brigade up?" "No;
                        if it had been, not one of you would have escaped."</p>
                    <p>After detailing the scenes of the massacre the Commission go on to call
                        attention to the "brutal treatment, and almost inhuman neglect of wounded
                        and dead prisoners at the various stations, before they were, by military
                        orders, removed to the military hospitals."</p>
                    <p>In conclusion several results are arrived at, as follows:</p>
                    <p>1. "The Board will state it as their firm conviction, that but for the declaration of martial law, and the presence
                            of the troops, fire and bloodshed would have raged throughout the night
                            in all negro quarters of the city, and that the lives and property of
                            Unionists and Northern men would have been at the mercy of the mob. The
                            Conservators of the peace being for the time, the instigators of
                            violence, nothing would have remained but in arming for self defence,
                            and a scene might have ensued unparalleled in the history of the
                        age. As in the Gordon riots in London, and the more recent draft
                        riots in New York, the affair would have passed beyond the power of the
                        originators, into the hands of that class whose only object would have been
                        plunder and destruction irrespective of party. In the Board's opinion, the
                        property of the Southern merchant not less than the life of the negro and
                        the Unionists, was that night under the protection of the Federal bayonet
                        alone."</p>
                    <p>2. "The Board would state that, in their opinion, the whole drift and current
                        of the evidence tends irresistibly to the conclusion that there was among
                        the class of violence known to exist in this city and among the members of
                        the ex-Confederate associations before alluded to, a
                            pre-concerted plan and purpose of attack upon this Convention, provided
                            any plausible pretext therefore could be found. Threats to members to
                            "prepare their coffins," warnings to friends to keep clear of the
                        vicinity, anonymous letters dissuading those whose purpose to be present was
                        known, all these taken together, the Board regard as of a significance which
                        can hardly be misinterpreted. Though not in evidence, it is within the
                        personal knowledge of the Board that a mock obituary notice of the demise of
                        the Convention on the 30th of July, was some weeks previous posted in this
                        city."</p>
                    <p>3. "Whether, and to what degree, Mayor Monroe can be regarded as an
                        accomplice in, or knowing to this purpose of attack, will, probably, by
                        direct testimony, never appear. Whether any definite instructions were given
                        to the police, the Board regard as immaterial. He knew their feelings
                        towards this party of negro suffrage to be identical with the mob. Three-fourths of them were ex-Confederate soldiers, and at
                            least one of three officers, appointed by himself, a notorious thug,
                            assassin and former leader of the very men of blood who might be
                            expected to be foremost in the attack. Had the police been sent
                        to the hall in advance, with order to preserve the peace, they could have
                        had no excuse for the attack on the Convention; on the contrary, they must
                        have acted in its defence; and this was the advice of Gen. Herron. But if
                        the police are kept away until an attack is made and fighting ensues, then
                        precipitated in mass upon the scene, it is easy to foresee what will be
                        their action in quelling the riot. The Convention and its supporters have
                        been long held up as outlaws, revolutionists and conspirators against the
                        law, and the police would have acted by the order of the Mayor, but for the
                        interference of Gen. Baird. As it is a maxim that a man must be presumed to
                        intend the legitimate consequences of his acts, the Board are reluctantly
                        forced to the conclusion that, although the instance of Lieut. Gov. Voorhees
                        and others were successful in causing the issuing of the Proclamation, yet
                        that Mayor Monroe well knew that before the excited
                            passions of the mob it would be as a barrier of straw to fire: that no
                            troops had been asked for, and without the presence of police, violence
                            was inevitable. When, therefore, he withdrew and massed his armed
                            police, and on the breaking out of the riot, precipitated them upon the
                            scene, the Board are compelled to conclude that he knew what their
                            action would be, and that he intended the inevitable consequences of his
                            own acts."</p>
                    <p>4. "The Board will call attention to the evidence which seems in many
                        instances to indicate clearly the identity of parties guilty of murder.
                            The impossibility of bringing such criminals to
                            justice under the Civil Government as it now exists, would be, in their
                            opinion, universally acknowledged by this community. Reliable
                        evidence would seem to fix the identity of one of the murder of Captain
                        Loup, the ex-United States Officer. The evidence against the notorious
                        Lucien Adams, though direct, is that of negroes. In this connection, the
                        Board would respectfully call attention to the small proportion of the negro
                        testimony taken, and to the fact that all important
                            points regarded as established, rest upon white testimony alone."</p>
                    <p>These results have been reached upon full and careful examination, by
                        commissioners who cannot expect to gain anything from the President by their
                        uprightness and candor, and who may be subjected to humiliations and losses
                        in consequence.</p>
                    <p>In this connection, it should not escape attention that the President, in his
                        speech at the St. Louis banquet, delivered on the 9th of September, entered
                        into a labored defense of the massacre, casting all the blame upon the
                        innocent victims. He distinctly charged that the Conventionists were
                        revolutionary and criminal, and were inspired by the radical portion of
                        Congress, and that hence, all measures of repression resorted to were
                        allowable. This speech, to thoughtful men, furnished strong corroborative
                        evidence of the complicity of the President in the stupendous crime
                    enacted.</p>

                    <p>WASHINGTON, Oct. 4.--The following despatch has just been received from the
                            Tribune Bureau, in New Orleans:</p>
                    <p>NEW ORLEANS, La., Thursday, Oct. 4, 1866.</p>
                    <p>Some important disclosures will soon be officially made public in reference
                        to secret rebel societies, which permeate the entire South. These
                        organizations have branch circles in New York city and the West. That in New
                        York is said to number 50,000, principally composed of men who served in the
                        rebel army. Each circle has a different name. Some are known as "The True
                        Sons of the South," others as "The Knights of Arabia," and all are well
                        armed with the most improved weapons, ready at a moment's notice, should a
                        favorable opportunity arise, to renew the struggle for the lost cause. One
                        of the chief members of this organization, now in prison, is said to have
                        made important disclosures. Gen. Sheridan is concentrating troops in this
                        city for important purposes, which will soon be made apparent.</p>
                    <p>Nine cases of whipping of negroes have been recently officially reported in
                        the parish at Bienville. One old woman, seventy years of age, received 400
                        lashes.</p>
                    <p>The following explains itself:</p>
                    <p>NEW ORLEANS, Sept. 20th, 1866.--To His Excellency,
                            Governor Trockmorton: I have just received from Col. Mason a
                        report on the affair which occurred at Brenham, Texas, on the 7th inst., and
                        have directed him to notify Brevet Major Smith that he must not permit
                        himself nor any of his men to be arrested. I respectfully request of your
                        Excellency to do all in your power to allay the excitement there, and I will
                        do all in my power to satisfy the ends of justice in every case, but I doubt
                        if much justice could be done in a community which compels our officers and
                        soldiers to remain inside of the defence thrown around their camps. I will
                        have an additional and thorough investigation of this affair, if possible,
                        to ascertain if any soldiers were guilty of the affair, but Col. Mason is
                        clearly of the impression that those designated for arrest are innocent.</p>
                    <p>Respectfully, your obedient servant,<br> P. H. SHERIDAN,<br> Major General
                        U. S. A.</p>
