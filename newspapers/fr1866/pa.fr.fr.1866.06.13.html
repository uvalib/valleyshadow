<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Union men of Crawford county have quite an animated and rather bitter
                        contest, so far as the newspapers are concerned, for the nomination for
                        Congress. Until recently we supposed that the struggle, if there shall be a
                        struggle when it reaches the people, would be between Hon. D. A. Finney and
                        Judge Pettis; but from the last Meadville Journal
                        we must infer that the chief editor of this paper is also a candidate in
                        that county, or in danger of being nominated. It devotes a whole page almost
                        exclusively to vituperation of Mr. Finney and Mr. M'Clure, and it certainly
                        is apprehensive that one or perhaps both may be nominated by Crawford
                        county.</p>
                    <p>The paper is manifestly either edited or its articles dictated by Mr. Pettis
                        himself, and as we happened to state in a recent paragraph that he had
                        opposed the re-election of Gov. Curtin in 1863--after Curtin had been made
                        the standard-bearer of the party--and lost an office therefor by the
                        positive direction of President Lincoln, Mr. Pettis attempts to vindicate
                        himself by abusing us. To that line of vindication we have no manner of
                        objection, as we have been used to the follies of fools and the malice of
                        pretenders too long to care for either. Nor do we object to the testimony of
                        Hon. John Covode, who certifies that Mr. Pettis did support Gov. Curtin. As
                        Mr. Covode openly opposed Gov. Curtin's re-election after the Pittsburgh
                        Convention, just as Mr. Pettis did, until he found it unsafe to oppose him
                        any longer, he is probably the most competent witness Mr. Pettis could call.
                        Having both started out wrong, and the one lost an office and the other
                        likely to lose an assortment of political honors which flitted in his
                        dreams, they both counseled with their fears and ambition and voted the
                        ticket. They are therefore the most admirable sort of witnesses for each
                        other, as "a feller feeling," as Covode would say, doubtless makes them feel
                        "wondrous kind." Mr. Pettis will please have his certificate on the same
                        point ready for Mr. Covode, as he will doubtless need it one of these days.</p>
                    <p>But Mr. Covode goes farther than the Crawford contest, and plunges into
                        history after the manner of a bull in a china shop, and comes out with the
                        following assortment of broken crockery on his horns. He says:</p>
                    <p>"Some weeks, or perhaps months, before the nomination of Governor Curtin in
                        1863, A. K. M'Clure, Esq, editor of the Chambersburg Repository, came with
                        others twice to Washington City to induce President Lincoln to promise the
                        Governor a Foreign mission, in order to take him off the course as a
                        candidate for Governor, alleging that although he could probably get the
                        nomination, he could not be re-elected if nominated, with the men against
                        him in the State who would oppose him. Both attempts failed, when one of the
                        party came to me and said that there was one man who could accomplish the
                        matter with Mr. Lincoln,--and he was a Cabinet Minister--who did succeed in obtaining the promise from the
                        President, but the arrangement was afterwards violated, and after the
                        Governor's friends had availed themselves of the benefit of the offer upon
                        the part of the President.</p>
                    <p>There are a few immaterial blunders in the foregoing extract, which Mr.
                        Covode will doubtless thank us for correcting. In the first place, Mr.
                        M'Clure never went to Washington for any such purpose as is stated above. In
                        the second place he never proposed to Mr. Covode or any other man that Gov.
                        Curtin should be appointed to a mission because he could not be re-elected.
                        In the third place the effort to obtain a mission never failed with
                        President Lincoln--he having cheerfully assented to it when it was first
                        proposed to him. In the fourth place, Mr. Covode was never present at any
                        conference on the subject and never was asked to aid or interfere in the
                        matter either by Gov. Curtin or any of his friends, so far as we ever had
                        any knowledge. In the fifth place the writer hereof called upon the cabinet
                        officer referred to, without the knowledge of Gov. Curtin and without
                        consulting with any person, and proceeded the same day with the said
                        minister and another gentleman at once to the President, and received from
                        him the assurance that a mission would be placed at Gov. Curtin's disposal
                        at the close of his term in January 1864. In the sixth place, the President
                        never asked Gov. Curtin to decline, and there was therefore no arrangement
                        violated, and in the seventh place we don't exactly see where Mr. Covode
                        comes into the transaction at all. With these slight corrections, we believe
                        Mr. Covode's statement is correct. He probably thought that he had fixed the
                        whole matter, as it was in those days an amiable and we think pardonable
                        weakness, for him to imagine that nothing was done that he did not do
                        himself, but on this question he has committed the too common mistake of
                        reducing his otherwise excusable hallucinations to writing and labelling
                        them history.</p>
                    <p>The truth is simply this: Gov. Curtin was strongly pressed to become a
                        candidate for re-election in 1863, and his most trusted friends, believing
                        that he was physically unequal to the task, were desirous that he should
                        decline, and in this he heartily concurred. Without his knowledge the writer
                        hereof called on President Lincoln and had a frank consultation in relation
                        to his declination. The next day we asked two eminent politicians of the
                        State to go with us to the President and confer on the subject. They did so,
                        and the result of the conference was that we bore to Gov. Curtin a tender of
                        a mission in the President's hand-writing. Subsequently Gov. Curtin called
                        on the President to thank him in person for the generous manner in which the
                        honor had been tendered, and signified his intention of accepting it, as he
                        had fully made up his mind to go abroad to recruit his health. Circumstances
                        over which Gov. Curtin had no control, being no less than the manifest
                        determination of the Union men of the State to accept no other man as their
                        candidate, compelled him to forego his own earnest wishes an accept a
                        re-nomination. So much for the inside history of the case--the outside
                        history strikes us as rather too familiar to the people of Pennsylvania to
                        need any explanation at our hands.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion we beg to assure the Meadville Journal that we are not a candidate for Congress in Crawford county,
                        and that we will not accept the position even if it should succeed in
                        blackguarding us into it. We also assure it that it can vilify us to its own
                        satisfaction, as we suppose that nobody in Crawford county cares any more
                        about what it says of us than we do.</p>

<b>The State Deserter Law</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The piece assails the Harrisburg Telegraph for its "covert assaults" upon
                    Gov. Curtin, whom it criticizes for failing to move more assertively on the
                    deserter law.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Harrisburg Telegraph has recently been making
                        repeated covert assaults upon Gov. Curtin. If the Executive has failed to
                        discharge his duty to the loyal men of the State his official acts are
                        proper subjects for the criticism of the Union press of the State; but it is
                        most reasonable to expect that a Union journal in discussing the policy and
                        acts of a Union administration, should at least be truthful and just if not
                        generous. The action of Gov. Curtin in holding the act of the last
                        legislature relating to deserters, has been made a pretext by the Telegraph for attacking Gov. Curtin in frequent
                        articles, and in no one of them was the truth fairly stated to the public.
                        But a few days before the Governor approved the bill in question, that
                        journal's malignity seems to have culminated in an article, of which the
                        following is an extract:</p>
                    <p>"The bill which prevents draft-sneaks and deserts voting is declared by the
                        present eminent Attorney General, Hon. Wm. M. Meredith, to be
                        constitutional, wise, just and necessary. Yet it is not signed; and the Governor seems fearful of invading the
                        Constitution by giving this measure his approval."</p>
                    <p>The present distinguished Attorney General has never declared the act of the
                        last legislature relating to deserters to be constitutional. We do not know
                        or even guess that he regards it as unconstitutional, as he has not, so far
                        as we have been able to learn, given any opinion on the subject. While he is
                        without his peer as a jurist even among those who are our chosen arbiters of
                        constitutional law, his opinion would not make a single faithless election
                        officer obey the law, while the decision of the court of last resort would
                        command obedience in all sections of the State. We feel assured that
                        Attorney General Meredith would not declare an act of Congress
                        unconstitutional, nor would he assume to declare it constitutional as long
                        as it was not judicially questioned; but when a new enactment of the
                        legislature imposed new and laborious duties, provided new penalties for
                        offenses defined by Congress, and the foundation of the whole structure was
                        contested in the courts, it was not only eminently proper, but an act of
                        manifest duty, for the Executive to call the attention of the court to the
                        great public interests involved in the bill and await its action if it could
                        be had in season to make the law effective. The court did not act with the
                        promptness the public interest palpably demanded, and the Governor, in
                        accordance with his long settled purpose, approved the act.</p>
                    <p>On another point the Telegraph has done injustice
                        to the Executive and to the public. It has in it repeated demands for the
                        approval of the State enactment relating to deserters, treated it as a
                        measure entirely independent of the law of Congress, and even in publishing
                        the law after its approval, it omits the preamble because it would expose
                        its unfairness, to use no harsher term. The Union men of the State should
                        not be misled into a tendency to lawlessness by the perversions and
                        suppressions of journals, which seem to have no higher ambition than to stab
                        an Executive who has uncounted petty hatreds by his eminently successful and
                        patriotic administration. If the act of Congress disfranchising deserters
                        should be declared unconstitutional, then must the act of the late
                        legislature of necessity fall with the parent law. It is but an auxiliary to
                        the act of Congress, and that the legislature well knew the fact is clearly
                        manifest by its preamble, as follows:</p>
                    <p>"Whereas, By the act of the Congress of the United States, entitled, 'An act
                        to amend the several acts heretofore passed to provide for the enrolling and
                        calling out of the national forces, and for other purposes,' and approved
                        March 3d, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-five, all persons who have
                        deserted the military or naval service of the United States, and who have
                        not been discharged or relieved from the penalty or disability therein
                        provided, are deemed and taken to have voluntarily relinquished and
                        forfeited their rights of citizenship and their rights to become citizens,
                        and are deprived of exercising any rights of citizens thereof:<br>And whereas, Persons not citizens of the United
                        States are not, under the constitution and laws of Pennsylvania, qualified
                        electors of this Commonwealth."</p>
                    <p>It will be seen that the legislation of the State is distinctly predicated on
                        the law of Congress, and very properly so. No lawyer would pretend to assume
                        that the legislature of 1866 could define and enforce new penalties for
                        offences committed in 1864 or 1865, and for a journal or politician to
                        insist that such was the intention of the legislature, is to betray a most
                        lamentable ignorance of well settled rules of law, and to make a severe
                        draft upon the supposed disposition of the people to accept or reject the
                        laws of the land as their political prejudices may dictate. The Union party
                        has thus far been the champion of law and order and so it will remain.</p>
                    <p>No one will rejoice more than the writer hereof if the act of the legislature
                        relative to deserters shall be sustained and enforced to the uttermost, and
                        we have done our humble share in these columns and elsewhere to attain the
                        great end desired.</p>

                        Washington and Richmond relating to the proposed trial of Jefferson Davis. A
                        court was held at Norfolk some weeks ago, at which an indictment was found
                        against Davis for treason, and the same court met in Richmond last week,
                        when an array of able counsel, such as Wm. B. Reed, James T. Brady, and
                        several lesser lights of the law, appeared and demanded a speedy trial.</p>
                    <p>All these dispatches, speeches, charges of judges, &amp;c., would
                        naturally induce the people to believe that Jeff Davis is to be really tried
                        for treason and punished. We regret to say that such is not the fact. All
                        the parade about the trial of Davis is just so much mockery of a loyal
                        people. President Johnson, after officially proclaiming Davis to be the
                        chief of assassins, has long since resolved, and pledged the traitors of the
                        South, that Davis shall not be punished, and while Andrew Johnson is
                        President, we assure our readers that Davis will never suffer any penalty of
                        the law for his crimes.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Davis has been charged with the deliberate murder of our brave prisoners
                        at Andersonville and other points of the South, and we have President
                        Johnson's official proclamation still uncontradicted, that the bureau of
                        military justice has evidence of his complicity in the assassination of
                        President Lincoln. Creatures of Davis have been executed by Johnson for both
                        offences. Mrs. Surratt, Payne, Harrold and Azterott have died for obeying
                        Davis, as Johnson has charged, in the murder of Lincoln, and Werz has died
                        for obeying military orders under Davis as Commander-in-chief at
                        Andersonville.</p>
                    <p>What is to be done with the Chief? The assassination of Lincoln and the
                        murder of prisoners are offences against the laws of war, and the civil
                        courts cannot take cognizance of them. Military courts tried and condemned
                        the subordinates of Davis--why is the responsible criminal not tried in the
                        same way? There can be but one solution of the problem. The President dare
                        not direct the trial of Davis by a military commission because it would
                        result in his conviction, and his execution could not then be prevented; but
                        in the civil courts it is entirely safe to try Davis for treason. However
                        just and loyal the Judge may be, the Marshal appointed by Johnson selects
                        the jurors, and it would not require any extraordinary amount of shrewdness
                        to enable the public to understand, that a southern jury, selected by an
                        office-holder appointed by Johnson for the purpose, will take care that
                        Davis is not convicted, no matter what the law is or how flagrantly he may
                        have violated it. Even Gen. Lee, in his testimony before the Congressional
                        Committee, testified that the jurors of Virginia would not convict Davis of
                        treason, for the reason that they still justify secession.</p>
                    <p>Let no one, therefore, be deceived by the newspaper parade about the trial of
                        Davis. President Johnson has the power to shield the arch-traitor, and he
                        means to exercise it. Just as soon as he feels that he dare do so, he will
                        release him from prison on the pretext of failing health, and in a short
                        time Davis will most likely be knocking at the door of the U.S. Senate with
                        Stephens and other rebel leaders for admission as our law-makers, and his
                        demand for his place will be sustained by all the power of Johnson's
                        administration. The truth is not always the pleasantest thing to publish,
                        but the sooner loyal men understand that all professions of the Johnson
                        administration relative to the punishment of treason are utterly false, the
                        better it may be for the nation.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The State Convention of the Heroes of the war against treason was held in
                        Pittsburgh on the 5th inst. and was very largely attended. Every district in
                        the State was represented and the aggregate of soldiers in attendance with
                        regular credentials was not less than five hundred. Gen. Negley was chosen
                        temporary chairman, and Gen. J.T. Owen, of Philadelphia, was permanent
                        President. Among the delegates in attendance we notice the names of Col D.
                        W. Rowe, Maj. John H. Harmony, Capt. John H. Walker, Sergt. Henry Strickler,
                        and private D. M. McCune. The proceedings were marked by great enthusiasm
                        and unanimity, and it will be seen they declared for Grant, Geary and
                        Curtin, and loyal men ruling the nation rescued by loyal blood. The
                        following resolutions were reported by Gen. Fisher, chairman of the
                        committee and were adopted with entire unanimity:</p>
                    <p>WHEREAS, The representatives of the soldiers and sailors of Pennsylvania,
                        assembled in convention, in obedience to a call recognized and formally
                        acted on, throughout the Commonwealth, having in remembrance the suffering
                        and trials endured by the soldiers and sailors of the Union in their
                        successful struggle against the gigantic rebellion, and being determined to
                        perpetuate the great principles established by our arms and sanctified by
                        the blood of our fellow comrades, do resolve,</p>
                    <p>I. That we return to the omnipotent Ruler of the Universe our sincere and
                        heartfelt thanks for the crowning victory vouchsafed to our efforts against
                        a rebellion, which had for its object the destruction of our great Republic.</p>
                    <p>II. That the tender care exercised by the Government and the people for the
                        remains of our martyred heroes, and for their widows and orphans, commands
                        our warmest gratitude.</p>
                    <p>III. That it is contrary to public policy and subversive of the great
                        principles won by patriotic blood, to permit any to hold offices of honor or
                        profit under the General Government, who, by word or deed embarrassed the
                        Union armies, or cast odium on the cause for which they fought.</p>
                    <p>IV. That the soldiers of Pennsylvania should organize in their respective
                        counties to take care that the triumph of our army be not fruitless and the
                        just results of our great endeavors remain ungathered, by concessions of any
                        of the national points at issue in the struggle, to the defeated party; or
                        by yielding advantages fairly won; and we propose the following platform as
                        the basis of organization.</p>
                    <p>V. That such treatment should be accorded to the defeated foe as the most
                        chivalric magnanimity requires, but without yielding a triumph compromising
                        the right, or, above all, deserting our allies.</p>
                    <p>VI. That such and so many guarantees shall be demanded from the South, and
                        incorporated in the National Constitution, as are necessary to prevent the
                        recurrence of rebellion, secure justice and freedom to all men of all
                        classes, conditions, and colors, and guard the national faith from
                        violation.</p>
                    <p>VII. That rebels ought not to be precipitated into power, before such
                        guarantees have been obtained, and that, accordingly, Congress, to which
                        rightfully pertains all questions of reconstruction, should be cordially
                        sustained in their demand for such guarantees.</p>
                    <p>VIII. That the legislation whereby Congress attempted to defend and protect
                        our allies, the loyal men of the South, against the deadly hatred of the
                        common enemy, and to make good to a race the freedom proffered as the price
                        of aid and awarded as the due of loyalty, deserves unqualified approval.</p>
                    <p>IX. That with the beginning of the war the nation took a new departure, and
                        henceforth her Constitution will be read in the interests of liberty,
                        justice, and security, according to the lights of its preamble and the
                        immoral declaration of independence, under the teachings of its authors and
                        compatriots. Too long already has it been interpreted in the interests of
                        slavery and caste.</p>
                    <p>X. That Major General John W. Geary having given just evidence of his
                        devotion to the Union during the great rebellion by volunteering in its
                        defence and serving faithfully during the war, when many, like Heister
                        Clymer, who now claim to be equally patriotic, were rendering aid and
                        comfort to the rebels, and he being now before the people of Pennsylvania as
                        a candidate for the office of Governor, we, his fellow soldiers in that hour
                        of trial, pledge to him our hearty support, and ask the same for him from
                        all those who acknowledge the debt of gratitude due from the country to its
                        saviors.</p>
                    <p>XI. That the soldiers of Pennsylvania recognize no warmer or true friend than
                        Governor Andrew G. Curtin. His name is our watchword, his fame our hope, and
                        his merit our glory. The unswerving love of the "soldiers' friend' will be
                        reciprocated with unfaltering devotion.</p>
                    <p>XII. That we appeal hopefully to Congress for speedy action on the question
                        of equalizing bounties to the soldiers.</p>
                    <p>XIII. That believing "treason is a crime and that traitors should be
                        punished," we demand that leading traitors shall be convicted and executed,
                        as an example to traitors for all time to come.</p>
                    <p>XIV. That we request Congress so to legislate as to protect American industry
                        by a high protective tariff.</p>
                    <p>XV. That the Convention is able to express its sentiments upon the whole
                        matter of issues and candidates in few words, which may answer as banner
                        inscriptions in the coming campaign--"God, Grant, Geary, Victory!"</p>
                    <p>A number of able speeches were made during the proceedings of the Convention,
                        all breathing a true and patriotic spirit, and not one proposed to betray
                        the country into the hands and rule of the traitors they had to overthrow by
                        the sword. Altogether we regard the Solders' Convention as one of the most
                        promising signs of the times, and it gives the loyal men the assurance that
                        neither rebel insolence or northern treachery can compass the overthrow of
                        the Union party in Pennsylvania.</p>
