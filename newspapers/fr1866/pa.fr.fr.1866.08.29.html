<b>Reconstruction</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A transcript of Thaddeus Stevens's remarks before Congress just prior to
                    the introduction of the bill to "'enable the States lately in rebellion to
                    regain their privilege in the Union.'" Because the bill reached the floor on the
                    last day of the session, it was not voted upon. Had it been submitted earlier,
                    however, it would have easily passed the House by a two-thirds margin, according
                    to the article. In his address, Stevens proclaimed passage of the bill, which
                    calls for universal male suffrage, to be the best way to guarantee the rights of
                    both black men and white men in the South.<br>

<b>Can Deserters Vote?</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors revisit the controversy over deserter disfranchisement, and
                    question whether the outcome of the Reilly vs. Huber case, which brought the
                    issue before the state supreme court, put to rest the concern over voting
                    irregularities.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>By reference to the election proclamation in our advertising columns, it will
                        be seen that the act of the last legislature relative to the votes of
                        deserters, imposes sever penalties upon election officers for receiving such
                        votes, and also visits with punishment the tender of such ballots. As the
                        question is a most important one, and will be construed differently by
                        persons of different political proclivities, we propose to state it as it is
                        presented by the laws and the courts.</p>
                    <p>The act of Congress of March 3, 1865, provides that any persons who were
                        deserters, either from the draft by refusing to report, or from the army, or
                        who had fled the jurisdiction of the government to escape service, "shall be
                        deemed and taken to have voluntary relinquished and forfeited their rights
                        of citizenship, and their rights to become citizens." In addition, they are
                        declared ineligible to any office of honor or profit under the United
                        States. Under this act deserters were clearly disfranchised, as the
                        constitution of our State confers suffrage only on citizens of the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>The Democrats protested against this law as being unconstitutional, and, as a
                        large majority of the deserters were confessedly Democrats, they publicly
                        advised election officers to disregard the law. Extraordinary as such
                        counsel was, proposing to make election boards the judges of validity of our
                        laws instead of our Supreme Courts, we believe that every Democratic
                        election board in the State received such votes, while Union boards as
                        uniformly rejected them. The main ground on which the Democrats urged the
                        election boards to nullify the law, was that it was an act of Congress, and
                        our State laws made different provisions relative to suffrage.</p>
                    <p>In the case of Reily vs. Huber, tried in the Court of common pleas of this
                        county, the constitutionality of the act of Congress was broadly raised, and
                        it was decided that, while the penalty of disfranchisement was but just for
                        desertion, the crime was not ascertained under the act of Congress by due
                        process of law. Judgement was therefore entered against the election judge
                        on a case stated, for one dollar and costs. The case was carried to the
                        Supreme Court of the State, where the judgement of the court below was
                        affirmed--Justice Strong deciding that while the penalty was just, Reily had
                        not been properly convicted and sentenced, and therefore was entitled to
                        vote. This decision would be conclusive of the binding force of the act of
                        Congress in Pennsylvania, until decided otherwise by the Supreme Court of
                        the United States; but in the meantime the legislature of the State passed a
                        law to carry into effect the same forfeiture of suffrage, and imposing
                        stringent penalties for offering or receiving the votes of deserters.</p>
                    <p>The Pennsylvania statute provides in the first section that it "shall be
                        unlawful for the judge or inspectors of any such election to receive any
                        ballot or ballots" from persons defined as deserters in the act of Congress;
                        and also that it "shall be unlawful for any such person (deserter) to offer
                        to vote any ballot or ballots." The second section provides that, receiving
                        such votes by an election officer, shall be a misdemeanor, and on
                        conviction, the person offending shall pay a fine of not less than one
                        hundred dollars and undergo imprisonment not less than sixty days. The third
                        section imposes like penalties upon deserters who may vote or offer to vote
                        at any election in the State; and the fourth section fixes the same
                        penalties for any person who "shall hereafter persuade or advise" deserters
                        to vote.</p>
                    <p>It must be born in mind that the act of our legislature has never been judicially questioned, and its provisions remain
                        the law of the commonwealth, binding upon all its citizens, until it is
                        repealed or declared invalid by the proper judicial tribunals. It is not competent for an election board, a town
                        meeting, or any body of authority whatever other than the courts, to
                        determine whether an act of assembly is in conflict with the constitution of
                        the State or of the Union, and while it is unquestioned by the proper
                        authority, it must be obeyed. If election boards can determine questions of
                        constitutional law to suit their political convictions or prejudices with
                        impunity, then might any and every man decide that the laws against robbery,
                        arson, burglary and murder are wrong, and proceed upon his own judgement, as
                        to the validity of laws, to rob, burn or murder to suit himself. We have
                        tribunals created to determine all such questions, and to them and them only
                        can an appeal be made against the constitutionality of legislation. It may
                        be insisted that on the principle decided in the case of Reily vs. Huber,
                        the Supreme Court will declare the act of the legislature unconstitutional;
                        but the same court decided the conscription law unconstitutional on the 9th
                        of November 1863, and on final judgement, in the same case, it decided the
                        same law constitutional on the 16th of January, 1864. How it may decide the
                        act of Assembly, we cannot anticipate so as to nullify the law, and it is
                        the duty of every election officer, and every citizen, to obey it.</p>
                    <p>The act of the legislature is officially published as part of the law to
                        govern election officers and voters, and it is the sworn duty of every such
                        officer to enforce it, and it is the duty of every law-abiding citizen to
                        aid the officers in its observance.</p>

                        To the Editors of the Franklin Repository:
                    </p>
                    <p>Having been selected by the Central Committee of the National Union party,
                        without my knowledge and consent, a delegate to the late Philadelphia
                        Convention, I attended it to ascertain the principles and purposes proposed
                        to be carried out by its members.</p>
                    <p>It had been publicly and uniformly claimed until that time that the National
                        Union party, which had called the Convention, was a loyal party, with loyal
                        principles and could not make common cause with traitors and copperheads.</p>
                    <p>In that convention no word was uttered against treason, no word of cheer or
                        assurance of protection was given to the loyal men now oppressed by traitors
                        in the South, and its chief work was to form a coalition with unrepentant
                        enemies of the government to restore them to honor and power. Nor did it
                        stop with the principle that traitors must be restored to the power they
                        used to betray the Union into the power of treason, but the National Union
                        party was transferred bodily to the copperheads in the North, and the demand
                        made that the friends of the administration must support the copperhead
                        candidates for Governor, Congress and the Legislature. Having long cherished
                        political convictions which are not in harmony with the principles of the
                        administration as now declared, it is but an act of justice to myself to say
                        that I shall hereafter, as heretofore, cordially support the entire Union
                        ticket, and give my best efforts for its success. If for thus maintaining
                        fidelity to the principles taught the nation by Andrew Johnson, I shall
                        prove offensive to his administration as an official, my place is at his
                        disposal, but my convictions and my sense of duty are my own.<br> JOHN W.

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>At last the nation has a full account of the New Orleans massacre, with the
                        portions of official despatches deliberately suppressed by President Johnson
                        supplied, and it is the most damning record ever presented against an
                        administration. It shows conclusively that from the outset, the President
                        not only sympathised with the rebels, but he actually counseled lawlessness
                        and violence against the Union men of Louisiana. Thanks to the firmness of
                        Gen. Grant, the whole record is before the world, and it leaves not the
                        shadow of justification or excuse for the President and his rebel supporters
                        in New Orleans.</p>
                    <p>The official correspondence opens with a despatch from Lieut. Gov. Voorhies
                        to the President, notifying the President that the Convention was called and
                        that Gov. Wells had issued writs of election to fill the vacancies. Next is
                        a despatch dated 28th July, from Voorhies and the rebel Attorney General
                        Herron, stating that a radical mass meeting had been held ending in a riot;
                        that the speeches were violent and incendiary, (they denounced treason) and
                        they add--"You (the President) bitterly denounced." They notify the
                        President that they "contemplated to have the members of
                            the Convention under process from the criminal court," and
                            ask--"Is the military to interfere?" To this
                        the President replies on the same day that "the military
                            will be expected TO SUSTAIN, AND NOT TO OBSTRUCT OR INTERFERE
                            with the proceedings of the court." The
                        President on the same day asks Gov. Wells why he has recognized the
                        convention, and by what authority the convention can assume to represent the
                        whole State. Gov. Wells answers on same day that the people will elect
                        members to fill all vacancies, and thus the whole people of the State will
                        be represented.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Baird telegraphs on the same day to Secretary Stanton, stating that the
                        Lieut. Governor and Attorney General consider the convention unlawful, and
                        propose to break it up. He says he cannot countenance such action, and asks
                        explicit instructions. No instructions were sent.
                        Instead of telegraphing Gen. Baird, the President discarded the military
                        commanders, and placed Gens. Sheridan and Baird subject
                            to the orders of the rebel Attorney General Herron, formerly a General
                            in the rebel service. His dispatch is as follows:</p>
                    <p>JOHNSON TO THE REBEL HERRON.</p>
                    <p>Executive Mansion,<br> Washington, July 30, 1866.</p>
                    <p>
                        To Andrew J. Herron, Attorney General of Louisiana, New
                            Orleans:
                    </p>
                    <p>You will call on General Sheridan or whoever may be in
                            command for sufficient force to sustain the civil authority in
                            suppressing all illegal or unlawful assemblies, who usurp or assume to
                            exercise any power or authority without first having obtained the
                            consent of the people of the State. If there is to be a
                        convention let it be composed of delegates chosen fresh from the people of
                        the whole State. The people must be first consulted in reference to changing
                        the organic law of the State. Usurpation will not be
                            tolerated. The law and the constitution must be sustained, and
                        thereby peace and order.<br> ANDREW JOHNSON.</p>
                    <p>With such an invitation to murder and be protected by the Union troops, the
                        rebels at once proceeded to fulfil their bloody work. The next dispatch is
                        from Lieut. Gov. Voorhees, as follows:</p>
                    <p>VOORHEES TO JOHNSON</p>
                    <p>New Orleans, July 30, 1866.</p>
                    <p>
                        To His Excellency President Johnson:
                    </p>
                    <p>Convention met. A riot broke out in the city. So far the
                            police has the upper hand. Several white and colored persons
                        killed. Called on Gen. Baird for assistance, which was cheerfully tendered.
                        Intense excitement. Convention broken up.<br>
                        ALBERT VOORHEES,<br> Lieut. Gov. Louisiana.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Baird, the Union Department commander, next report to Secretary Stanton
                        the account of the riot. He says that "the police, aided by the citizens,
                        became the assailants, and from the evidence, I am
                            forced to believe, exercised great brutality in making arrests."
                        At this point Mayor Monroe appears on the record by a letter to Gen. Baird
                        in which he asks Baird's support "to disperse this unlawful assembly," which
                        Gen. Baird promptly declines. He says to Monroe that he understands it to be
                        the right "of all loyal citizens of the U. States to meet peaceably and
                        discuss freely questions concerning their civil government." The President
                        next assured Lieut. Gov. Voorhees again that the military must support the
                        courts. On the 31st of July Gen. Baird telegraphs Stanton that the city is
                        quiet, and adds that "nearly all unite in attributing
                            the chief blame to the police for the troubles yesterday." On the
                        same day Gen. Baird telegraphs the War Department, as follows:</p>
                    <p>DISPATCH FROM GEN. BAIRD.</p>
                    <p>New Orleans, July 31.</p>
                    <p>Comparative quiet has been restored in this city by the military, who still
                        occupy the streets. There is, however, apprehension of slight disturbances
                        in the lower faubourg of the city. In consequence of the
                            limited force at my command I am compelled to make use of the city
                            police, whose conduct in the riots of yesterday is most reprehensible.
                            There is every reason to fear the imminent peril to which the lives and
                            property of Union men of the city will be subjected by restoration of
                            the reins of power to the present civil authorities of the
                        city.<br> A. BAIRD, Major-General.</p>
                    <p>Another dispatch from Gen. Baird the same day to Gen. Howard says that "about
                        forty persons have been killed and a large number wounded, nearly all being
                        friendly to the convention." This is followed by a dispatch from Atty. Gen.
                        Herron stating that he had ordered the arrest of the few members of the
                        Convention who had escaped the massacre. At this point Gen. Sheridan
                        appears, and sends his first dispatch, on his return from Texas, dated the
                        1st inst. He had been absent in Texas when the massacre occurred. We give
                        his dispatch in full, including the sentence suppressed
                            by the President, which we give in italics:</p>
                    <p>GEN. SHERIDAN TO GEN. GRANT.</p>
                    <p>New Orleans, August 1, 1866.</p>
                    <p>GENERAL: You are doubtless aware of the serious riot which occurred in this
                        city on the 30th. A political body, styling itself the Convention of 1864,
                        met on the 30th, for, as it is alleged, the purpose of remodelling the
                        present constitution of the State. The leaders were political agitators and
                        revolutionary men, and the action of the Convention was liable to produce
                        breeches of the public peace.</p>
                    <p>I had made up my mind to arrest the head men if the proceedings of the
                        Convention were calculated to disturb the tranquility of the department, but
                        I had no cause for action until they committed the overt act. In the meantime, official duty called me to Texas, and the
                            Mayor of the city, during my absence, suppressed the convention by the
                            use of the police force, and in so doing attacked the members of the
                            Convention and a party of two hundred negroes with firearms, clubs and
                            knives, in a manner so unnecessary and atrocious as to compel me to say
                            that it was murder. About forty whites and blacks were thus
                        killed, and about one hundred wounded. Everything is now quiet, but I deem
                        it best to maintain a military supremacy for a few days, until the affair is
                        fully investigated.</p>
                    <p>I believe the sentiment of the general community is great regret at this
                        unnecessary cruelty, and that the police could have made any arrest they saw
                        fit without sacrificing lives.<br> P. H. SHERIDAN,<br> Major General
                        Commanding.</p>
                    <p>It will be seen that the President mutilated Gen. Sheridan's dispatch by
                        suppressing the most important sentence in it. That he did so mutilate and
                        suppress it cannot be doubted for he gave the dispatch
                            out for publication.</p>
                    <p>Next we have a dispatch from Gen. Baird explaining to Secretary Stanton the
                        necessity for martial law to hold the police under military supervision. But
                        the President did not want the rebel murderers restrained, and on the 1st of
                        August he telegraphs Gen. Baird still "not to enterpose any obstacles in the
                        way of the civil authorities," the men who had conceived and executed the
                        murders. On the same day the President telegraphs through his Adjutant
                        General, to the rebel Lieut. Governor inquiring whether martial law could
                        not be dispensed with. The members of the Convention were not all butchered,
                        and he seemed uneasy lest some of them should escape with their lives. Of
                        course Gov. Voorhees insisted in reply that the civil authorities "could
                        easily enforce the law" and adds--"Martial law wholly unnecessary." By this
                        time Gen. Sheridan had been in New Orleans long enough to understand the
                        whole affair thoroughly, and he telegraphed as follows:</p>
                    <p>GEN. SHERIDAN TO GEN. GRANT.</p>
                    <p>New Orleans, August 2, 1866.</p>
                    <p>
                        U. S. Grant, General, Washington, D. C.
                    </p>
                    <p>The more information I obtain of the affair of the 30th in this city, the more revolting it becomes. It was not riot; it was an
                            absolute massacre by the police, which was not excelled in murderous
                            cruelty by that of Fort Pillow. It was a murder which the Mayor and
                            police of the city perpetrated without the shadow of a necessity.
                            Furthermore, I believe it was premeditated, and every indication points
                            to this. I recommend the removing of this bad man. I believe it
                        would be hailed with the sincerest gratification by two-thirds of the
                        population of the city. There has been a feeling of insecurity on the part
                        of the people here, on account of this man, which is now so much increased,
                            that the safety of life and property does not rest
                            with the civil authorities, but with the military.<br> P. H.
                        SHERIDAN,<br> Major General Commanding.</p>
                    <p>It is needless to say that the above dispatch was at once suppressed by
                        President Johnson. After mutilating the first dispatch he could do nothing
                        with the second one but attempt to hide it. But Gen. Sheridan saw his
                        mutilated dispatch, and the suppression of his later dispatches, and he
                        appealed to Gen. Grant to demand the publication of the whole official
                        correspondence. Gen. Grant did demand it, and President
                            Johnson was compelled to comply, as he found that he could not
                        make two of his bravest and best Generals parties to his falsehood and
                        treachery. On the 3d inst., Gen Sheridan again telegraphed Gen. Grant as
                        follows:</p>
                    <p>GEN. SHERIDAN TO GEN. GRANT</p>
                    <p>New Orleans, August 3.</p>
                    <p>
                        U. S. Grant, General, Washington:
                    </p>
                    <p>I have the honor to report quiet in the city, but considerable excitement in
                        the public mind. There is no interference on the part of the military with
                        the civil government, which performs all its duties without hindrance. I
                        have permitted the retention of Military Governor, appointed during my
                        absence, as it gives confidence and enables the military to know what is
                        occurring in the city. He does not interfere with civil matters. Unless good judgement is exercised there will be an exodus
                            of Northern capital and Union men, which will be injurious to the city
                            and to the whole country. I will remove the Military Governor in
                        a day or two. I again strongly advise that some
                            disposition be made to change the present Mayor, as I believe it would
                            do more to restore confidence than anything that could be done.
                        If the present Governor could be changed also it would not be amiss.<br> P.
                        H. Sheridan,<br> Major General Commanding.</p>
                    <p>Notwithstanding President Johnson's repeated dispatches against martial law,
                        Gen. Grant answered Gen. Sheridan instructing him to continue martial law,
                        as follows:</p>
                    <p>GEN. GRANT TO GEN. SHERIDAN.</p>
                    <p>Headquarters Army United States,<br> Washington, D. C., Aug. 3, 1866.</p>
                    <p>
                        Major General Sheridan, New Orleans, La.:
                    </p>
                    <p>Continue to enforce martial law as far as may be necessary to preserve the
                        peace, and do not allow any of the civil authorities to
                            act if you deem such action dangerous to the public safety. Lose
                        no time in investigating and reporting the causes that led to the riot and
                        the facts which occurred.<br> U. S. GRANT, General.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Grant did not think proper to sustain the rebel civil authorities in the
                        murder of Union men, and he ordered Gen. Sheridan to depose whenever he
                        thought proper.</p>
                    <p>The President was thus foiled by his faithful Union Generals in screening the
                        rebels, and he suppressed Gen. Sheridan's dispatches with the hope of
                        getting him to say something, in reply to direct questions, to palliate the
                        massacre. With that view he addressed the following dispatch to Gen.
                        Sheridan, by which it will be seen that he asks especially only as to the evidences of guilt on the part of Union
                        men. His cross-examination of Gen. Sheridan in behalf of the rebel
                        murderers was as follows:</p>
                    <p>THE PRESIDENT TO GEN. SHERIDAN.</p>
                    <p>Executive Mansion,<br> Washington, D. C., Aug. 4, 1866.</p>
                    <p>
                        To Major General Sheridan, Commanding, &amp;c., New
                            Orleans, La.:
                    </p>
                    <p>We have been advised here that prior to the assembling of the illegal and
                        extinct convention elected in 1864, inflammatory and insurrectionary
                        speeches were made to a mob composed of white and colored persons, urging them to arm and equip themselves for the purpose of
                            protecting and sustaining the convention in its illegal and unauthorized
                            proceedings, intended and calculated to upturn and supersede the
                            existing State government of Louisiana, which had been recognized by the
                            Government of the United States. Furthermore, did the mob assemble and
                            was it armed for the purpose of sustaining the convention in its
                            usurpation and revolutionary proceedings? Have any arms been taken from
                            persons since the 30th ult., who were supposed or known to be connected
                            with this mob? Have not various individuals been assassinated and shot
                            by persons connected with this mob, without good cause, and in violation
                            of the public peace and good order? Was not the assembling of this
                            convention and the gathering of the mob for its defence and protection
                            the main cause of the riotous and unlawful proceedings of the civil
                            authorities of New Orleans? Have steps been taken by the civil
                        authorities to arrest and try any and all those who were engaged in this
                        riot and those who have committed offences in violation of law? Can ample
                        justice be meted by the civil authorities to all offenders against the law?
                        Will General Sheridan please furnish me a brief reply to the above
                        inquiries, with such other information as he may be in possession of? Please
                        answer by telegraph at your earliest convenience.<br> ANDREW JOHNSON,<br>
                        President of the United States.</p>
                    <p>In reply to this direct appeal from the President to Gen. Sheridan to say
                        something to excuse the rebel murderers, Gen. Sheridan reiterated the truth
                        as follows:</p>
                    <p>GEN. SHERIDAN TO THE PRESIDENT.</p>
                    <p>New Orleans, August 6, 1866.</p>
                    <p>
                        His Excellency Andrew Johnson, President of the United
                            States,
                    </p>
                    <p>I have the honor to make the following reply to your despatch of August 4:</p>
                    <p>A very large number of the colored people marched in procession on Friday
                        night, July 27, and were addressed from the steps of the city Hall by Dr.
                        Dostie, Ex-Governor Hahn and others. The speech of Dostie was intemperate in
                        language and sentiments. The speeches of the others, so
                            far as I can learn, were characterized by moderation. I have not
                        given you the words of Dr. Dostie's speech, as the version published was
                        denied, but from what I have learned of the man, I believe they were
                        intemperate.</p>
                    <p>The convention assembled at 12 M., on the 30th, the timid members absenting
                        themselves because of the tone of the general public was ominous of trouble.
                        I think there were but about twenty-six members present. In front of the
                        Mechanics' Institute, where the meeting was held, there were assembled some
                        colored men, women and children, perhaps eighteen or twenty, and in the
                        Institute a number of colored men, probably 150.</p>
                    <p>Among those outside and inside there might have been a
                            pistol in the possession of every tenth man. About 1 P. M., a
                        procession of say from sixty to one hundred and thirty colored men marched
                        up Burgundy street and across Canal street, towards the convention, carrying
                        an American flag. These men had about one pistol to
                            every ten men, and canes and clubs in addition. While crossing
                        Canal street a row occurred. There were many spectators on the streets,
                            and their manner and tone towards the procession
                            unfriendly.</p>
                    <p>A shot was fired, by whom I am not able to state, but
                            believe it to have been by a policeman at some colored man in the
                            procession. This led to shots and a rush after the procession. On
                        arrival at the front of the institute, there was some throwing of brickbats
                        by both sides. The police, who had been held well in hand, were vigorously
                        marched to the scene of disorder. The procession entered the institute with
                        the flag, about six or eight remaining outside.</p>
                    <p>A row occurred between a policeman and one of the colored men, and a shot was
                        fired by one of the parties, which led to an
                            indiscriminate fire on the building through the windows by the
                        policemen. This had been going on for a short time when a white flag
                        was displayed from the windows of the institute, whereupon the firing ceased
                        and the policemen rushed into the building.</p>
                    <p>From the testimony of the wounded men and others who were inside the
                        building, the policemen opened with an indiscriminate
                            fire upon the audience until they had emptied their revolvers, when they
                            retired, and those inside barricaded the doors. The doors were broken in
                            and the firing again commenced, when many of the colored and white
                            people escaped through the doors, or passed out by the policemen
                        outside.</p>
                    <p>
                        But as they came out the policemen who formed the circle
                            nearest the building fired upon them, and they were again fired upon by
                            the citizens who formed the outer circle. Many of those wounded and
                            taken prisoners, and others who were prisoners and not wounded, were
                            fired upon by their captors and by citizens. The wounded were stabbed
                            while lying on the ground, and their heads beaten with brickbats, in the
                            yard of the building, whither some of the colored men escaped and
                            partially secreted themselves. They were fired upon and killed or
                            wounded by policemen.
                    </p>
                    <p>Some men were killed and wounded several squares from the scene. Members of the convention were wounded by the policemen
                            while in their hands as prisoners, some of them mortally. The
                        immediate cause of this terrible affair was the assemblage of this
                        convention. The remote cause was the bitter and antagonist feeling which has
                        been growing in this community since the advent of the present Mayor, who in the organization of his police force selected many
                            desperate men, and some of them known murderers.</p>
                    <p>People of New Orleans were overawed by want of confidence in the Mayor and
                        the fear of the Thugs, many of whom he had selected for his police force. I
                        have frequently been spoken to by prominent citizens on this subject, and
                        have heard them express fear and want of confidence in Mayor Monroe, ever
                        since the intimation of this last convention movement. I must condemn the
                        course of several of the city papers for supporting by their articles the
                        bitter feeling of bad men.</p>
                    <p>As to the merciless manner in which the convention was broken up, I feel
                        obliged to confess strong repugnance. It is useless to
                            attempt to disguise the hostility that exists on the part of many here
                            towards Northern men; and this unfortunate affair has so precipitated
                            matters that there is now a test of what shall be the status of Northern
                            men: whether they can live here without being in constant dread, whether
                            they can be protected in life and property and have justice in the
                            courts. If this matter is permitted to pass over without a
                        thorough and determined prosecution of those engaged in it, we may look for
                        frequent scenes of the same kind.</p>
                    <p>No steps have as yet been taken by the civil authorities
                            to arrest citizens who were engaged in the massacre, or policemen who
                            perpetrated such cruelties. The members of the convention have been
                            indicted by the Grand Jury, and many of them arrested and held to bail.
                            As to whether the civil authorities can mete out ample justice to the
                            guilty parties on both sides, I must say it is my opinion unequivocally
                            that they cannot.</p>
                    <p>Judge Abel, whose course I have watched for nearly a year, I now consider one of the most dangerous that we have here
                            to the peace and quiet of the city. The leading men of the
                        convention, King, Cutler, Hahn and others, have been political agitators and
                        bad men. I regret to say that the course of Governor Wells has been
                        vacillating, and that during the late trouble he has shown very little of
                        the man.<br> P. H. SHERIDAN,<br> Major General Commanding.</p>
                    <p>Such is a plain, unvarnished history of the deliberate,
                            premeditated rebel massacre of Union men in New Orleans, and the
                        official record fixes upon President Johnson the blistering stain of aiding,
                        encouraging and approving it, and it is approved by all who sustain the
                        policy of his administration and demand that rebels should be restored to
                        power. This terrible page in our history cannot but arouse the loyal
                        sentiment of the North, and make it demand with renewed earnestness, and
                        with most inflexible purpose, that murderous rebels
                            shall not rule the land they sought in vain to destroy by causeless
                        war!</p>
