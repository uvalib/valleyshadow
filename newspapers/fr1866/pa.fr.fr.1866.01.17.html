                    <p>The Cincinnati Gazette says: A friend of ours has
                        sent us one of the unbound sheets of a Confederate school book, entitled
                        "Geographical Reader for the Dixie Children," which shows the state of happy
                        innocence in which the youth of that favored land would have grown up had
                        not the unbelievers been permitted to prevail. The chapter under the head
                        "The United States," is a compendium of the political, moral and religious
                        history of the rise and progress of the rebellion:</p>
                    <p>THE UNITED STATES</p>
                    <p>1. This was once the most prosperous country in the world. Nearly a hundred
                        years ago it belonged to England; but the English made such hard laws that
                        the people said they would not obey them. After a long bloody war of seven
                        years they gained their independence, and for many years were prosperous and
                        happy.</p>
                    <p>2. In the meantime both English and American ships went to Africa and brought
                        away many of those poor heathen negroes and sold them for slaves. Some
                        people said it was wrong, and asked the King of England to stop it. He
                        replied that he "knew it was wrong, but the slave-trade brought much money
                        into his treasury, and it should continue." But both countries afterwards
                        did pass laws to stop this trade. In a few years the Northern States,
                        finding their climate too cold for the negro to be profitable, sold them to
                        the people living further South. Then the Northern States passed laws to
                        forbid any persons owning slaves in their borders.</p>
                    <p>3. Then the Northern people began to preach, to lecture and to write about
                        the sin of slavery. The money for which they sold their slaves was now
                        partly spent in trying to persuade the Southern States to send their slaves
                        back to Africa. And when the territories were settled they were not willing
                        for any of them to become slaveholding. This would soon have made the North
                        much stronger than the South. And many of the men said they would vote for a
                        law to free all the negroes in the country. The Southern men tried to show
                        how unfair this would be, but still they kept on.</p>
                    <p>4. In the year 1860 the Abolitionists became strong enough to elect one of
                        their men for President. Abraham Lincoln was a weak man, and the South
                        believed he would allow laws to be made which would deprive them of their
                        rights. So the Southern States seceded, and elected Jefferson Davis for
                        their President. This so enraged President Lincoln that he declared war, and
                        has exhausted nearly all the strength of the nation in a vain attempt to
                        whip the South back into the Union. Thousands of lives have been lost, and
                        the earth has been drenched with blood; but still Abraham is unable to
                        conquer the "rebels," as he calls the South. The South only asks to be let
                        alone, and to divide the public property equally. It would have been wise in
                        the North to have said to her Southern sisters, "if you are not content to
                        dwell with us longer, depart in peace. We will divide the inheritance with
                        you, and may you be a great nation."</p>
                    <p>5. This country possesses many ships, has fine cities and towns, many
                        railroads, steamboats, canals, manufactures, &amp;c. The people are
                        ingenious, and noted for their tact in driving a bargain. They are refined
                        and intelligent on all subjects but that of negro slavery; on this they are
                        mad.</p>
                    <p>SOUTHERN CONFEDERACY</p>
                    <p>3. This is a great country. The Yankees tho't to starve us out when they sent
                        their ships to guard our seaport towns. But we have learned to make a great
                        many things; to do without others; and, above all, to trust in the smiles of
                        the God of battles. We had few guns, little ammunition, and not much of
                        anything but food, cotton and tobacco; but the people helped themselves and
                        God helped the people. We were considered an indolent and weak people, but
                        our enemies have found us strong, because we had justice on our side.</p>
                    <p>4. The Southern people are noted for being high-minded and courteous. A
                        stranger seldom lacks friends in this country. Much of the field work is
                        done by slaves. These are generally well used, and often have as much pocket
                        money as their mistresses. They are contented and happy, and many of them
                        are Christians. The sin of the South lies not in holding slaves, but they
                        are sometimes mistreated. Let all the little boys and girls remember that
                        slaves are human, and that God will hold them to account for treating them
                        with injustice.</p>
                    <p>5. The Southern Confederacy is at present a sad country; but president Davis
                        is a good and wise man, and many of the generals and other officers of the
                        army are pious. There are a good many good praying people in the land, and
                        we may hope that our cause will prosper. When the righteous are in authority
                        the nation rejoiceth, but when the wicked bear rule the nation mourneth.
                        Then remember, little boys, when you are men, never vote for a bad man to
                        govern the country.</p>

<b>An Important Decision</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In his much anticipated ruling in the Rowe vs. Stenger case, Judge King has
                    determined that "the penalty of forfeiture of citizenship" cannot be "inflicted
                    without due process of law," therefore, deserters "can be disfranchised only
                    upon conviction of the offence by some competent tribunal." Though the editors
                    respect the Judge's decision, they maintain the hope that the state supreme
                    court will review the case since, as it stands, there is still considerable
                    confusion over whether deserters will be punished for their refusal to serve in
                    the late war.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Judge King yesterday delivered a most important decision in the court of
                        quarter sessions of this county, in the case of Rowe vs. Stenger. Mr.
                        Stenger was returned as elected to the office of District Attorney last
                        fall, and Colonel Rowe contested the election on the ground that the
                        majority of Mr. Stenger was made up of votes cast by men who were deserters
                        from the draft or from the military service, and are disfranchised by the
                        act of Congress.</p>
                    <p>Judge King held that the penalty of forfeiture of citizenship could not be
                        inflicted without due process of law, and that deserters can be
                        disfranchised only upon conviction of the offence by some competent
                        tribunal. As the act of Congress makes no provision for the judicial
                        ascertainment and conviction of the crime, and the laws of the State make no
                        such test of the qualification of the voters, the votes of such men must be
                        accepted. In the decision he does not raise the question of the power of
                        Congress to impose a penalty effecting the right of suffrage in a State, and
                        he expressly waives the issue raised as to whether or not the act of
                        Congress is an ex post facto law, inasmuch as the
                        point decided is conclusive of the case.</p>
                    <p>Such a decision coming from a judicial officer second to none in the State in
                        high legal attainments, and eminent for his devotion to the loyal cause,
                        presents the question of the disfranchisement of deserters as one yet to be
                        perfected by the legislature if it is to be enforced at all. It is an issue
                        of too much magnitude to be left in doubt, and we hope to see this case
                        reviewed by the court of last resort in the State. But by the time it will
                        reach that court, the legislature will have adjourned and if the decision of
                        our court should be sustained, we shall have another year of doubt and
                        defiance of the law of Congress by the only party that can hope to profit by
                        the votes of those who deserted their country's cause in the day of peril.
                        Just as is the penalty of the act of Congress, its enforcement must have all
                        the sanctity and ceremony of law, and to this question the attention of the
                        legislature should be deliberately, wisely and promptly directed. We must
                        either have such enactments as will ensure uniform enforcement, or the
                        punishment of desertion must be abandoned. The general government has
                        abandoned it, and it is for the States to declare by their legislation
                        whether they will do likewise.</p>
                    <p>We do not receive a copy of Judge King's decision in time for this week's
                        issue, but in our next we shall give it in full.</p>

<b>State Treasurer's Report</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In his annual report, William H. Kemble, the State Treasurer, offers an
                    optimistic assessment of the Commonwealth's finances, noting that, despite the
                    "extraordinary expenditures of the State during the war," its current economic
                    condition is superior to what it had been on the eve of the conflict. To
                    maintain this prosperity, Kemble suggests three particular policy changes should
                    be enacted: the abolition of the tax on tonnage and the substitution a of a tax
                    on receipts of railroads and canals, the imposition of a tax upon National bank
                    stock, and the repeal of the tax on real estate. Though the editors understand
                    the Treasurer's reasoning, they question the sagacity of the proposed
                    legislative changes, contending that Kemble's recommendations could have a
                    desultory effect on the state's economic growth.<br>

<b>The Spirit and Gen. Coffroth</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors rebuke their counterparts at the Spirit for belatedly endorsing
                    Gen. Coffroth. Coffroth was elected to Congress last year in a contest widely
                    touted as fraudulent. His reputation was further tarnished by revelations that
                    he voted in favor of controversial Republican initiatives to placate his
                    Republican detractors, who had questioned the legitimacy of his victory.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Spirit, after long hesitation, has been
                        brought to the support of Coffroth, and in its last issue defends the frauds
                        of the Democratic return judges, so ably exposed by Judge Black, and urges
                        Coffroth's admission. It is too late in the day to discuss the trickery,
                        perjury and persistent disregard of law by which Gen. Koontz was defrauded
                        out of his certificate; but it is something to see the Spirit find itself on one side or the other of the Coffroth
                        fraud. It has finally concluded that he is "a clever fellow," and
                        "personally" the Spirit has a "high regard" for
                        him. It therefore forgives "his political slip in view of his steadfast
                        adherence to the party since." It then goes at the rumor that Gen. Coffroth
                        bartered his vote for the constitutional amendment abolishing Slavery, to
                        propitiate the Republican Congressmen in his favor in this contest, and
                        pronounces the intimation "just so much stuff, utterly without
                        foundation--the promptings of political malevolence or personal jealousy."</p>
                    <p>Just who would be capable of "personal jealousy" of Gen. Coffroth is to our
                        mind a problem that would be difficult of solution. If there are any such
                        men in this region, we must confess to entire ignorance of them personally,
                        and also of entire ignorance of any man or class of men who have reached
                        such a point in the retrogression of the race. We know whereof we affirm
                        when we say that he exhausted his efforts in the House last winter to barter
                        his vote on the amendment for Republican favor in securing his seat in the
                        present contest, and we believe that the Spirit
                        is also fully satisfied of the truth of what we assert. It is refreshingly
                        stupid at times we confess; but we must protect it against the imputation
                        that it is so consummately stupid as not to know that Gen. Coffroth offered
                        his votes all last winter to secure a seat in the present Congress, to which
                        he was not elected. Equally at variance with the truth is the Spirit's endorsement "of his steadfast adherence to
                        the party since." We grant that he is, in feeling and sympathy, all that the
                            Spirit claims him to be on this point; but
                        while he makes ultra Democratic speeches--like all suspected virtue, going
                        farther than the farthest in denouncing in others what he does himself--and
                        votes the Democratic ticket, he professes at Washington to have sacrificed
                        himself in his party by his vote against their prejudices, and appeals to
                        Republican sympathy on that ground. At home he is a Democrat of the most
                        boisterous pretensions, and at Washington he persistently appeals to
                        Republicans to save him because he is not enough of a Democrat to hurt
                        anybody. On the merits of his case Judge Black has ably argued him out of
                        all claim to be sworn, and his attempt to subsidize himself and play double
                        with everybody must win for him the utter contempt of all. We doubt not that
                        he will soon be officially notified that, if he would get his seat, he must
                        contest it regularly and prove that the majority of Gen. Koontz is made up
                        of illegal votes, and we presume that he will take advantage of his own
                        fraud and become a pensioner under the rule that allows contestants mileage
                        and pay. Beyond this he can have no hope, and since he has just as much
                        claim to a seat as member from Oregon, we see no good reason why he does not
                        shift his contest and get a good round mileage while he is at it. Go in
                        freely, General!--Uncle Sam pays the piper!</p>

<b>Lee and Early</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Though the article commends the Spirit's denunciation of the rebel Gen.
                    Early, who led the 1864 raid on Chambersburg, it criticizes the Democratic
                    journal for failing to criticize "his superior officers, whose bidding he
                    obeyed." Employing a letter written by the commander-in-chief of the Confederate
                    army to substantiate its claim, the piece notes that Lee offered "cordial and
                    unequivocal approval" for Early's military actions throughout most of the war
                    and only relieved him of his duty in March 1865 after Sheridan had defeated him
                    three times.<br>

<b>Important Military Order</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Throughout the South, reports the article, "'erring brethren' of the rebel
                    States" are prosecuting "Union men and officers and soldiers in the Union army"
                    for damages that they suffered as a result of military movements during the late
                    war. In reaction, Gen. Grant has issued an order prohibiting the prosecution of
                    all such cases.<br>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>It is reported that C. M. Duncan submitted his response to the committee of
                    the Senate regarding the charges levelled at him by David McConaughy, his
                    opponent in the late senate race. In his defence, Duncan concedes that his
                    election was secured through the votes of deserters, but he asserts that the law
                    denying deserters their franchise is unconstitutional.<br>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository's Washington correspondent reports that one subject has
                    dominated news in the capital over the past week: the bill to grant suffrage to

                    to the proposed legislation is not restricted to local whites who are "very
                    bitter against the bill," but is endorsed by northern Democrats as well, many of
                    whom intend "to make it an issue in the coming election."<br>
