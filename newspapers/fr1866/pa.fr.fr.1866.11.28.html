<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The second session of the 39th Congress will meet on Monday next. Its session
                        will be brief, expiring by constitutional limitation on the 4th of March,
                        but its duties and responsibilities will be of the gravest character. It
                        comes back from the People, to whom its members appealed to sustain them
                        against an apostate Chief Executive, endorsed by the most decisive popular
                        verdict ever given, and instructed by their constituents to persevere in
                        resisting the encroachments of treason in every guise and form.</p>
                    <p>It will be a proud day for the noble men who never faltered in their devotion
                        to principles. Thaddeus Stevens will return to his great work with unabated
                        vigor and renewed hopes for the safety of the Republic. Although enfeebled
                        by age, his heart beats with all the ardor of youth responsive to the claims
                        of Freedom and Justice, and his towering intellect is unclouded by the
                        ravages of relentless time. While our great Captains have overthrown the
                        hosts of treason in the field, he has, more than all other men, discomfited
                        it in its not less deadly struggles for civil victories. In all the
                        conflicts of ambition, the appeals of power to the timid and time-serving,
                        and the subtle and persistent assaults of treachery upon the integrity of
                        the House, he was the one man who towered over all in marshalling the forces
                        of Freedom and maintaining its holy citadel inviolate. In after years, when
                        posterity shall review the mighty contest, his name will go down from sire
                        to son in reverence, ere the story of history has been learned. Senators
                        will be forgotten; cabinets will pass from public remembrance, and even
                        Presidents will be known as having brightened or faded in the Chief
                        Magistracy of the nation, while over all on the scroll of fame will be
                        written the name of the once humble and friendless New England boy, who
                        wielded the destiny of the Republic against perfidy and power, relying upon
                        the ultimate triumph of Right and the fidelity of the loyal People to the
                        living and to their martyred dead. The People have returned him and his
                        compatriots with the high seal of their approval, and to them is committed
                        the guardianship of our still imperiled nationality.</p>
                    <p>We cannot assume to foreshadow what remedial measures will prove to be
                        necessary for the complete restoration of the Union. It must be restored,
                        and it must be done without unreasonable delay. The quicker it can be done
                        wisely, the better it will be done. It must not only be done, but it must be
                        on an enduring basis. With the solution of this great problem must be solved
                        all issues which could arise in the future. There must be no new traitors to
                        hurl States into the vortex of rebellion and plunge the people into
                        internecine strife. There must be no dregs of Slavery, no vestige of master
                        and bondman. They belong to the past. They have been effaced from our
                        national escutcheon by a deluge of our noblest blood, and they must give
                        place to the beneficent policy of Universal Freedom and unmingled justice in
                        every section of the Union.</p>
                    <p>From the best information we can gather, all is in confusion about the
                        Executive department of the government. What Andrew Johnson would have done had it been in his power, all know.
                        He would have made treason a virtue--loyalty a crime. But the people have
                        been aroused to assert their supreme majesty, and he must either bow to
                        their will or suffer the profound humiliation of witnessing the restoration
                        of the Union on a patriotic basis in defiance of his maudlin speeches, his
                        insolent vetoes, and his perfidious efforts to restore traitors to power.
                        What he may now do, will soon be known, and conjecture is needless. Had he
                        honestly made a tithe of the effort to effect the acceptance of the proposed
                        constitutional amendments, that he has given to make treason defiant and
                        insolently reject even the most magnanimous terms, the work of restoration
                        would now be practically over. But he preferred to be faithless, and has
                        probably made it an imperative necessity to enforce a larger measure of
                        justice than was proposed by the last session of Congress.</p>
                    <p>While the People are prepared to sanction moderation and magnanimity in the
                        restoration of the rebellious States, they are not prepared for any
                        adjustment that will make treason potent, in any degree, in the future
                        administration of the government. They want above all things, a generous and
                        enduring restoration. They have proffered it, and if accepted their faith
                        has been plighted to maintain it; but treason has defied the power that
                        conquered it and spurned the mercy of its conquerers. We consider it safe to
                        assume that the amendments will not be accepted by the South; and if they
                        are rejected, then must the work of restoration begin anew and it will begin
                        at the base of the hideous structure of treason and raze it to the ground.
                        The strong arm of power will take the place of persuasion and magnanimity,
                        and the conquered States will be ruled in justice to all by those who are
                        the friends of justice, while the authors or war and its appalling
                        desolation will be made aliens and strangers to the government they sought
                        to overthrow in blood.</p>
                    <p>We are not entirely without hope that the South will see the inevitable
                        result of further resistance to the popular will, and that they will yet
                        yield to the logical results of their own wanton war. If a single State
                        shall take the step, there are few that would not follow, and it is still
                        possible that another month may witness the South aiding substantially in
                        the complete restoration of the Union. We earnestly trust that they may; but
                        if they shall still refuse, then must reconstruction begin and go on to its
                        completion without the aid, counsel or regard for the interests of traitors.
                        The work will be thorough, and to this great task Congress will address
                        itself without delay. It has the clearly expressed verdict of the People to
                        guide it, and it cannot err in obedience thereto.</p>

<b>A Hint To Col. Forney</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Although Col. Forney "is a great leader," explain the editors, he enjoys
                    limited public support for his bid to become Senator. Consequently, they avow,
                    he should halt his attacks on those Republicans who have advocated instructing
                    their representatives on how to vote in the Senatorial contest, and acknowledge
                    that the push for reform has in no way affected his candidacy.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Col. Forney is a candidate for U. S. Senator. It is known by his own formal
                        announcement in the opening of the late campaign, rather than by any
                        demonstrations in his favor. Of the instructions "spoken at the ballot-boxes
                        in October," of which he speaks in a late churlish review of the Franklin
                        Senatorial Convention, not one Senator or Representative is counted as
                        elected for Forney. In his own city the two Republican Senators and thirteen
                        Representatives canvass every competing name but his. Those who mean to obey
                        the wishes of their constituents will vote for Gov. Curtin. Those who make
                        legislation a trade will vote for Simon Cameron. Those who want to defraud
                        their constituents and would divide their wrong with others, find ready
                        sympathy and aid in the Press. It is made to
                        assist in alienating legislators from the sympathies of their people, and
                        when that task is performed, the man who bought Col. Forney's Senatorial
                        laurels in 1857, swoops down upon Forney's unfinished work and gathers in
                        the harvest.</p>
                    <p>Col. Forney is a great leader. He swung Mr. Buchanan into the Presidency--we
                        do not explain how; it was done successfully. He aided in the revolution of
                        1860, although voting against both Curtin and Lincoln, and thereafter has
                        been a host in every great struggle. Intrepid and singularly able as a
                        journalist, and rarely equalled on the stump, he has done much for, and
                        deserves well of, his country. He should to-day be the towering Warwick of
                        the Republican party, and would be but for the fact that his advent into the
                        organization was heralded by the acceptance of its richest emoluments, and
                        his forgetfulness of the old adage that he who pleads his own case has a
                        fool for a client. Instead of being the Warwick of Republicanism, he is
                        shorn by the syren embrace of ambition until he is the toy of all who are
                        entered for the Senatorial race. Franklin county exercises an inherent right
                        and expresses a preference for Senator. It is not for Forney, and Forney
                        opens his columns to the anonymous complaints of those whom the people
                        discarded and espouses their cause in a leader. They are "respectable;" they
                        are "entitled to belief and political credit," declares the Press. One asserted that not five hundred
                        Republicans had participated in our instructions, and therefore they were
                        farcical. Another, whose scurrility was wisely denied admission, declared
                        that eight hundred and eight voters had participated, (more than usually
                        participate in the nominations of our most important tickets,) and therefore
                        the people had no hand in it, and Forney pulls chestnuts out of the fire for
                        the sore-heads while they bear to Cameron the fruits of Forney's labors.</p>
                    <p>It is true, as stated by the Press, that but few
                        districts have followed the example of the Republicans of Franklin, but for
                        a reason that Col. Forney prefers to overlook. We do not know of any other
                        county where the Representative procured the cordial support of the whole
                        party by his voluntary pledge that he would gladly obey instructions made
                        after the election. In accordance with that plighted faith of the one they
                        honored and charged with most important duties, their committee, in the
                        fullest meeting ever held, called a convention with a single dissenting
                        vote, and rarely, if ever, have the Republicans of the county more generally
                        participated in the election of delegates to any nominating convention; and
                        this, too, notwithstanding the fact that in many of the districts enough men
                        could not be found opposed to Gov. Curtin to make up a delegate ticket. The
                        few men who have made Forney war upon and misrepresent the Republicans of
                        Franklin county, left no means untried to defeat instructions, and wherever
                        they could find footing for an effort they called out a large vote and were
                        beaten, with the exception of a single district.</p>
                    <p>The Senatorial Convention of Franklin was a fair and emphatic expression of
                        the voice of the Republicans of the county, and he who wars upon it wars
                        upon the Republican organization. It is the voice of the Republican People,
                        made by their highest tribunal, with all the ceremony of established usage
                        and political law. It was made because our Representative invited it by his
                        pledge, and because the People wished to make it. They wish the next U. S.
                        Senator to be a true, faithful and competent man. They wish him to be the
                        choice of the Republican People, and not the offspring of corruption and
                        purchase. They wish the historic names of Lebo, Maneer and Wagonseller to
                        stand alone in their shame in the history of our legislators, and for that
                        reason they have, in the exercise of their supreme authority, declared who
                        of their many noble champions they deemed most worthy to wear their highest
                        honors, and discharge their most important trust.</p>
                    <p>Wounded ambition--ever a dangerous counselor--and weakness and venality may
                        cavil at such action of the People, but those who do it show a remnant of
                        reason by keeping it as far from the Republicans of Franklin as possible.
                        Every Republican, no matter what are his opinions, who has the manliness to
                        give his name, has free access to these columns to give publicity to his
                        views upon any subject relating to the interests or policy of the Republican
                        party. It is the party of free discussion, of honest conviction and of
                        independent action, and it tolerates everything but the spirit of defeated
                        faction that rebels against the decisions of its accepted tribunals. It
                        expresses its opinions freely and fearlessly, and accepts the sacred
                        admonition of the lamented Lincoln, so to act that "government of the
                        People, by the People and for the People shall not perish from the
                    earth!"</p>
