                <summary>In the time since the end of the war, scores of books about the conflict
                    have been written. Most of these studies, however, are less than accurate and
                    "fall far below the standard of history." The diary of J. B. Jones, the article
                    contends, is both an exception and an example. In spite of its "palpable and
                    often ludicrous errors, Jones's work, which provides an inside view of the
                    working of the rebel machinery of government," is a "valuable" contribution to
                    the continuously expanding literature on the late war.</summary>

                <transcript>
                    <p>The Union party of Pennsylvania is about to enter a political struggle that
                        is fraught with the most momentous results. It is invincible in power, but
                        fearfully imperiled by treachery. If met fairly by its opponents, its
                        triumph will be overwhelming--never before so decisive, but if it falters
                        before the blandishments of power or seeks to save honors and emoluments at
                        the sacrifice of principles, it will inevitably be defeated. Be it
                        understood in the start that President Johnson has fully determined to
                        exhaust his official power and patronage to secure the success of a
                        Democratic Governor, Democratic Congressmen, and a Democratic legislature,
                        and he will persist in his purpose unless his cowardice prevails over his
                        perfidy, as it did in Connecticut.</p>
                    <p>The sole safety of the Union party is in its inflexible devotion to its
                        principles. They are so well defined that he who runs may read. They have
                        been created by the country's perils, maintained in the nation's darkest
                        hours, baptized on an hundred battle-fields, and now in what should be the
                        day of safety of the Republic, they are assailed by traitors and their old,
                        persistent apologists and sympathizers, by the old war cry of treason for
                        peace. We have won peace--won it by the sword, the chosen arbiter of
                        traitors. They bowed to the authority of the government only when they were
                        powerless to add more to their work of murder and desolation. They yielded
                        not from sympathy, but from inexorable necessity, and now would, by the aid
                        of Northern Clymers, and Vallandighams, and Seymours, assume to wield the
                        destiny of the government they inherently hate, and clothe treason with the
                        highest honors and power. They seek not to build up, but to complete the
                        work of destruction that they attempted by four years of bloody, desperate
                        conflict; and if they shall regain their power, their highest hopes will be
                        realized.</p>
                    <p>To accomplish this fearful work, the President, chosen by loyal people to
                        secure to the nation the full fruition of the triumph of our arms, is
                        lending his whole energies. Once given over to the whispers of ambition and
                        devoted to the cause of his own and his country's foes, there is no hope to
                        be entertained that he will relent in behalf of right. The rebels, whose
                        treason he declared must be made infamous, are now his friends, and
                        therefore he invites them to seats in Congress, and Clymer and his
                        supporters respond to the appeal by declaring that disloyal men and
                        blood-stained traitors must rule the nation they failed to destroy by
                        causeless war. On the other hand Gen. Geary declares that the Republic
                        rescued by loyal blood and loyal sacrifices must be ruled by loyal men; that
                        treason is a crime that must be made odious, must have an adequate penalty,
                        and cease to be known in our land save in its crimsoned history, and with
                        him are the loyal millions who saved the nation when treason was attacking
                        its life and copperheads denying its power to preserve its existence.</p>
                    <p>There can be no mistaking the issues. We do not fear that politicians will
                        not understand the grave questions to be determined; but they must
                        understand that the consistent maintenance of the right will be in defiance
                        of every possible appeal to cupidity and weak ambition. Honors and profits
                        will be bartered from door to door to tempt men from their fidelity, and
                        there is but one course of safety to the Union party and to the nation and
                        that is to defy power with the dignity and fidelity of manhood. If this
                        shall be done, as we have every reason to believe it will, there is no
                        combination that can give victory to wrong. The people have suffered and
                        sacrificed too much to give honor and power to existing traitors and thus
                        insure the creation of a new flood of treason to cloud the land with
                        mourning. They mean to be true and faithful to their priceless inheritance
                        of Freedom. They mean to reap the full fruits of the overthrow of
                        oppression, the fruitful parent of discord and death, and they must be
                        deceived, betrayed, defrauded if they shall by their votes give victory to
                        the relentless foes of the country.</p>
                    <p>Friends of Union, Freedom and Justice!--the perils of to-day are no less than
                        when treason threatened our capital with hostile armies. The same men who
                        led the battalions of crime to destroy the capital are now thundering at its
                        doors to gain admittance as law-makers. They still have possession of the
                        rebellious States, and with them and their rulers Freedom is a byword and a
                        reproach. They must be overthrown in this new and not less deadly assault
                        upon the life of the nation, or we shall have resisted treason in the field
                        in vain. Be forewarned and thus forearmed. The foe is sleepless and will
                        labor with a heroism worthy of a better cause. Let the Union men not
                        sacrifice their sacred principles for want of corresponding effort. Let the
                        work of organization be commenced promptly in every district, and prosecuted
                        untiringly until it is accomplished. Let information be placed within the
                        reach of every man. The more thoroughly the people are educated on the great
                        issues to be decided, the more decisive will be their verdict for Freedom.
                        No man should wait for his neighbor; none wait to be invited or urged to the
                        work. It must be done, and well done, if we would forever settle the
                        question whether the faithful friends or the implacable foes of the
                        government shall administer it. We hope to see Geary clubs in every township
                        in Southern Pennsylvania within the next sixty days, and the villages should
                        all be thus organized in half that time. Let the decks be at once cleared
                        for action, and henceforth let every Union man spare no honorable effort to
                        crush out in hopeless despair, the efforts of traitors and perfidious rulers
                        to betray the government just saved by the matchless heroism, devotion and
                        sacrifices of twenty millions of faithful people.</p>

                    to explain "his stupendous folly of the 22nd of February," when he spoke before
                    ex-rebels and rebel sympathizers, praising them for their efforts during the
                    war. Yet, the piece explains, the appeals, which were "but third-rate copperhead
                    speeches, full of petty special pleading, and contemptible disregard of truth
                    and fairness," did little to quell the mounting criticism of the President.</summary>

                    <p>COURT PROCEEDINGS.--The second week of the term commenced on Monday,
                        continuing up to noon on Friday, when the courts of Common Pleas and Quarter
                        Sessions were adjourned over the regular Orphans' Court in June next. The
                        following is our report of the proceedings:</p>
                    <p>IN EQUITY.</p>
                    <p>Jacob Wister, et. al., vs. The School Directors of Antrim township. Bill in
                        Equity, setting forth that the respondents, without authority of law, levied
                        and assessed a bounty tax to be paid by the complainants and others,
                        citizens of Antrim township, to pay certain bounties to volunteers in excess
                        of the amount authorized by the acts of Assembly of the 25th of March and
                        the 25th of August, 1864. The respondents claim that the levy and assessment
                        was authorized by the act of the 8th of March, 1865. An injunction had been
                        allowed, restraining the respondents from the collection of the tax levied
                        and assessed, until after the case could be heard by the court.</p>
                    <p>The acts of March and August, 1864, authorized the levy and assessment of
                        $300 bounty for each volunteer, but when Antrim township sought to fill her
                        quota under the call of September, 1864, it was ascertained that recruits
                        could not be obtained for less than five hundred dollars. To raise the funds
                        necessary for the payment of the excess, it was first proposed to procure
                        the money by voluntary contributions, but it was soon discovered that but
                        little money could be realized in this way. Meetings were then held and it
                        was determined to raise the requisite amount by advancements or loans by the
                        citizens, on condition that they were to be repaid if the Legislature
                        legalized the proceedings. Committees were appointed to canvass the township
                        for subscriptions to the loan, and petitions to the Legislature for the
                        proposed act were to be circulated at the same time, but on the assurance of
                        Col. M'Clure, the member at the time, that the act would be passed, this was
                        not done. This was prior to the 19th of December, 1864. Geo. Eyster, Esq.,
                        was appointed Examiner, who took a mass of testimony and reported the facts
                        to the court, which are substantially as we have stated them, however
                        briefly, in this report of the proceedings.</p>
                    <p>On the 8th of March, 1865, the proposed act was passed, in which it was
                        provided that "all loans made in good faith for the payment of the excess of
                        two hundred dollars to each recruit, are hereby legalized and the same shall
                        be paid out of the tax hereby authorized to be collected."</p>
                    <p>The complainants contend that the money which it is proposed to refund out of
                        these taxes were not <emph rend="italic">loans</emph>, but gratuities or
                        donations, and therefore not within the meaning of the Act of Assembly. This
                        position, as well as the collateral points connected with it, were
                        maintained by the counsel for the complainants and combatted by the counsel
                        for the respondents with marked ability. An entire day, Monday, was devoted
                        to the argument, the case being opened by Rowe for the complainants, argued
                        by Stenger and McClure for the respondents, and closed by Sharpe for
                        complainants.</p>
                    <p>After hearing the case, it was ordered, adjudged and decreed by the Court,

                        they were proceeding to assess, demand and receive, be and the same is

                    <p>COMMON PLEAS.</p>
                    <p>William B. Leas and wife vs. James R. Brewster.--Feigned Issue, framed to
                        test the validity of a deed conveying one-half of a farm in Metal township,
                        belonging to the heirs of Mrs. Mary Gettys. Mary Gettys had made a Will, in
                        which, besides some other bequests to individuals, she gives the bulk of her
                        property to the Boards of Foreign missions and of Education of the
                        Presbyterian church, but dying before thirty days had expired after the
                        execution of the will, these bequests became nugatory. When Mrs. Gettys died
                        she was possessed of a considerable sum of money in gold and silver, and
                        there being a large premium upon specie at the time, a question arose on its
                        distribution, and it was believed necessary to contest the will in order to
                        settle the question. Mr. Brewster entered into an agreement in writing with
                        the plaintiff to contest the will, at his own expense, in consideration of
                        the plaintiffs paying him $50 out of the personal estate. It was afterward
                        ascertained that the conveyance embraced the real as well as the personal
                        estate, and the question was whether it was obtained in fraud. Verdict for
                        the plaintiff. Kimmell for Plff.; Sharpe for defendant.</p>
                    <p>Ephraim Shank vs. William Fleagle and others, School Directors of Quincy

                        $90. The plaintiff, who was the collector of the School tax of Quincy
                        township for the year 1856, brought a suit before Esquire Davison for
                        $90--tax which he alleged was overpaid. The defendants alleged the amount in
                        controversy was over one hundred dollars and plaintiff took a <emph

                        defendant did fail to comply with the stipulations contained in the article
                        of agreement, and this action was brought to recover the penalty. Verdict
                        for plaintiff for $500. Adams and Sharpe for plff.; Kimmell for deft.</p>

                <summary>Reports on an attempted robbery that was thwarted by Dr. J. L. Suesserott
                    last Saturday evening. Sueserrott happened upon the assailants as they were in
                    the process of robbing Benjamin Shoffner as he traveled along the turnpike near
                    Shetter's Woods. After much wrangling, Suesserott managed to bring the men to
                    Chambersburg where they were arrested and placed in jail to await trial. Both
                    men are "strollers, and had with them in their excursions two women and four
                    small children, the smallest of which was with them at the time they committed
                    the robbery."</summary>

                <summary>It is reported that Wesley McCleary, from Little Cove, Franklin county, was
                    arrested at Dan Rice's Circus in Greencastle last Monday and charged with
                    passing counterfeit notes on the National Bank of Indianapolis. McCleary was
                    conveyed to Chambersburg that night where he was placed in jail to await trial.
                    Evidently McCleary is associated with a group of counterfeiters led by Sam
                    Seyler, who was released from jail about a year ago, having served time for the
                    same offense. Seyler was arrested the same night in Upton by Constable Harper,
                    who shot the counterfeiter after he resisted the officer's attempts to place him
                    in custody.</summary>
