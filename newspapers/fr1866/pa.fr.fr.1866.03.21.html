<b>President Johnson's Pledge</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Employing extracts from Andrew Johnson's earlier speeches, the editors

<b>Now and Then</b><br> (Column 8)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article includes two extracts from the New York World that document the
                    about-face that the Democratic journal has done since President Johnson vetoed
                    the Freedmen's Bill. In contrast to its earlier statements concerning Johnson,
                    which characterized him as an "insolent, drunken brute," recent stories in the
                    World describe the President in a more flattering light, praising his
                    "intrepidity, sagacity and moderation."<br>

<b>Progress in Washington</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Since the tumult that followed Johnson's veto of the Freedmen's Bill, and
                    the Presidential speech of the February 22nd, the political climate has calmed
                    somewhat, contend the editors. Although Johnson has not done enough to restore
                    the "unbounded faith" they once had in him, the editors express the hope that he
                    will ultimately "redeem himself by seeking the confidence of the Union men of
                    the country." The true test, they assert, will be his position on the Civil
                    Rights bill.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Things wear rather a better aspect in Washington. A healthier tone prevails
                        throughout the different branches of the government. Congress has been firm,
                        and the people have given it unmistakeable evidence of earnest support. New
                        Hampshire has defied the combined powers of an apostate Executive and a
                        Democracy encouraged to desperation thereby, and a painful, uncertain calm
                        has followed the storm of the veto and the Presidential speech of the 22d
                        ult. The role of Cromwell and the long Parliament, which has been studied in
                        the White House and rehearsed by every rebel in and out of Congress seems to
                        be postponed without day, and even the Civil Rights bill is likely to
                        receive the executive approval, notwithstanding the grave assurances in the
                        recent veto that no legislation should be enacted affecting the rebel
                        States, until their representatives participated in its enactment. We notice
                        that since the terrible storm of the 22d ult., when the hearts of
                        secessionists and rebels were cheered by positive assurance of sympathy and
                        co-operation on the part of the President, no speeches have been made, save
                        a few unmeaning remarks in answer to proffers of support from the rebel
                        corporation of Georgetown, the copperheads of Pennsylvania and other like
                        wayward sisters in search of a resting place. A proposition to commit the
                        President to the support of Clymer aroused his smothered vexation, and he
                        dismissed them without an invitation, more positive than courteous, to go
                        home and change their nomination, and the Democracy of Rhode Island so doubt
                        the value of the Presidential elephant they supposed they had won, since the
                        thunder of the people has reached them from New Hampshire, that they threw
                        up their hand and retired from the field without even making nominations.
                        The rebels of the South, in the mean time, have been flinging their insolent
                        demands into the face of the President they deemed debauched to suit their
                        purposes, until no man with a plausible pretence of loyalty can longer
                        sustain them; and thus from every side the returning surges of the
                        tempestuous flood of passion of the 22d ult., have come heavily laden with
                        shame to their unfortunate author.</p>
                    <p>We do not from these significant facts renew, in any measure, our once
                        unbounded faith in Andrew Johnson; but we are not without some hope that
                        between the unflattering fidelity of Congress and the people, and the
                        unblushing insolence of blood-stained traitors, some good may yet result
                        from his administration. If so, none will be more hearty in awarding a just
                        need of praise than this journal. The star of hope of the Republic to-day is
                        in the now well tested integrity of the People. It is a fact established and
                        patent as well to a President as to the most casual observer of events, that
                        no measure of patronage, no degree of plausible and skilful treachery, can
                        make them for a moment forget the high and holy duty they owe to the
                        patriotic living and to the martyred dead of the Nation; and the President
                        has done well to pause while he has yet an opening to retrace his steps to
                        usefulness if not to confidence. If he shall approve the Civil Rights bill,
                        a synopsis of which is given in to-day's paper, he will squarely recede from
                        the most offensive position assumed in his recent veto of the Freedmen's
                        Bureau bill, and he will win the honor of calling upon himself the bitter
                        denunciation of every rebel and sympathiser in the land. If he shall once
                        attain that point of self-respect again, there may be some hope for Andrew
                        Johnson, and while he cannot redeem the fame he so wantonly dimmed, he can
                        still do much for a country that has done so much for him.</p>
                    <p>In this progress toward right, power has, we apprehend, done more than
                        conviction. It was no ill gust of passion that made a President assume in a
                        wild, incoherent speech, that he was all powerful in regulating the great
                        losses now being agitated. His low personal assaults upon distinguished
                        statesmen who had aided to elevate him to the highest position in the world,
                        were harmless, save as they recoiled with terrible power upon the author;
                        and in dignity and silence the intended victims have seemed unconscious of
                        them. But the foolish boast of power that pervaded the speech of the
                        President, called into action the true, lawful power of the government. With
                        becoming dignity, and with a consciousness of supreme power in the premises,
                        the popular branch of Congress answered back the threats of Executive
                        usurpations, by a solemn declaration that no State lately in rebellion
                        should be admitted to representation until Congress had, by law, pronounced
                        it entitled to full fellowship. This shivered the slashing lance of Andrew
                        Johnson. There were no back-sliders on the vote. As firm as adamant stood
                        the Union phalanx. He could proclaim Tennessee and other States in the Union
                        a thousand times; but a faithful Congress could abide by its constitutional
                        functions and Tennessee would still be out. The son-in-law of the President,
                        Judge Patterson, who has been a rebel Judge and taken the rebel oath of
                        allegiance, would still be denied a seat in the Senate, to which he has been
                        elected by the Tennessee legislature; and thus the idle, impassioned words
                        of the intended usurper, passed for naught. Power--real, legitimate power,
                        confronted the policy of a bewildered Executive, and there has been a calm
                        in the White House that gives some promise of fidelity in the government.</p>
                    <p>We have hitherto judged Andrew Johnson by his acts, censuring regretfully and
                        praising gladly, and we shall do so still. We would not mislead faithful men
                        by any assurance that he will yet do well, but it is evident that his
                        predetermined apostasy has not been grateful to him in its fruits. Whether
                        he will now attempt to redeem himself by seeking the confidence of the Union
                        men of the country, or whether he will renew his once rapid strides to the
                        deeper depths of infamy, is a problem that he alone can solve. He has now
                        learned that he cannot take with him in his apostasy the people who have
                        redeemed the Republic by their sacrifices, and the bitter lesson has been
                        brought home to him also, that his name identified with the cause of the
                        Democracy but insures their decisive defeat. He is therefore without a
                        party, a political wanderer, with none to do him reverence but the traitor
                        who basks in his clemency; and but for the destiny of a great Nation
                        committed measurably to his keeping, he would be more pitied than hated. As
                        the light breaks dimly over the dark cloud of his perfidy, let us wait for
                        its noon-tide effulgence or its starless gloom.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>ORPHAN'S COURT AND ADJOURNED COMMON PLEAS.--On Tuesday and Wednesday of last
                        week, Judge King and his associates held the regular March Orphans' Court,
                        and an adjourned session of the Common Pleas. Nothing of a special public
                        interest transpired in the Orphans' Court, but some interesting stated cases
                        were disposed of in the Common Pleas, affecting the votes of deserters at
                        elections and the Township Bounty Laws as they are commonly called. The
                        first case was that of Henry Reilly vs. Benjamin Huber. Mr. Huber was judge
                        of the election for the township of Hamilton and refused the vote of the
                        plaintiff, on the ground that he was disfranchised by the law of Congress,
                        being a deserter from the draft. The court entered judgment for the
                        plaintiff for one dollar and costs.</p>
                    <p>The other case was William Zumbro vs. Guilford township. The plaintiff in
                        this case was drafted under the last call for troops, reported and was
                        mustered into the service. The Directors of Guilford township shortly
                        afterwards passed a resolution agreeing to levy a tax sufficiently large to
                        give each drafted man who either put in a substitute or went into the
                        service himself three hundred and fifty dollars. The tax was never laid. The
                        plaintiff claims to recover under the acts of Assembly of this Commonwealth,
                        and under the action of the board of School Directors. Judgement was entered
                        for the plaintiff for three hundred and fifty dollars to bear interest from
                        date of judgement and costs. Another case stated of interest was disposed
                        of, wherein the administrators of John Sleichter, dec'd, sought to recover
                        the value of gold and silver coin upon a note given by Elizabeth and Samuel
                        Lehman. The note was dated the 16th day of March, A. D. 1859, and was for
                        nine hundred dollars, of which three hundred dollars were payable in
                        Chambersburg Bank bills, three hundred dollars in gold and three hundred
                        dollars in silver coin. It was stipulated that if the Court was of opinion
                        that the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover, judgement should be
                        entered for $636,30, which was done. All these cases will be likely to go to
                        the Supreme Court, and our readers shall be informed of the decisions of
                        that learned body.</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Challenging the "unwarranted attack" upon the character of John M. Gilmore
                    by the correspondent of the Harrisburg Telegraph, the article vigorously denies
                    the claim that the clerk to the Board of Appraisers sympathised with the men who
                    "applied the torch to Chambersburg." Though a Democrat, Gilmore, like Steven
                    Douglas, "earnestly supported the war, and to-day is one of the most determined
                    in his denunciation of the leaders of the rebellion and in demanding their
                    punishment."<br>
