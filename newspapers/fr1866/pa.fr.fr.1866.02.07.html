<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article details the various laws passed in Pennsylvania during the
                    Revolutionary era that restricted the rights of those individuals who maintained
                    their loyalty to the King, including a number of severe measures whose

<b>Negro Suffrage</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In spite of the claims made by Democratic senators, explain the editors,
                    the Union (Republican) Party does not support universal suffrage rights
                    unconditionally. Determining suffrage qualifications, they note, is the province
                    of the state governments, not the general government. The District of Columbia,
                    however, presents a different issue. As the sole legislative power of the
                    District, Congress has the right to enact laws it deems best suited to serve the
                    people's interest, including enfranchising blacks.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>There is a studious and earnest effort on the part of the opposition to the
                        Union party, to make the Union platform to suit themselves. They are
                        particularly desirous that we should adopt as a cardinal principle of our
                        creed that universal suffrage must be made the policy in all the States
                        lately in rebellion, and, the wish being father to the thought, they insist
                        that such is the purpose of the Union party in the exercise of its power.
                        This intense desire of the opposition to make the Union platform embrace the
                        idea of universal negro suffrage, was manifested in every speech made in the
                        State Senate last week by the Democratic leaders, on the question of
                        instructing our Senators on the bill enfranchising the negroes in the
                        District of Columbia. Notwithstanding the fact that the resolutions of
                        Senator Landon did not adopt the principle of enforcing the enfranchisement
                        of the negro in the rebel States, and that no Union Senator advocated the
                        unconditional enfranchisement of that race, the Democratic leaders discussed
                        the proposition solely with reference to the policy of universal
                        suffrage--just the issue that was not before the
                        Senate either directly or indirectly.</p>
                    <p>The question of regulating suffrage is, by the consent of all parties,
                        committed to the States. True, there are individual exceptions to the rule;
                        but no party organization exists in this country that proposes to
                        enfranchise the blacks in any State by the action of the general government.
                        Mr. Sumner would do so if he could give success to the measure; but the
                        Union party of the House has distinctly defined its position on the question
                        by the adoption of a proposed amendment to the constitution, and it is
                        understood that the Senate will endorse the action of the House at an early
                        day. By this amendment, if adopted, the question of suffrage is clearly left
                        to the States--the States lately in rebellion as well as the loyal States;
                        but it provides with obvious justice, "that whenever the elective franchise
                        shall be denied or abridged in any State on account of race or color, all
                        persons of such race or color shall be excluded from the basis of
                        representation." If the Union men of Congress meant to enforce negro
                        enfranchisement by the power of the general government, they would not have
                        united on an amendment in express terms allowing States to limit or deny
                        suffrage to any class, and to enlarge or diminish their representation by
                        their action on the subject.</p>
                    <p>The proposition to confer the right of suffrage upon the negroes in the
                        District of Columbia is a very different issue from that of enforcing their
                        enfranchisement in the States. Congress is the sole legislative power of the
                        District of Columbia. It can enfranchise or disfranchise as may be deemed
                        best for the interests of the people, and there can be no question as to the
                        constitutionality of the power exercised. The power of Congress there is
                        just equal with the power of the people in the several States, acting
                        through their properly constituted authorities. It is, therefore, solely a
                        question of municipal regulation, and the right of suffrage does not go
                        beyond the mere local or municipal government. The people of the district do
                        not vote for legislators, Congressmen or President, and the voice of the
                        enfranchised negro cannot be heard beyond the regulation of his own property
                        and security. The whites of the District had been, and still are,
                        confessedly disloyal. They had rendered more aid to the rebel cause than any
                        State in rebellion. A large proportion of their men went into the rebel
                        army, and their families, with many of the more cowardly men, remained
                        behind to aid by treachery the cause of the foes of the Republic. These
                        adventurers have returned to the fellowship and sympathy of the people of
                        the capital, and but recently one of the rebel heroes was elected to an
                        important municipal office in Georgetown. The negroes number some thousands
                        of citizens, who are taxed for the support of schools and local government,
                        but enjoy but few advantages. They have many schools and churches of their
                        own, sustained by their own contributions, and the conviction is
                        irresistible that their enfranchisement would infuse at least a shade of
                        loyalty in the government of the capital of the Nation. Congress has
                        therefore justly decided to make them voters, and we hope that the Senate
                        will concur in this measure.</p>
                    <p>Regarding the question as one of purely local or municipal character, we
                        think that Senator Hall was right in denying the propriety of legislative
                        instructions on the subject. As well might the legislature instruct as to
                        any other local or police regulations of the District of Columbia, when the
                        question of suffrage was not a national one. Pennsylvania does not confer
                        suffrage upon negroes, and the question is precluded from the list of vital
                        issues at this time by the provisions of our constitution forbidding
                        amendments oftener than once in five years. The issue is not, therefore, a
                        national one, nor is it a State issue, and being but a municipal question,
                        effecting only the local government of the District of Columbia, the
                        legislature wisely, we think, dismissed the subject. We believe that no
                        Union Senator questioned either the expediency or the justice of the action
                        of Congress; but it would be equally competent for the Pennsylvania
                        legislature to instruct Virginia or Massachusetts as to their local policy
                        as to instruct on municipal questions in the District.</p>
                    <p>We do not regret the discussion of the question in the Senate of
                        Pennsylvania. It was an able debate, and must produce wholesome results. No
                        man could hear the impressive and eloquent speeches of Landon, Bigham,
                        Brown, Hall and others, without feeling that the loyalty of this entire
                        government must and will be ensured at any and every hazard. The South will
                        have the option to obey or disobey; to be faithful or faithless; and if they
                        shall repay the magnanimity of the government by persistent efforts to
                        destroy by perfidy what they failed to destroy by the sword, they will be
                        hurled from power and the loyal men, without regard to caste or color, will
                        win rebellious States to the loyal ranks again. Differ as statesmen may in
                        their theories as to the status of the rebellious States, they all agree
                        that they have no rights which will protect treason, and the extension of
                        suffrage to the emancipated negro in the District of Columbia is an
                        admonition that where treason rules in treason, there is a remedy, and it
                        will be applied until Justice and Freedom shall be fully vindicated.</p>

<b>The Progress of Justice</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Thad Stevens introduced a bill last Wednesday that would mandate a
                    reduction in the basis of representation for states in which individuals are
                    denied their suffrage rights "on account of race or color." Though "the
                    amendment was adopted by the decisive vote of 120 to 46," according to the
                    article, the proposed legislation met spirited opposition from both Democrats,
                    who asserted it would "weaken the political power of treason in Congress," and
                    Radical Republicans, who claimed it "ignores the issue of enfranchising the

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>
                        To the Editors of the Franklin Repository:
                    </p>
                    <p>I have looked in vain for frequent articles on this subject in our county
                        papers, and feel disappointed in seeing so little reference made to it. I
                        hope it is not indicative of a feeling of indifference on the part of the
                        community to a matter that addresses itself to every class with so much
                        force.</p>
                    <p>The only objection which I have yet heard against giving liberally towards
                        the location of a Normal School in our midst, is, that it is designed merely
                        to educate teachers for common schools, and hence
                        would not be of any advantage to us in the way of educational facilities
                        generally.</p>
                    <p>Now if this were so, surely the Normal School should be hailed by every one
                        most heartily even on this score alone. Will it not, even in a financial point of view, be a desirable movement,
                        to bring from 500 to 800 pupils, with Professors and Teachers into our
                        midst, who will spend thousands of dollars in our stores, workshops,
                        &amp;c.?* Every merchant, every hotel keeper, every mechanic and
                        artisan, and every farmer, will be benefitted,
                        directly and indirectly, by the location of the institution among us. But it
                        is not correct, that a Normal School is and must be exclusively only for
                        those who wish to be trained as teachers. There
                        is no reason why such a school should not be an institution of a very high order in all the branches of a liberal
                        and thorough education--both male and female. And if our community shall
                        offer sufficient inducements in the way of subscriptions to secure its
                        location here, I incline to the belief, as I do most heartily hope and
                        desire, that it will be one that will do honor to the cause of education
                        generally, and reflect creditably upon the district and the county in which
                        it shall be located. If its Trustees will select the proper man as its head--a man of enlarged mind, liberal views and
                        established reputation--we may be well assured, that the institution will be
                        established upon such a basis, that it will comment itself to the patronage,
                        not only of persons seeking a training as teachers, but others who desire to
                        prepare themselves for professional or business pursuits.</p>
                    <p>I am aware, that in the Teacher's Seminaries in
                        Europe--at least those in Prussia and the German States generally--only
                        those are admitted who have the office of teaching as their profession in
                        view; and it must be admitted, that they make thorough work of it, both as
                        regards the theory and the practice of teaching. But we are not yet quite
                        prepared for that. We shall do well if we keep at some little distance from
                        their standard. But we should certainly aim at something higher than we have
                        hitherto had. A year or two of teaching to many
                        of those who are to be the future teachers of our
                        children, will be of vast benefit. But along with this, we can make such
                        institutions tell beneficially upon all classes of youth in the community,
                        and thus bring the benefits of a classical, or at least higher than ordinary school education within the reach of very
                        many.</p>
                    <p>Will we, then, not have the Normal School located in our midst? Shall others
                        reap the benefits of it rather than we--we, who need it, just now, more than
                        any of our neighbors, having suffered the loss of our beautiful Academy and
                        the best part of our town? Ought we not have it,
                        both as an educational and financial interest?</p>
                    <p>If it were not that just the very class of citizens in our town, who would be
                        foremost in such an enterprise, have to a great extent been crippled in
                        their means, I am sure that our town alone would furnish from $15,000 to
                        $20,000 for this object. Still, they will do what they
                            can. I hear of one generous-hearted citizen--perhaps there are
                        more--offering to give one thousand, and others
                            five hundred dollars. Have we not a score or
                        two of well to do farmers, who will subscribe one hundred or five hundred?
                        The interest of the latter sum would be thirty
                        dollars. If he has a son to whom he wished to give a good education,
                        would he not deem it worth thirty dollars to have that son at school near home? Or, if he will look at the material side of the subject, will not the thirty
                        dollars, or at least a considerable portion of it, come back to him by a
                        means of a better home market? But even if he did
                        not realize one dollar of material profit,
                        methinks the consciousness of aiding his posterity educationally, and aiding
                        confessedly a good cause, should be a sufficient
                        motive to every man, to help forward such a noble object.<br> S.</p>
                    <p>* The outlay in board alone of 500 students per annum. at the low sum of $80
                        for each, would amount to $40,000--and this sum
                        would mainly be expended in our midst.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>ACCIDENTAL DEATH OF ISAAC HUTTON.--On Tuesday of last week, Mr. Isaac Hutton,
                        a well known and respectable citizen of this place, drove into the country
                        with his wife, on a visit to Mr. Jacob Myers, near Marion. As he was about
                        to return home, and while in the act of watering his horse, a one-year colt,
                        which was running loose in the yard, approached him. He struck at the colt
                        with his whip to frighten it away, when it kicked him in the abdomen so
                        severely that he never rallied from the effects of the kick, but died early
                        on Tuesday morning. Dr. W. J. Maxwell, from the neighborhood, and Dr.
                        Senseny, of this place, were called in, but could render no relief to the
                        unfortunate man. His only son, who lives at Bedford, was immediately
                        telegraphed for, but did not arrive until after his death. His remains were
                        brought to his late residence and interred in the cemetery of the German
                        Reformed Church on Saturday afternoon. One of the unfortunate sufferers by
                        the terrible fire which impoverished so many of our citizens, he had rebuilt
                        his house, re-established his business, and by his well-known business
                        capacity would have succeeded in retiring his heavy losses. But cut down
                        while yet in the vigor of his days, by an unforeseen accident, he leaves a
                        young widow and some small children burdened with financial responsibilities
                        which the promise of a long life induced him to undertake. It is one of the
                        most distressing consequences of our calamity, that sudden death often adds
                        anxiety for the living to sorrow for the dead. A faithful husband, a kind
                        father, a good neighbor, and an honest man, the whole community deplores his
                        loss only less grievously than those related to him by the ties of
                    kindred.</p>
