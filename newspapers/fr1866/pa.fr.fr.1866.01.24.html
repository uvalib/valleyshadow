<b>A Momentous Lesson!</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editorial celebrates the passage of the bill conferring the right of
                    suffrage to blacks in the District Columbia by Congress and argues that the law
                    has "a broader, deeper and more profound meaning than its language implies." The
                    bill "is a voice of warning" to southerners that treason will not be tolerated
                    nor will race relations in the region continue as they had before the war.<br>

<b>Shall Deserters Vote</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In light of the fact that there is much uncertainty over the
                    constitutionality of the deserter law, the editors urge the state authorities to
                    draft "proper legislation" to "regulate the qualifications of suffrage in the
                    State." Such a measure is necessary, they explain, to ensure that men who
                    refused to fight for the country in its time of need will be denied "the
                    priceless blessing of citizenship."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>This is a grave question, and it must be answered by the legislature of the
                        State. We do not assume that the act of Congress is unconstitutional; but
                        the fact is patent to every legislator that without an enactment of the
                        State clearly defining how the skulkers who deserted the army and their
                        country in the hour of peril, shall be disfranchised, it will never be
                        uniformly enforced. The fact that in nearly every Democratic county the
                        election officers were openly, and in some cases officially, by the District
                        Attorney, advised to nullify the law, and that in every precinct in the
                        State where the Democrats had the election board, such votes were welcomed,
                        regardless of the high crime of which they were confessedly guilty, and the
                        penalty imposed by solemn act of the national legislature, is an admonition
                        to the State that should not be disregarded. There are now many suits
                        pending in different parts of the State growing out of this question, and it
                        is not impossible that all of them may be determined by the Supreme Court of
                        the State and leave some vital point undecided, by which nullification will
                        continue for another year or more.</p>
                    <p>There have been two judicial decisions in such cases in the courts of common
                        pleas. Judge King decided that deserters cannot be disfranchised without
                        conviction by due process of law, and Judge Elwell in the Columbia district,
                        gave a similar decision. Judge Thompson, one of the Justices of the Supreme
                        Court, gave an opinion--not a judicial decision as there was no case before
                        him--before the last election, in which he affirmed the right of deserters
                        to vote, notwithstanding the act of Congress. The cases decided in the
                        common pleas courts will doubtless be taken to the Supreme Court; but even
                        if the points raised are decided against the right of deserters, there will
                        remain other disputed points which will be made the pretext for defying the
                        law. For instance--Judge King decides but one point out of three raised by
                        the counsel for Mr. Stenger in the case before our court, and the Supreme
                        Court will take cognizance of none but the point decided. The court of last
                        resort may thus affirm the "due process of law" of the act of Congress, and
                        reverse Judge King; and next year we shall have similar suits in court
                        defined on the ground that the act of Congress is an ex
                            post facto law as regards many deserters, or that Congress cannot
                        regulate the qualifications of suffrage in a State. Equally uncertain as to
                        the main points may be suits for damages, brought against election officers
                        either for receiving or rejecting such votes. The courts may decide that, in
                        absence of malice, there can be no responsibility in damages for either
                        alleged offence, and the validity of the law may not become a question in
                        such cases.</p>
                    <p>Whatever may be the individual views of the legislature as to the validity of
                        the act of Congress, they have this pregnant fact before them--that a solemn
                        enactment of Congress is insolently defied by a large minority of the people
                        of the State, without any judicial determination of the question, and this
                        lawlessness will be persisted in until there is proper legislation on the
                        subject by a power that is confessedly competent to regulate the
                        qualifications of suffrage in the State. In this county one of our bravest
                        and best soldiers, Col. D. Watson Rowe, is deprived of an office by the
                        votes of traitors and cowards who skulked away and denounced the government
                        while he was heroically fighting for the life of the Nation. Had the
                        deserter vote been rejected, he would have been elected by a clever
                        majority. By the same vote, Mr. Duncan held a seat in the Senate for twenty
                        days, and would have held it for three years but for the fact that he had to
                        confront a Senate that resolved all doubts in favor of obedience to the
                        laws. If it were certain that judicial decisions would settle the question
                        fully before the next election so that all must accept a common construction
                        and yield a like obedience to the law, legislation would not be necessary;
                        but there is no reason to hope that the end desired can be attained by
                        appeal to the Supreme Court. In this view of the case, we have left out of
                        consideration the possible decision of the Supreme Court against the
                        constitutionality of the law. If the court shall so decide, on any point
                        raised, then we will be without any penalty for desertion and their votes
                        must be admitted.</p>
                    <p>We earnestly commend this question to the consideration of the judiciary
                        committees of the legislature. Able lawyers are at the head of both of them,
                        and they cannot too well mature any measure they may propose. Whatever may
                        be done must be in a shape to remove all question as to the validity of the
                        act, or we shall have nullification of our State law just as we have had
                        nullification of the act of Congress. No loyal citizen will deny that the
                        man who refuses to sustain his government when it is assailed by a deadly
                        foe, is unworthy of the priceless blessing of citizenship; and if the
                        penalty can be imposed so that its enforcement shall be certain and uniform,
                        it will be but an act of justice alike to faithful men and to the Nation
                        just rescued by the heroism and sacrifices of our brave defenders.</p>

                    <p>
                        To the Editors of the Franklin Repository:
                    </p>
                    <p>What has occasioned the present high prices of almost all articles of
                        consumption? is a question frequently propounded, and generally answered at
                        least to the satisfaction of the party inquired of, if not to that of all
                        others. Whether the solution of the difficulties involved in the inquiry
                        given, is so generally based upon fact and reason, is not so certain. Many
                        of the ablest political economists of the day, have devoted the most earnest
                        attention of their disciplined and well informed minds, to discovering, and
                        elucidating the causes operating to produce, and continue the existing evil
                        of high prices, and to providing a remedy therefor. Unfortunately for the
                        suffering people, the result of their labors is far from furnishing ground
                        to hope for a speedy cessation of the distress, or the prevention of its
                        recurrence at some future period.</p>
                    <p>These economists, after having thoroughly pondered the teachings of history,
                        after having exhausted the ingenuity of their fertile and far reaching
                        minds, in searching for the causes and remedies of our financial
                        revulsions--so far prove, having discovered some great law operating
                        unceasingly, uniformly and undeviatingly, in establishing prosperity or
                        adversity in the financial condition of a country, in proportion as its
                        admonitions are regarded--so far prove all this, economists have ended their
                        labors by fabricating discordant, conflicting theories, relative to the
                        existing state of the finances, and markets of the country. If the theory of
                        one is rational, that of another must prove ruinous in practice. This is the
                        dilemma in which our statesmen are placed. If our people do not experience
                        immediate relief from their financial burdens from those they have chosen to
                        legislate for them, they must make allowances for the difficulties
                        surrounding the problem and be content to move slowly and carefully from
                        fear he might make "confusion worse confounded."</p>
                    <p>I do not propose to answer the question with which this article opens. I
                        desire merely to suggest for the consideration of your readers some facts
                        and thoughts connected with the subject that may serve, if properly
                        deliberated on, and traced through all their influences, to give them more
                        correct ideas of some of the laws of trade than many now possess, and so far
                        assist in relieving that much abused class "the speculators" held
                        responsible for all the distress occasioned the community by the present
                        inflated prices. In ruder times, when wants were fewer than they are at
                        present, it was the practice for each person to supply his wants by means of
                        barter or exchange. The cultivator of the soil bartered the produce of his
                        land with the mechanic for articles of his craft and thus all their
                        necessities were supplied. But as communities increased as wants were
                        multiplied, as property accumulated this simple mode of conversion no longer
                        equaled the requirements of society. Some representative of value was
                        necessary to facilitate the conversion of property, something easy of
                        transportation and preservation. To meet this want money was instituted or
                        created. Gold being supposed to contain more desirable qualities for the
                        purpose than any other metal was determined on as the standard of value, or
                        as the representative or as it has been called the measure of value. By
                        means of it every production of the soil, machinery or genius could be
                        exchanged for its value. But in some communities in time even this facility
                        was insufficient for the necessities of trade and commerce, or at least was
                        thought to be so. Whether in reality it was or was not is one of the mooted
                        questions which I do not propose at present to discuss.</p>
                    <p>Paper money, as the representative of gold, the standard, was introduced. It
                        was supposed to possess some advantages over gold. It was more easy of
                        transportation and safe keeping. Each dollar of paper has supposed to
                        represent a dollar of gold, hid away in the vaults of the person or
                        institution issuing the paper, to be forth coming when demanded by the
                        holder of the paper. This is money or currency based on credit or belief in
                        the ability of the issuer to redeem when thereto required. When this belief
                        exists as long as this ability to redeem in gold continues, this paper
                        currency does fulfill all the requirements of trade and conversion.</p>
                    <p>Now the liabilities of all Banking institutions consisting in part of paper
                        promises to pay and indebtedness to depositors greatly exceeding the amount
                        of gold (being often in the proportion of ten to one) really in their vaults
                        with which to redeem their liabilities. This Bank may with reason be
                        regarded as in a sound and prosperous condition. She can exhibit assets
                        amounting in the aggregate to far more than her liabilities. But of what
                        they do they consist. A large proportion of it is in the notes of
                        individuals who possess farms but no gold with which to pay their notes,
                        another portion is in the notes of other banks similarly situated, having in
                        their vaults a very small proportion of gold in comparison with their
                        liabilities, depending in fact for the redemption of this paper on the very
                        notes of the Bank first mentioned.</p>
                    <p>It frequently occurs, when importations of goods greatly exceeded in value
                        those exported from the country, that a consequent demand for gold with
                        which to pay our debt incurred abroad when our paper has no credit are
                        speedily drained of their gold, or, as they style it, in self defence in
                        violation of laws and engagement shut their vaults and refuse to pay it out
                        at all. Hence arises in the public mind the inquiries, is a paper currency a
                        safe one? To what extent its issue should be tolerated? Its effect upon the
                        markets. How guard against the abstraction of our gold to foreign countries?
                        How in a word retain the currency of the country in such a condition that a
                        paper dollar shall honestly represent and be equivalent to a dollar in gold?
                        These inquiries have perplexed the wisest finances of the age. Some of their
                        views will be given again.</p>

<b>Local Items--Court Proceedings</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>TAVERN LICENSES: A license was granted to David L. Taylor to keep a tavern
                    at his new house on the site of the old Indian Queen Hotel in Chambersburg.
                    Licenses were also granted to S. F. Greenawalt and John Miller, Chambersburg;
                    Daniel Stitzel, Marion; David Guyer, Horse Valley; A. B. Siebert and Childerson

                    township; and David Kitzmiller, Roxbury, all old stands. In view of the probable
                    increase of the population of Roxbury from the erection of the contemplated
                    Glass Works at that place, the court authorized the opening of another house
                    there and licensed Samuel Staver to keep it. ROADS, &amp; C.: The report of
                    the viewers recommending a bridge over the East Conococheague creek near David
                    Lehman's mill, in Green township, was concurred by the grand jury. The report of
                    the viewers by which part of a road in Montgomery township was vacated and
                    supplied was confirmed ni si and ordered to be opened twenty feet wide. The same
                    disposition was made of a road laid out in Lurgan township and another in Green
                    township. A petition for the review of the Lurgan township road was presented
                    and viewers appointed. Petitions were also presented for the review of two roads
                    in Guilford township, and one to vacate a private road in Southampton township,
                    and viewers appointed for each case. The report of viewers laying a road from
                    Concord to the Perry county line was confirmed ni si and ordered to be opened
                    twenty feet wide. QUARTER SESSIONS: Com. vs. Peter Williams and John

                    vs. Jacob R. Shank--Furnishing liquor to minors. A true bill. Defendant pleads
                    not guilty. Verdict not guilty; but that the defendant shall pay two-thirds of
                    the costs and the prosecutor one-third. The parties in the two foregoing cases
                    hail from near State Line. The brother of one of the defendants lately married,
                    was complimented with a "'calathumpian serenade.'" The defendants dealt out
                    cider and diluted whiskey to the serenaders, among whom were the little boys of
                    the prosecutor, and the matter was thought worthy of arbitrament of His Honor
                    and a jury. Com. vs. Jeremiah Shockey--Disturbing a religious meeting, on oath
                    of Daniel Mentzer. Not a true bill, and the prosecutor to pay costs. Com. vs.

                    Verdict, not guilty. The defendant who was quite a young boy, was charged with
                    stealing money to the amount of about $25 from Fanny Brown. The commonwealth,
                    depending mainly upon the boy's confession, which the court excluded on the
                    ground that it was improperly obtained, failed in proof. Com. vs. Henry
                    Grey--Assault and Battery on oath of Peter Snider. At true bill. Defendant
                    pleads guilty and submits. Sentenced to pay a fine of one cent to the
                    Commonwealth and undergo an imprisonment in the county jail for one calendar
                    month, to be computed from the expiration of the sentence in the larceny case.
                    Com. vs. Henry Grey--Larceny. A true bill. Defendant pleads not guilty. Verdict
                    guilty. Sentenced to pay a fine of one cent to the Commonwealth and undergo an
                    imprisonment in the county jail for two calendar months. The defendant, a young
                    colored man under the influence, as he said, of a "number of good christmas
                    gifts," stole a pair of shoes that day from a young man at Fisher's Hotel and
                    was making off with them when Peter Snider sought to arrest him and was knocked
                    down stairs for his pains by the thief, getting an arm dislocated. Com. vs.
                    Columbus Baily--Larceny. A true bill. Defendant pleads not guilty. Verdict
                    guilty. The defendant in this case stopped as a guest at Fisher's Hotel, and
                    during the night stole a quantity of clothing and jewelry. He was arrested at
                    Carlisle the next day with the goods in his possession. He was tried and
                    sentenced on Tuesday and asked the sentence to be delayed until the next
                    morning. In the early part of the evening he asked Mrs. Doebler, the wife of the
                    Sheriff, for a piece of bread for a fellow prisoner, when the prison gate was
                    opened he caught the lady violently by the throat choking her and forcing past
                    her made his escape. Immediate pursuit was made and though he was traced to
                    Greencastle, nothing further has been heard of him. A reward of twenty-five
                    dollars has been offered for his arrest. He is quite a young man and of rather
                    prepossessing appearance. Com. vs. Eli Gates--Assault and Battery. Not a true
                    bill, and Carolina Kane, the prosecutrix to pay the costs, except the $4 to the
                    county. Com. vs. Eli Gates--Two indictments, one for keeping a disorderly house
                    and one for selling liquor without a license. True bill. Defendant pleads not
                    guilty. Verdict guilty. Not sentenced. Com. vs. Frederick Jones--Assault and
                    Battery, on oath of Arthur Johnston. A true bill. Nolle prosequi entered by
                    leave of court. Com. vs. Samuel Stahl--Fornication and Bastardy. Defendant held
                    in $500, to appear at the next term to answer. Com. vs. Asrom Hambright--Public
                    Nuisance, on oath of William Berry. A true bill. Defendant pleads not guilty.
                    Verdict guilty. Sentenced to pay a fine of one dollar to the Commonwealth and
                    costs. In this case the defendant removed stones from a road in Green township,
                    somewhat to the damage of the public highway. The defence set up was that the
                    road encroached on defendant's land. Com. vs. Thomas McAfee, James McAfee, and
                    John McAfee--Receiving and concealing stolen horses. Defendants held in $500, to
                    appear at next term to answer. Com. vs. Leah Fox and Lucinda Fox--Keeping a
                    bawdy and disorderly house. Nolle prosequi entered by leave of court. Com. vs.
                    Joseph R. Winters--Assault and Battery, on oath of George Williams. A true bill.
                    Defendant pleads guilty and submits to the court. Sentenced to pay a fine of ten
                    dollars to the commonwealth and costs of prosecution. The prosecutor undertook
                    the care of the horse and buggy of defendant while he remained in the colored
                    church of this place to witness a marriage ceremony, wherein two "cullud
                    pussons" were made as one. On coming out of the church defendant found the horse
                    and buggy gone, and getting what he termed an "abrupt answer" upon inquiring,
                    administered a gentle reproof by knocking out one of the prosecutor's teeth.
                    Com. vs. Philip Smith--Arson. A true bill. Defendant pleads not guilty. Verdict,
                    not guilty on grounds of insanity. The defendant was charged with setting fire
                    to the stable of his step-mother, Mrs. Catharine Smith, in the borough, on the
                    night of the 1st of December last. He was seen applying the match by a colored
                    man, who immediately gave the alarm. The defence attempted to prove an alibi but
                    did not succeed to the satisfaction of the jury. Proof of insanity was adduced,
                    and the fact conceded by the Commonwealth. Com. vs. William LeMott--Larceny. A
                    true bill. Defendant pleads not guilty. Verdict, guilty. Sentenced to pay a fine
                    of $1 and the cost of prosecution and undergo imprisonment by separate and
                    solitary confinement, at labor, in the Eastern penitentiary, for one year and
                    one month. The defendant was charged with stealing $15 in greenbacks and one
                    Mexican silver dollar from James Wiley. Both were colored men. When arrested,
                    LeMott had on his person two dollars in greenbacks and the Mexican dollar. The
                    prosecutor stated that he obtained the silver dollar in Mexico, getting there
                    occasionally across the Rio Grande by "schemes," while in Texas, and described
                    it as having a "spranled sun" on one side. The defence attempted to prove an
                    alibi by showing by another black person that defendant was at the colored
                    church in this place, drunk early in the evening, to witness a "ceremony of
                    matrimony," and the witness thought he could not have been sober enough by one
                    o'clock to commit the theft. The jury though otherwise. COMMON PLEAS--FIRST
                    WEEK: Addison Imbrie vs. John Palsgrove--Assumpsit on a book account. No
                    defence. Verdict for plaintiff for $490. Jacob S. Lynn vs. Jacob Heisey--Appeal
                    by defendant from a Justice's judgement for $34 and an award of arbitrators for
                    $51. Verdict for plaintiff for $19. Jacob S. Brown vs. Samuel M. Worley and
                    Edward Aughinbaugh. Trover and Conversion. Jury failed to agree and were
                    discharged. Jacob Glass vs. Henry Kyle and wife--Scire Facias on a mechanic's
                    lien. Verdict for defendant for $15.33. The other cases put down for the week
                    either settled by the parties or continued by the court. The court sat late on
                    Saturday night, and only adjourned when Saturday night gave place to Sunday
                    morning.<br>(Names in announcement:  David L. Taylor,  S. F. Greenawalt,  John Miller,  Daniel Stitzel,  David Guyer,  A. B.
