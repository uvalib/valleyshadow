<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>[Phonographically reported by L. Stroup, Esq.]</p>
                    <p>May it Please the Court:--I shall not devote any
                        part of my argument to the second point raised in the paper book of the
                        Defendant in error. I do not apprehend that this learned court can decide
                        the act of Congress disfranchising deserters to be an ex
                            post facto law. Henry Reilly was regularly drafted on the 19th of
                        July, 1864, and was by the express terms of the act of Congress, subject to
                        the rules and regulations governing persons in the military service from
                        that date. He was a deserter from the day he was required to report, and
                        persisted in the crime of desertion every day and hour thereafter. On the 3d
                        of March, 1865, Congress authorized the President to relieve him from the
                        penalty--which might be death--by proclamation, if he should return within a
                        specified time and discharge the manifest duty he owed to the government,
                        and the same act provided that if he should "not return
                            to said service" within the period named, for thus repeating and persisting in the crime of desertion,
                        and rejecting the proffered pardon of the government, it pronounces upon him
                        the fearful but just judgement that he "shall be deemed and taken to have
                        voluntarily relinquished and forfeited" his great birth-right of
                        citizenship. If he offended by refusing to report originally, surely he much
                        more offended when he repeated the refusal in the face of pardon tendered
                        for the past.</p>
                    <p>STRONG J.--Does the case stated show that there was a proclamation?</p>
                    <p>MR. McCLURE--It does not.</p>
                    <p>REED J.--I suppose that this court can take notice of that.</p>
                    <p>MR. McCLURE--I think the court should take notice of a public proclamation of
                        the President, made in pursuance of law, as they would of the law itself.</p>
                    <p>The government of the United States is one of limited powers, derived
                        directly from the fountain of all power--the People. Our organic law is
                        ordained in their name, and its purposes are declared with marked
                        distinctness in the preamble. In delegating powers to the general
                        government, they made express reservations, and reversed the rule that
                        obtained in the Articles of Confederation, reserving to the States
                        limitations in the exercise of the powers delegated.</p>
                    <p>I apprehend that there is no term that is so widely misunderstood and so
                        erroneously applied, as the term "limited powers" in its application to our
                        government. For three quarters of a century our history was unmarked by any
                        great test of the powers of the national authority, and the popular fallacy
                        that our nationality was limited even in its powers of self-preservation,
                        had during that time been solemnized by partizan deliverances, maintained by
                        some of our ablest statesmen who looked to our ultimate dismemberment, and
                        entered into the education of those who were in time to become the makers
                        and expounders of our laws.</p>
                    <p>While it is confessed by all that the powers of the general government are
                        limited, it is equally true that they are not
                        limited in any sense, where they are delegated either expressly or by
                        implication, excepting the natural and proper limitations which forbid the
                        exercise of any power under the constitution to invade any right or
                        reservation of the same instrument. It stands as a monument of the sublimest
                        wisdom. It is in all things consistent with itself, and its symmetry is but
                        perfected in its administration. A careful study of the well considered
                        language of the constitution, of the exercise of the delegated powers, and
                        the uniform manner of their construction by the judicial and other
                        departments of the government, consistently define the limitation of powers
                        as distinguishing merely between the delegated and the reserved, and not in the exercise of powers delegated.</p>
                    <p>When the people created a nationality for themselves and their posterity,
                        they well understood the magnitude of their task. They had been tossed in
                        the violent throes of revolution. They had experienced the want of a
                        national sovereignty, not only before the adoption of articles of
                        confederation, but equally so thereafter. They had no nationality. Their
                        confederation but relieved the States of certain important and delicate
                        powers, and yet left with the States the power to defeat the exercise of
                        them. They therefore ordained the organic law in order to invest their
                        nationality with every essential attribute of sovereignty.</p>
                    <p>If we turn to the first step taken in framing the articles of confederation
                        and from thence to the first step taken in framing the constitution, we can
                        at once see the supreme necessity that fashioned the very foundation stone
                        of our national structure. In forming the confederation, in 1778, the first
                        article defining powers declares that "each State retains its sovereignty, freedom and independence, and every
                        power, jurisdiction and right, which is not by this confederation, expressly
                        delegated to the United States in Congress assembled:" and throughout all
                        the articles the most scrupulous care is manifested to guard against the
                        exercise of supreme or questionable powers by the general government. But
                        when the constitution was framed, the want of supreme power in the national
                        government had been learned by bitter experience--by the difficulties in
                        raising armies and maintaining credit more particularly--and the first
                        article vests all legislature powers in Congress. Another article defines
                        specific powers, including the right to raise and support armies, and closes
                        with a sweeping delegation of power to "make all laws
                            which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the
                            foregoing powers." And lest some constitutional quibbler should
                        not learn of the failure of limited powers, in the exercise of delegated
                        authority, under the confederation, and attempt to defeat the purpose of the
                        constitution by the pernicious doctrine of the supreme sovereignty of the
                        States, the concluding article provides that "this constitution and the laws
                        of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof, * * * shall be the supreme law of the land, AND THE
                        JUDGES IN EVERY STATE SHALL BE BOUND THEREBY, anything
                            in the constitution or laws of any such State to the contrary
                            notwithstanding!"</p>
                    <p>Had my learned friend (Mr. Sharpe) been living under the articles of
                        confederation, instead of the more enlightened provisions of the
                        constitution, his arguments would have been in happy accord with the
                        fundamental law; but the nation has moved on from the feeble infancy of the
                        confederation to the full manhood of a mighty nationality, supreme in its
                        powers, perfect in its attributes of sovereignty, and empowered to give
                        complete effect to all its lawful mandates. The confederation was but a
                        national suicide. Its powers were but the instruments of death in time of
                        peril. It was powerless to maintain its own existence. It could demand and
                        apportion revenues, but could not enforce collection. It was therefore
                        bankrupt. It could declare war, but could not compel military service from
                        the people. It could define offences and penalties, but could not carry its
                        laws into operation. It had no coercive authority. It could not legislate
                        directly upon persons, and many of its enactments were silently disregarded,
                        others were slowly and reluctantly obeyed, and still others were openly
                        nullified. It was, therefore, the wisdom gathered by the saddest
                        experience--an experience that well nigh lost the cause of Independence for
                        want of power to fill the shattered ranks of the patriots, and which left
                        the confederation at the close of the war without even the semblance of
                        credit, for want of power to enforce the collection of revenue--that
                        dictated the enlarged powers to the general government, and unlimited
                        authority in the exercise of any delegated power, under the constitution. In
                        short, from a mere confederation created to serve the necessities of a
                        revolution, the master-piece of Independence was left to be perfected after
                        the trials of war, by the creation of our constitution; and the controlling
                        purpose of its framers was to found a nationality that could, by the
                        exercise of its legitimate and lawful authority, defy domestic and foreign
                        foes, and maintain its own existence and the unity of the States and
                        territory committed to its supreme guardianship.</p>
                    <p>Let us turn to the great chart of our liberties as created by the fathers of
                        the Republic, and see how they conferred the attribute of sovereignty upon
                        the general government. In words as brief as they are sublime, the preamble
                        tells the whole story of the want of a supreme nationality. It says:--"We,
                        the People of the United States, in order to form a more
                            perfect Union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility,
                        provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the
                        blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish
                        this constitution for the United States of America." Their Union had been
                        imperfect, because the States possessed, under the confederation, a
                        sovereignty to which the confederation was subordinated. They, therefore,
                        declared "a more perfect Union" as the first object of the constitution, and
                        after the establishment of justice, to "insure domestic tranquility" was
                        deemed the next important duty. Discord had prevailed throughout the States
                        under the confederation, because each was the arbiter of its own rights and
                        wrongs, and prejudice and interest were ever at war with the common welfare.
                        Instead of starting out with the reserved rights of States and the
                        confession of their sovereignty, as did the articles of confederation, they
                        vested "all legislative powers herein granted" in Congress. Instead of
                        restrictions being the rule as in the confederation, they are the exception.
                        After plenary powers are conferred to maintain a nationality, we find
                        certain limitations imposed upon Congress, but they do not apply to the
                        exercise of any authority delegated, and they are immediately followed with
                        like restrictions upon the States. One supreme authority is created. No
                        State is recognized as a sovereignty in the sense that it would allow it to
                        question the paramount authority of the general government, in the exercise,
                        in its own way under the constitution, of its supreme governmental power.</p>
                    <p>Congress is expressly empowered to levy and collect taxes, to borrow money,
                        to regulate commerce, to coin money and provide for the punishment of
                        counterfeiters, to declare war, to raise and support
                            armies, to provide and maintain a navy, to
                            make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval
                            forces, and finally, to avoid all possible misunderstanding,
                        Congress is authorized "TO MAKE ALL LAWS WHICH SHALL BE NECESSARY and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing
                            powers, and all other powers vested by this constitution in the
                        government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof."</p>
                    <p>Next we have restrictions upon the powers of Congress, but they do not relate
                        to the powers conferred. They relate to immigration, the writ of habeas corpus, ex post facto legislation, taxation,
                        the use of the public monies and titles of nobility. Then follow
                        restrictions upon the States, which divest them of every attribute of
                        sovereignty that is essential to the national government. When the structure
                        of the constitution was reared, which had thus delegated powers to
                        Congress--first specially and then by general and unlimited authority to
                        pass all necessary laws to carry them into effect, so careful were the
                        authors lest the dregs of the confederation might interpose to restrict and
                        cripple it, that the constitution and the laws made in pursuance thereof,
                        are declared "the supreme law of the land, and the judges of every State
                        shall be bound thereby, anything in the constitution or laws of any State to
                        the contrary notwithstanding." Even the express reservation to the States,
                        or the people, of powers not delegated to the government, appears in an
                        amendment, which does not limit any power of the general government, or lead
                        to any other than the natural construction that would have been given had
                        the section not been inserted. But the reservation embraces only powers not
                        delegated, expressly or by implication, while the articles of confederation,
                        reserved all powers not "expressly delegated."</p>
                    <p>The power of Congress "to raise and support armies" has but a single express
                        limitation, and that prevents the appropriation of money to support armies
                        "for a longer term than two years." This is a wise restriction. The
                        appropriation of the public money must originate in the popular branch of
                        Congress, and that is chosen every two years. The people have, therefore,
                        reserved to themselves the right to review the war making power at every
                        Congressional election, and arrest war by electing members who will refuse
                        the necessary appropriations, if the war does not meet their approval. But
                        beyond this limitation, the exclusive power to raise armies is vested in
                        Congress, and there can be no unwarrantable exercise of power in the
                        premises unless some other provision of the constitution is violated.</p>
                    <p>Because for three quarters of a century this government has never had
                        occasion to exercise its extreme powers, it is no reason why we should
                        hesitate to sanction them. The life of the government has never been periled
                        until the late rebellion aimed to dismember the Union by the sword. We have
                        had profound peace ever since the establishment of the government, with the
                        exception of a few years of war with England in 1812 and Mexico in 1846,
                        neither of which so taxed the resources of the nation as to call for the
                        exercise of extraordinary powers. It is not unnatural, therefore, that when
                        the government is compelled in self defence to call into requisition its
                        full powers, many should question its authority. The experience of the past,
                        and to some extent the teachings of the present, led to such conclusions.
                        The men who conceived and inaugurated the rebellion had for years sought to
                        limit the powers of the government, by insisting upon constructions of our
                        organic law which would make it but an instrument of death. Many honestly
                        followed them, and all who sympathized in any degree with their purposes
                        gave a ready assent. A liberal and just construction, being without
                        precedent, because the extremity of the government was without precedent,
                        was readily antagonized by the treacherous, the cowardly, the venal and the
                        weak; but when the law-making power of the nation was called upon to act for
                        the safety of the Republic, it assumed that it had power to raise armies,
                        and legislated so as to exercise its power.</p>
                    <p>The power to raise armies cannot admit of limitation short of some positive
                        restrictions of the constitution itself. How Congress shall raise armies, is
                        left for Congress to decide. It is expressly empowered "to make all laws
                        necessary" to do so. It surely will not be insisted that, when treason was
                        assailing the life of the nation, Congress could provide for raising
                        volunteers or conscripting men, and be powerless to enforce obedience to its
                        call. To raise armies means more than to call for a given number of troops.
                        Quotas on paper will not defend a nation against a desperate foe in the
                        field, armed, disciplined and attacking the government and its people with
                        murderous purpose. The men must not only be called, but they must be had.
                        Congress must not only ask them to come, but it must coerce those who refuse
                        to come, and if it cannot do it in one way, it must do it in another way. If
                        it cannot enforce obedience by courts-martial it must do it in some more
                        summary manner. It is expressly authorized "to make rules for the government
                        and regulation of the land and naval forces," and it is no longer a question
                        that the government may hold a man as in the military service as soon as he
                        is drafted. It was held by Judge Washington in the case of Houston vs Moore,
                        5th Wheaton, that it is competent for Congress to declare men to be in the
                        service as soon as they are drafted, and the act of Congress does so declare
                        them. This learned court has therefore to deal with Henry Reilly in the case
                        before it, as a man in the military service of the government, and subject
                        to the rules and regulations prescribed by Congress for the government of
                        the military forces of the country. The fact that it involves the political
                        franchise of thirty thousand men who have been citizens of Pennsylvania, as
                        is stated by the gentleman who preceded me, (Mr. Sharpe) so far from
                        requiring the court to hesitate to enforce the penalty imposed by Congress,
                        should rather demand of the courts to seek earnestly for powers within the
                        government, to teach faithless citizens the fundamental doctrine so well
                        expressed by Blackstone, that "allegiance is the tie or ligament which binds
                        every subject to be true and faithful to his sovereign, in return for
                        protection which is afforded him." Had there been thrice thirty thousand
                        deserters in Pennsylvania instead of thirty thousand, we should in all
                        probability be without government, liberty or law to-day; and if thirty
                        thousand can with impunity refuse allegiance in the hour of peril to our
                        common institutions, certainly any indefinite number might do the same. Mr.
                        Sharpe did well to render thanks to the God of battles for victory and
                        peace, when pleading for the escape of a skulking deserter, for he could not
                        thank the men whose cause he represents with so much earnestness and ability
                        for the civil and religious blessings we all enjoy.</p>
                    <p>The power of Congress to raise and support armies having been derived from
                        and delegated by the people, let us inquire under what circumstances they
                        gave the power, and also how they exercised the same power themselves. I
                        have already referred to the articles of confederation, and their failure to
                        meet the necessities of the government. Had they been stringent and
                        centralizing in their aim, as might have been reasonably the case
                        considering they were created in the midst of civil war, and the
                        constitution which followed, been a change from the centralizing to the
                        Democratic policy, I might be unable to demonstrate so clearly the plenary
                        powers conferred on Congress. But just the reverse is the truth of history.
                        In war the people of the revolution tested a government of limited powers--I
                        mean limited powers to exercise its authority expressly delegated, and they
                        were more than satisfied with the experiment. They met after peace and
                        independence had been won, and declared it necessary "to form a more perfect
                        union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility," &amp;c., by
                        withdrawing the limitations upon the general government and clothing it with
                        supreme authority in all things pertaining to nationality. They had
                        exercised the power to raise and support armies themselves. They had just
                        passed through seven years of fearful war. They had suffered every exaction
                        its grim visage could frown upon them. They had felt the horrors of
                        conscription--</p>
                    <p>WOODWARD C. J.--We never had any conscription law in this country.</p>
                    <p>MR. M'CLURE--If that be true, then the people conscripted themselves without
                        law. There was no general government empowered to make such a law, but
                        conscription was nevertheless enforced.</p>
                    <p>STRONG J.--We had a government, a confederacy, but it was only advisory.</p>
                    <p>WOODWARD C. J.--There certainly was no draft in the war of 1812.</p>
                    <p>MR. M'CLURE--Certainly there were drafts made both during the revolution and
                        the war of 1812, but they were made by the States. The government never was
                        authorized by Congress to draft until 1863. In 1812 the government called
                        upon the States for their quotas, to be filled by volunteers or by draft as
                        the States might elect.</p>
                    <p>WOODWARD C. J.--Yes, in 1812; but I think no State ever drafted.</p>
                    <p>THOMPSON J.--There was no Federal draft, but there were State drafts in 1812.</p>
                    <p>[MR. CESSNA here handed the court an original copy of a call for volunteers
                        by Gov. Snyder, during the war of 1812, which ordered a draft for such
                        counties as should fail to fill their quotas within a specified time.]</p>
                    <p>MR. M'CLURE--We get the policy of conscription from the people themselves.</p>
                    <p>WOODWARD C. J.--How is that?</p>
                    <p>MR. M'CLURE--The people did not part with the power to raise armies by the
                        articles of confederation, and it was therefore reserved to themselves.
                        Congress was empowered only "to agree upon the number of land forces, and to
                        make requisition upon each State for its quotas." How the requisitions
                        should be filled, was for the people, in the exercise of their reserved
                        powers to determine, and they, in several instances, resorted to
                        conscription. After conscripting themselves in the exercise of the power to
                        raise armies, they delegated the power to Congress under the constitution,
                        without any limitation.</p>
                    <p>WOODWARD C. J.--That is all in a circle. It is not certain that the people
                        delegated the power to conscript.</p>
                    <p>MR. M'CLURE--They did not in express terms, but they raised armies in that
                        way when the power belonged to them--enforced conscription upon
                        themselves--and while conscription and war were still fresh in their
                        recollections, they parted with the entire power to raise armies without
                        reserving any rights.</p>
                    <p>WOODWARD C. J.--Having the power to conscript themselves, and having
                        delegated certain powers to the general government, does it necessarily
                        follow that they delegated the power to conscript? The power in the people
                        is not the point in the controversy.</p>
                    <p>MR. M'CLURE--I regret that the learned Chief Justice does not understand me
                        as I desire to make myself understood. Your Honor will not deny that
                        originally all power was in the people themselves. In framing the articles
                        of confederation, they parted with but a portion of their powers, gave no
                        unlimited powers to Congress even in the exercise of delegated authority,
                        and expressly reserved to themselves all powers not in terms delegated. The
                        confederacy fixed quotas and called upon the States for troops; the power to
                        raise armies being then in the people and not in the general government. The
                        people, therefore, adopted such measures as they deemed proper to raise
                        armies, and one mode they enforced was the draft upon themselves. Thus did
                            they exercise the power to raise armies.
                        Immediately after the war, they parted with the power to raise armies--they
                        delegated it to Congress without prescribing how it should be exercised, or
                        forbidding the use of any means Congress might deem essential to carry it
                        into effect. They had just experienced conscription, and they authorized
                        Congress to exercise the very powers they had enforced by conscription.</p>
                    <p>STRONG J.--I scarcely think that all this is relevant to the question at
                        issue.</p>
                    <p>MR. M'CLURE--I submit that the question has been raised by the court, and I
                        certainly have no desire to pursue it. It seems to me needless to discuss
                        the constitutional power of the government to raise armies by conscription,
                        when this court had already offered the constitutionality of the
                        conscription law of March 3, 1863, in the case of Kneedler vs Lane.</p>
                    <p>WOODWARD C. J.--The constitutionality of the conscription law was never
                        affirmed by this court.</p>
                    <p>MR. M'CLURE--I have before me what purports to be the opinion of this court,
                        in Kneedler vs Lane, 9th Wright, 295, by which final judgement was rendered,
                        and it affirms the constitutionality of the conscription law in the clearest
                        terms.</p>
                    <p>REED J.--This court did certainly assert the constitutionality of the
                        conscription law.</p>
                    <p>WOODWARD C. J.--On the contrary it has decided it unconstitutional in regular
                        form.**</p>
                    <p>STRONG J.--This court has certainly decided that the conscription law is
                        constitutional, Mr. McClure, and you can proceed with your argument.</p>
                    <p>MR. M'CLURE--But let us follow the people a step farther in the exercise of
                        the power to raise armies. They not only called men into the service by
                        conscription, but they proscribed them as aliens
                        for not responding to the call of the country. This they did in many, and
                        perhaps a majority, of the States. Indeed I believe that there was not a
                        single State that did not pass laws of some kind forfeiting either
                        citizenship or property, or both, for refusal to aid the country in war.
                        Even after the war South Carolina and Georgia passed laws forever
                        disfranchising those who had refused to join in the revolution. In a
                        majority of the States these laws were enforced long after the adoption of
                        the constitution. In some States they required trial and conviction
                        precedent to forfeiture of property and citizenship. In other States they
                        disfranchised by laws proscribing them for treason without trial, and in
                        others they allowed trial in some cases and in others refused it. After the
                        adoption of the constitution, Massachusetts passed a law disfranchising for
                        a term of years, and in some instances for life, those who had participated
                        in Shay's rebellion. They did not require trial, but their guilt was a
                        matter of proof when the ballot was offered.</p>
                    <p>Pennsylvania, too, has no doubtful record as to the manner in which the
                        people, in the exercise of the power to raise armies, enforced obedience to
                        their mandates. On the 8th of May, 1778, the Supreme Executive Council--the
                        body of delegates through which the people governed themselves--passed "an
                        act for the attainder of divers traitors," (those who refused military
                        service in the war against the King) requiring certain persons to report themselves for trial on or before the 25th
                        of June next ensuing, "on pain that every of them stand and be attainted of
                        high treason to all intents and purposes, and shall suffer such pains and
                        penalties, and undergo all such forfeitures, as persons attainted of high
                        treason ought to do." In pursuance of this law, the Council made public
                        proclamations, and those who failed to comply with the provisions of the
                        law, forfeited citizenship forever and their property was confiscated.
                        Registers were appointed to keep a record of traitors and their estates, and
                        rewards were paid for discovering forfeited estates. To this day we have
                        preserved, as a monument of the stern patriotism of our forefathers in
                        Pennsylvania, the list of hundreds of men whose names come down to us, as
                        Henry Reilly's appears to-day, branded with the infamy of deserting the
                        cause of a common inheritance.</p>
                    <p>Nor was the lawfulness of this legislation questioned any more than were its
                        wisdom and justice. The general government in its legislation after the
                        adoption of the constitution, scrupulously referenced this proscription of
                        faithless men. In 1790, Congress passed an act to establish a uniform rule
                        of naturalization, and lest it should, in the exercise of its supreme power,
                        relieve the men who had deserted in the revolution, it concludes with the
                        proviso--"that no person heretofore proscribed by
                        any State, shall be admitted a citizen as aforesaid, except by an act of the
                        legislature of the State in which such person was proscribed." This law was
                        passed by the men who had either framed the constitution, or who had
                        witnessed its birth with the profoundest interest, and well understood its
                        meaning, and it was approved by the great hero-statesmen who had presided
                        over the deliberations of the convention--the immortal Washington. It was
                        manifest that an act of Congress relieving them of the pains and penalties
                        enforced by the States would, in their judgement, have been the supreme law
                        of the land, any acts of the States to the contrary notwithstanding, but
                        Congress expressly gave its sanction to the forfeitures and left it to the
                        States, by explicit proviso, to say when they should become citizens of the
                        United States. But in this act Congress had not gone far enough. It only
                        excluded from citizenship those who have been proscribed by the States, while it restored to citizenship those who
                        had been convicted of refusing service to the
                        country and their citizenship and property thereby forfeited. Congress had,
                        therefore, by the supreme law of the land, yet manifestly by inadvertance,
                        restored to their civil rights certain persons who had been convicted by the
                        States before the adoption of the constitution, and made aliens of those who
                        had been proscribed. Accordingly on the 14th of April, 1802, Thomas
                        Jefferson, the father of the Democratic tendencies of our government, signed
                        a bill relating to naturalization and citizenship, concluding with this
                        proviso:--"That no person heretofore proscribed, by any State, or who has been legally convicted of having joined
                        the army of Great Britain during the late war, shall be admitted a citizen
                        as aforesaid, without the consent of the legislature of the State in which
                        such person was proscribed." This act perfected the work of justice as the
                        people had ordained when they had the power, and
                        Congress thus placed the high seal of the supreme law of the land upon the
                        forfeiture of citizenship and property, both by proscription and conviction,
                        and the deserters of the revolution were made aliens, strangers and
                        wanderers in their own land, without franchise, property, or power, and they
                        had to brave the scorn of the people who had won liberty, until they found
                        refuge in the grave.</p>
                    <p>STRONG J.--The constitution acknowledges the existence of States. It is the
                        creation of the people. Is it not essential to the existence of States that
                        the State governments themselves shall have the power to determine who
                        shall, and who shall not vote? And when Congress says who shall not vote, is
                        it not invading the rights of the States?</p>
                    <p>MR. M'CLURE--Yes, sir, I accept both propositions as stated by your Honor. I
                        will, at the proper time, show that the act of Congress disfranchising
                        deserters is not on conflict with the laws of Pennsylvania regulating
                        suffrage. It transgresses upon no State privilege. I do not propose to claim
                        that Congress may regulate suffrage in the States, but regulating suffrage
                        and forfeiting citizenship as a penalty for crime, by the power that creates
                        citizenship, are two very distinct propositions. Pennsylvania confers the
                        right of suffrage only on those who are, by the
                        supreme law, made citizens of the United States. But I will notice this
                        point more fully hereafter.</p>
                    <p>I have shown how the power to raise armies was exercised by the people,
                        especially in our own State, where enforcement of the demand for military
                        service was carried to the forfeiture of citizenship and property by
                        proscription. Even the corruption of blood was effected by proscription in
                        Pennsylvania, and the limitation of appropriations to two years for war
                        purposes, and the denial of the corruption of blood by attainder of treason,
                        are the only express restrictions imposed upon their own policy when they
                        transferred their power to Congress.</p>
                    <p>Having traced this power to raise armies, and the manner of its exercise,
                        from its fountain, I now propose to inquire how it has been construed by the
                        judicial tribunals of the government since it has been delegated to
                        Congress.</p>
                    <p>It is the doctrine of the most eminent expounders of the constitution that
                        "whenever the end is required, the means are authorized; whenever a general
                        power to do a thing is given, every particular power for doing it is
                        included." Story refers to the power of Congress in the following clear and
                        pointed terms:</p>
                    <p>"To establish a National Government, and to affirm that it shall have certain
                        powers, and yet that in the exercise of those powers it shall not be
                        supreme, but controlled by any State in the Union, would be a solecism so
                        mischievous and so indefensible, that the scheme could never be attributed
                        to the framers of the constitution, without manifestly impeaching their
                        wisdom as well as their good faith. The want of such an effective practical
                        supremacy was a vital defect in the Confederation, and furnished the most
                        solid reasons for abolishing it. It would be an idle
                            mockery to give powers to Congress, and yet at the same time declare
                            that those powers might be suspended or annihilated at the will of a
                            single State; that the will of twenty-five States should be surrendered
                            to the will of one. A government of such a nature would be as unworthy
                            of public confidence, as it would be incapable of affording public
                            protection or private happiness."--Story on the Constitution,
                        249.</p>
                    <p>What is proposed here by the defendant in error, but that the power of
                        Congress to raise armies shall be "annihilated at the will of a single
                        State?" This learned court is asked to sanction the mischievous and
                        indefensible solecism, that while Congress has the power to raise armies,
                        yet in the exercise of that power it is controllable by Pennsylvania. And
                        why? Because, forsooth, it disfranchises a deserter; because it takes at his
                        own word one who disowns his citizenship and allegiance.</p>
                    <p>In the case of Strugess vs. Crowinshield, 4th Wheaton, 193, the Supreme Court
                        of the United States held that--</p>
                    <p>"Whenever the terms on which a power is granted by the constitution to
                        Congress, or whenever the nature of the power itself requires that it should
                        be exercised exclusively by Congress, the subject is as
                            completely taken away from the State legislatures as if they had been
                            expressly forbidden to act on it."</p>
                    <p>If the legislature cannot interpose to limit the action of Congress, on any
                        particular subject, surely the courts of the State cannot do so; and it will
                        not be doubted that the power to raise armies is not only given to Congress
                        in terms, but it is a power the nature of which requires that it must be
                        exercised exclusively by Congress. If it cannot be so exercised, it would be
                        no power at all, for every State that chose to cripple the government in
                        time of peril, could find some pretext for doing it, and the nation would be
                        at the mercy of any single State.</p>
                    <p>The same court also held in the case of McCulloch vs State of Maryland, 4th
                        Wheaton, 421, that--</p>
                    <p>If a certain means to carry into effect any of the
                        powers expressly given by the constitution to the government of the Union,
                        be an appropriate measure, not prohibited by the
                            constitution, the degree of its necessity is a question of
                        legislative discretion, not of judicial cognizance."</p>
                    <p>Again, in the same case and same page it is held that--</p>
                    <p>"If the end be legitimate, and within the scope of
                        the constitution, all the means which are
                        appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, and which are not
                        prohibited, may be constitutionally employed to carry it into effect."</p>
                    <p>That the end to be attained by the act of Congress
                        imposing the penalty of disfranchisement upon deserters, is legitimate and
                        within the scope of the constitution, will not be questioned, and unless the
                            means employed are plainly prohibited, they
                        must stand the test of judicial scrutiny. Of their necessity Congress is the sole judge--it is "a question of
                        legislative discretion," says the Supreme Court of the United States, and
                        this learned court must have the clearest evidence that the exercise of this
                        power, in the particular manner in which Congress has seen fit to exercise
                        it, is flagrantly at war with the constitution itself before it can question
                        the validity of the law. Even if it were an issue in which there is
                        concurrent authority in the general and State governments, so far as the
                        action of the two conflict, the State must yield to the paramount authority
                        of the general government. In Houston vs Moore, 5th Wheaton, 49, the Supreme
                        Court of the United States held as follows:--</p>
                    <p>"But in cases of concurrent authority, where the laws of the States and of
                        the Union are in direct and manifest collision on the same subject, those of
                        the Union being the supreme law of the land, are of paramount authority, and
                        the State so far, and so far only as such incompatibility exists, must
                        necessarily yield."</p>
                    <p>In support of the position I have assumed, I need not go beyond the decisions
                        of this learned court. In the case of Moore vs Houston 3d S. and R. 190, the
                        late Chief Justice Gibson said--</p>
                    <p>"If the act upon which this proceeding is founded, is in collision with any
                        act of Congress, it is void. The 6th article and
                        2nd section of the constitution of the United States declares that the
                        constitution and the laws are made pursuant to it, to be the supreme law of
                        the land, binding upon the Judges of the State Courts, notwithstanding
                        anything to the contrary in the Constitution or laws of any State. It
                        follows, that where an act of Congress, and an act of the State Legislature,
                        come in conflict, the latter must give way. A refusal by the State
                        authorities to execute an act of Congress in preference to their own law,
                            would be a step toward the dissolution of the
                        Union."</p>
                    <p>I have referred to these authorities not to establish the power of Congress,
                        but to demonstrate in what manner and to what extent a particular power may
                        be exercised by Congress when it is admitted to be delegated. The power to
                        raise armies is not questioned, nor is it disputed that in the exercise of
                        that power Congress is the sole judge of the necessity of legislation, and
                        can be restrained only because of an infraction of the constitution itself.</p>
                    <p>But it is answered by the able counsel for the defendant in error, that the
                        act of Congress "proposes to inflict and impose pains and penalties upon
                        offenders, before and without trial and conviction by due process of law, and therefore is in direct antagonism to the
                        bill of rights."</p>
                    <p>I am discussing the grave issues involved in this case with a just
                        appreciation of the fact that ours is a government of law, and no supreme
                        necessity can justify its violation. If Henry Reilly is not condemned by the
                        law, he cannot be condemned at all. But he is
                        condemned by the law unless the law forbids, in the clearest terms, that he
                        should be condemned as Congress has condemned him. The restriction must not
                        be by implication. It must be explicit and expressed. Is the penalty imposed
                        by the act of Congress in this case thus confronted by the constitution? If
                        so, we have as yet failed to find it, unless the construction put upon certain clauses of that instrument by the
                        opposing counsel is to be accepted as the constitution itself.</p>
                    <p>If the constitution had provided that no citizen should be deprived of life,
                        liberty or property unless convicted by a jury of his
                            peers, the act of Congress would be at war with the bill of
                        rights, and would necessarily fall before the supreme restriction of the
                        fundamental law. But it does not thus provide, nor does it provide anything
                        approaching it in cases such as the one before this learned court. It does
                        not merely omit to make such provision, but it makes a very different
                        provision--one in language well considered and designed to guard in the
                        clearest terms against just such a construction
                        as that given by the counsel on the other side. The constitution says:</p>
                    <p>"No person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime,
                        unless on a presentment or an indictment of a grand jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in
                            the militia, when in actual service, in time of war or public
                        danger; nor shall any person be subject, for the same offence, to be
                        twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall he be compelled, in any
                        criminal case, to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life,
                        liberty or property without due process of law;
                        nor shall private property be taken for public use without just
                        compensation."</p>
                    <p>This is the only article of the constitution that refers to the punishment of
                        capital or other infamous offences in the land and naval forces, and it
                        refers to such cases only to except them from the
                        process of law expressly provided for those not
                        in the military service. Mark how carefully the distinction is made, and
                        then follow it to the succeeding section where it is provided that "in all
                            criminal prosecutions, the accused shall
                        enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial by an
                            impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall
                        have been committed." Citizens, under ordinary circumstances are entitled to
                        speedy and public trial by an impartial jury. In such cases, such trial only
                        would be "due process of law," but those who are in "the land or naval
                        forces," are, in express terms, excepted from these guaranteed rights."</p>
                    <p>What then, is "due process of law" in the land and naval forces of the
                        nation? The constitution omits to define it, and the omission was clearly
                        intentional on the part of those who framed it. I have heretofore shown that
                        Mr. Reilly was in the land forces of the government. The law expressly so
                        declares, and the right of Congress to do so has been judicially determined.
                        Mr. Reilly is therefore subject to the rules and articles of war, which are
                        but a series of Congressional enactments, or rules and decisions founded
                        thereon. There is no constitutional restriction whatever. For the offense he
                        has committed, as confessed by the record before the court, he might have
                        been pursued, arrested, tried by a drum-head court, condemned and executed.
                        Such a proceeding would have been "due process of law." The right of all
                        governments to inflict the death penalty for violation of military rules and
                        regulations, has never been questioned, and desertion is one of the offences
                        for which life is often forfeited. But when life
                        should be taken, no code of laws, and no provision of the constitution,
                        could properly determine. The power to enforce obedience, maintain safety
                        and achieve success in military operations must be plenary, and at times,
                        when important or perilous movements are being made, or about to be made,
                        life will be taken for an offence which under ordinary circumstances would
                        be punished but moderately or perhaps entirely overlooked. Due process of
                        law, therefore, in regulating armies, is dictated by the necessities of the
                        service, and when power is conceded to take life, it seems to me that power
                        to impose the lesser penalty cannot be disputed.</p>
                    <p>But, it is argued, that penalties are imposed in the military service only
                        after trial--that there must be some sort of
                        trial and conviction. It is not necessarily so. Mr. Reilly could have had a
                        trial at any time, but he elected not to be
                        tried, because he was confessedly guilty. He had no defence, as the record
                        here shows. He could have reported at any time to the nearest Provost
                        Marshal, and demanded trial. He had been offered pardon if he would return,
                        but he rejected it, and after he had thus forfeited the forgiveness of the
                        government to which he owed allegiance and service, he could have returned
                        at any time, suffered such penalty as might have been inflicted, procured
                        his discharge at the close of the war, and now be entitled to all the rights
                        of citizenship. But with the full knowledge of the fact that continued
                        desertion forfeited his citizenship he elected to become an alien and not to
                        be tried by any tribunal.</p>
                    <p>WOODWARD C. J.--I do not understand what you mean by "elected."</p>
                    <p>MR. M'CLURE--He could have reported at any time and demanded trial. Had he
                        been arrested he would have been tried. He therefore elected to become and
                        alien by the rules and regulations governing the army--the act of Congress
                        in question being but a part of the rules and articles of war--rather than
                        report for trial and service.</p>
                    <p>WOODWARD C. J.--This penalty was not provided until after his desertion.</p>
                    <p>MR. M'CLURE--That is true, but he persisted in his desertion every day he
                        remained, and he was no less guilty every day he continued as a deserter,
                        than the day he deserted.</p>
                    <p>[The proclamation of the President was here read to the court by Mr. Cessna,
                        in answer to an inquiry for it by the court.]</p>
                    <p>Some months after he had deserted, he was offered pardon if he would return
                        to service within sixty days. He was ordered to
                        return, by the highest military authority, and he was bound to obey, but he
                            disobeyed, repeated the crime of desertion,
                        and persisted in the crime every day and hour he skulked away from the
                        service.</p>
                    <p>Due process of law in this case is the law of the
                        land. "The words 'due process of law,'" says the Supreme Court of the
                        United States, 18th Howard, 276, "were undoubtedly intended to convey the
                        same meaning as the words 'by the law of the land' in Magna Charta. Lord
                        Coke in his commentary on these words (2 Just. 50) says they mean due
                        process of law." If a forbidden mode of determining guilt was adopted by the
                        act of Congress, then it would not be the law of the land, for it would be
                        at variance with the law; but the constitution disposes of the whole
                        question by authorizing Congress "to make rules for the
                            government and regulation of the land and naval forces." It is
                        empowered to govern them, because it is a supreme necessity, and its rules must be obeyed. If disregarded, it must
                        be able to enforce obedience, and may punish even unto death for
                        disobedience. Upon this sweeping delegation of power--as absolute as it is
                        essential--there is no limitation, expressed or implied. Its law is
                        therefore the law of the land. It is expressly excepted from the narrow
                        channels marked out for civil authority by the bill of rights, and imposes
                        its penalties in its own way and from its judgement there is no appeal.</p>
                    <p>Nor is it so violent an innovation upon the rules which obtain at times in
                        the civil tribunals of the country. It is charged as a monstrous abuse of
                        power to entrust an election officer with the decision of the grave question
                        whether a man is disfranchised or not. There is, indeed, nothing startling
                        in that. Considering that election boards have exercised that power
                        unquestioned from time immemorial, my learned friend who proceeded me, (Mr.
                        Sharpe) need not have been so much shocked at the mere proposition to allow
                        election officers to accept or reject a vote. If he and I should make a
                        wager on an election, and his vote should be challenged, who would determine
                        whether or not he had, by his own act, disfranchised himself? He would not
                        question the right of the board to reject his vote.</p>
                    <p>THOMPSON J.--That law is unconstitutional.</p>
                    <p>READ J.--It is certainly good morals.</p>
                    <p>MR. M'CLURE--It has never been impeached, and it is therefore the law of the
                        State.</p>
                    <p>THOMPSON J.--An unconstitutional act cannot be the law.</p>
                    <p>MR. M'CLURE--No court has ever declared it unconstitutional. Should an
                        election board do so? If they cannot decide the question of citizenship, can
                        they determine the validity of a law? Pray, what can an election board decide?</p>
                    <p>AGNEW J.--Anything which disqualifies is determined by the election board.</p>
                    <p>MR. M'CLURE--Yes, sir.</p>
                    <p>AGNEW J.--Suppose a man goes out of the State and his absence disqualifies
                        him, as a voter, the election board will certainly reject his vote.</p>
                    <p>MR. M'CLURE--Certainly. The election board decides everything pertaining to
                        the right of suffrage. They are responsible only for an abuse of their
                        power, and not for an honest error of judgement in accepting or rejecting a
                        vote any more than is a judge in a court below when reversed by the court of
                        last resort. Indeed, the law clearly contemplated the decision of the most
                        important questions by election boards. One of the board is expressly
                        denominated a judge by the law, and they must of necessity decide not only
                        questions of taxation and residence, but they must pass judgement on the
                        great question of citizenship when it is raised before them. They decide the
                        question of the blood of the proposed elector when it is in doubt; and
                        thereby are empowered to declare a man disfranchised and a stranger to our
                        citizenship, just as the election board of Hamilton township declared Henry
                        Reilly. They decide upon the legality of votes on every ground--for
                        non-payment of taxes, alienage, non-residence, non-age, and may even decide
                        against the solemn oath of the claimant for suffrage on the question of his
                        intentions as to residence, if the fact in their opinion, warrant it. I
                        submit therefore that the disfranchisement of deserters by election boards
                        is no new or startling feature in the history of such tribunals, as they
                        have decided questions of equal moment for a time whereof the memory of man
                        runneth not to the contrary. If the charge of desertion is wrongfully made,
                        he can disprove it as can a legal voter who is charged with any other act
                        that disfranchsises him.</p>
                    <p>WOODWARD C. J.--He must first be convicted of the offence.</p>
                    <p>MR. M'CLURE--When felony disfranchised citizens, conviction was necessary,
                        but conviction is, in such cases, necessary to due process of law. In case a
                        man is disqualified as a voter by non-payment of taxes, or alienage, or
                        non-residence must there be a conviction before the board can reject his
                        vote? As these are not offences against the penal laws, how are persons to
                        be convicted? If these acts of negligence require conviction by the courts
                        before persons can be disfranchised, then we have been acting without
                        warrant of law ever since the formation of the government. The only
                        conviction necessary, is the decision of the election board.</p>
                    <p>If I should now be guilty of contempt of this learned court, what would be
                        conviction?--what due process of law? Says the late Chief Justice Black in
                        the case of Passmore Williamson, 2nd Casey, 19--"Contempt of court is a
                        specific criminal offence. It is punished sometimes by indictment, and
                        sometimes in a summary proceeding, as it was in this case. In either mode of
                        trial, the adjudication against the offender is a
                            conviction, and the commitment in consequence is execution." This
                        power is a supreme necessity to maintain the dignity, and prevent the
                        obstruction, of the administration of Justice, and such conviction is due
                        process of law. It is the law of the civilized world--the law of the land.</p>
                    <p>The constitution provided in the most cautious terms, that persons held to
                        service or labor in one State, under the laws thereof, escaping into
                        another, shall be delivered up on claim of the
                        party to whom such service or labor may be due. Congress was thereby charged
                        with making all necessary laws to carry the provision into effect. It
                        involved the liberty of those upon whom claim was made, but Congress denied
                        the right of trial by jury. An irresponsible commissioner was entrusted with
                        the execution of the law, and a premium paid for deciding against the
                        liberty of the person from whom service was claimed, but it was held by the
                        highest judicial tribunal of the nation to be due process of law. Thus were
                        the powers of Congress construed to blacken and degrade our nationality. Are
                        they to be abridged now because they were exercised to preserve and redeem
                        that nationality?</p>
                    <p>If Henry Reilly had been sued for debt in the civil courts when he was
                        wandering in a strange land to escape military service, a copy of the writ
                        left at his house, where his family remained under the protection of the
                        government he refused to defend, would have been sufficient to obtain
                        judgement against him by default, and he could thus have been deprived of
                        his property without hearing or even knowledge. It would have been due
                        process of law. And so it is when the defendant in the civil courts elect
                        not to appear and demand trial, as was the case with Henry Reilly in the
                        proceedings which led to the suit now before this court. Judgement is taken
                        for want of an appearance, or for want of an affidavit of defence, and it is
                        not questioned that it is due process of law. In all our judicial
                        proceedings either party may have judgement against him by neglect or
                        default. He may elect not to avail himself of the advantages of trial, and
                        judgement in such cases is confessedly the law of the land. Even in criminal
                        cases prisoners may waive trial, because guilt is too clear to be
                        controverted, and liberty is yielded to the majesty of the law by the
                        election of the person charged with the crime.</p>
                    <p>If Henry Reilly had reported, had been mustered in the service, and been
                        absent on any day at morning and evening roll-call, he would have been marked a deserter by his commanding officer, and
                        until he disproved that record, he could not have drawn any pay, no matter
                        how long the government may have been in arrears with him. It would have
                        been due process of law. Had the government seen fit to order a Captain and
                        two Lieutenants on court martial duty to try Mr. Reilly, they could have
                        condemned and executed him, and it would have been due process of law. All
                        these summary convictions are sanctioned in the military service, and as Mr.
                        Reilly was confessedly in the military service for all the purposes to be
                        considered by this court, can it be doubted that the government, in
                        obedience to the necessities of the service, could empower a Captain acting
                        as Provost Marshal, to mark a defaulting soldier as a deserter, and enforce
                        the record and its penalties against him until he chooses to avail himself
                        of trial and vindicate himself?</p>
                    <p>The authority to raise armies is part of the same grant that charges Congress
                        with the levy and collection of taxes, and I ask the attention of this court
                        to the manner in which Congress exercises the power to raise revenue.
                        Revenue is of course, a supreme necessity, but let us look for a moment what
                        is regarded as due process of law in the collection of taxes. In the case of
                        Murray's Lessee et al vs. Hoboken Land and Improvement Company, 18th Howard,
                        272, we have an instructive lesson on the law of the land in the mere matter
                        of collecting money due the government. In that case an audited account from
                        the Treasury department against a collector, was treated as a judgement, in
                        accordance with the act of Congress, and property was levied upon and sold
                        by the U. S. Marshal to satisfy the claim. Naturally enough it was alleged
                        that there was not due process of law. The mere balancing of an account by a
                        subordinate in the Treasury department, without notice or hearing, and by
                        such warrant proceeding to collect it, would seem to be a summary way of
                        reaching execution not demanded by the exigencies of civil administration in
                        the time of peace. But Congress is empowered to collect revenue, and in the
                        exercise of its power, it decided not to enter into litigation with its
                        subjects. It construed due process of law to be the seizing of a defaulter's
                        property on a settled account, notwithstanding the provision of the
                        constitution that forbids the taking of life, liberty or property without
                        proper trial. The act of Congress even went so far as to provide that under
                        certain circumstances the account between the government and the creditor
                        might be the subject matter of a suit; but it was reserved to the government
                        to allow or deny judicial investigation as it might deem best.</p>
                    <p>In the decision of the case Justice Curtis says, page 280, that "the
                        proceedings authorized by the act of 1850 cannot be denied to be due process
                        of law, when applied to the ascertainment and recovery of balances due to
                        the government from a collector of customs, unless there exists in the
                        constitution some other provision which restrains Congress from authorizing
                        such proceedings." There being no such express prohibition, the power of
                        Congress was declared to be properly exercised, although it denied any and
                        every form of trial beyond the settlement of an account by a clerk.</p>
                    <p>Referring to the powers of Congress, the learned Judge proceeds, page 281:</p>
                    <p>"Among the legislative powers of Congress are the powers to lay and collect
                        taxes, duties, imposts, and excises; to pay the debts and provide for the
                        common defence, and the welfare of the United States; to raise and support
                        armies; to provide and maintain a navy, and to make all laws which may be
                        necessary and proper for carrying into execution those powers. What officers
                        should be appointed to collect the revenue thus authorized to be raised, and
                        to disburse it in payment of the debts of the United States; what duties
                        should be required of them; when and how and to whom they should account,
                        and what security they should furnish, and to what
                            remedies they should be subjected to enforce the proper discharge of
                            their duties, Congress was to determine."</p>
                    <p>The court then goes back to the broad principle, that the power to lay and
                        collect taxes must carry with it all needful power to enforce its laws in
                        its own way. On this point the court say:</p>
                    <p>"The power to collect and disburse revenue, and to make all laws which shall
                        be necessary and proper for carrying that power into effect, includes all known and appropriate means of effectually
                        collecting and disbursing that revenue, unless some such means should be
                        forbidden in some other part of the constitution. The power has not been
                        exhausted by the receipt of the money by the collector. Its purpose is to
                        raise money and use it in the payment of the debts of the government. * * *
                        It may be added that probably there are few governments which do or can
                        permit their claims for public taxes, either on the
                            citizen or the officer employed for their collection or
                        disbursement, to become subjects of the judicial controversy, according to
                        the course of the law of the land. IMPERATIVE NECESSITY has forced a distinction between such claims and all others,
                        which has sometimes been carried out by summary methods of proceeding, and
                        sometimes by systems of fines and penalties, but always in some way observed
                        and yielded to."</p>
                    <p>If "imperative necessity" is a warrant for Congress resorting to summary
                        process for the collection of its revenues, how much greater is the
                        necessity for the summary punishment of those who, in the hour of the
                        nation's peril, refuse to render it service. The government could survive judicial controversies between itself
                        and its people relative to taxes, but public policy forbids it. The
                        government could not survive judicial or even
                        military controversies with its people in time of war, and to decide
                        otherwise would be the work of death. Shall public policy reserve its most
                        stringent mandate for the civil power of the government in time of peace? If
                        so, then is our whole fabric of government a mockery. It can oppress in the
                        name of "imperative necessity" where the course of the law of the land would
                        attain the end desired, but is left paralyzed and powerless to summon its
                        strength to preserve its own existence. Surely this learned court will not
                        so decide in the face of the teachings of the highest judicial tribunals of
                        the nation as to the authority and duty of Congress to make all needful laws
                        to enforce obedience in time of common danger. Bear in mind that our highest
                        court has held that "all the powers vested in Congress by the constitution
                        are complete in themselves, and may be exercised
                        to their utmost extent, and that there are no
                        limitations upon them other than such as are prescribed in the constitution."--9th Wheaton, 196. The limitations
                        must be PRESCRIBED. They must not be gathered from the mere spirit of any
                        other part of the organic law. They must be clear and positive to limit a
                        positive power delegated. Have we any such limitation? Is there any that
                        approaches such a limitation? If there were such, of whatever character,
                        they would completely destroy the power to raise armies, instead of making
                        that power complete in Congress. It would be a confession that the
                        constitution is but a mass of foolish, fatal contradictions, and that our
                        boasted nationality is but a fiction and a fraud. Happily, however, our
                        organic law is not thus marred--it has no fearful element of death within
                        itself.</p>
                    <p>I had intended to refer in detail to the opinions of the members of this
                        court in the case of Kneedler vs. Lane, but I have already trespassed too
                        long upon your patience. Those opinions will necessarily enter largely into
                        the consideration and judgement of this case. In them will be found the true
                        land-marks of the constitution as defined by this court, and the power of
                        Congress to exercise the necessary authority to
                        enforce obedience to its laws, is clearly stated by the opinions in support
                        of the judgement of the court. If the act of 1865 should now be declared
                        invalid by this court, it would place its own judgements in strange
                        antagonism. It would present the singular spectacle of the judicial tribunal
                        of last resort in Pennsylvania first deciding that Congress had the power to
                        conscript men for the army, but had not the power
                        to enforce service or to punish desertion, without first submitting its
                        measures to the capricious judgement of thirty-six States, with different
                        laws, differently constituted courts, and judges of different affinities and
                        sympathies. I confidently trust that our government and our judicial records
                        will never witness such an attempt to deform and cripple the supreme law of
                        the land.</p>
                    <p>I shall now briefly examine the objection raised against the act of Congress
                        on the ground that it impairs the right of suffrage in the States.</p>
                    <p>The forfeiture of citizenship by Henry Reilly was voluntary, and the crime of
                        desertion was committed with the full knowledge of the fearful penalty that
                        must follow it. He thereby deliberately elected to forfeit his great
                        birth-right, inherited from his enlightened and beneficent government. It
                        had conferred that right upon him, and for the
                        crowning crime of disclaiming the allegiance demanded in return, the
                        priceless blessing of citizenship is revoked by the same power that created
                        it. It was done because, as Wheaton says, "the United States is a supreme
                        government, acting not only upon the sovereign members of the Union, but directly upon the citizens." That it is supreme
                        over the sovereign members, is established by the uniform teachings of our
                        history. But for this supremacy the revolt in Pennsylvania would have been
                        the end of the Union, but the rebellion was suppressed by the supreme
                        authority, as similar revolts were suppressed in South Carolina and Rhode
                        Island. Vattle s. p. c. says:</p>
                    <p>"Since a nation is obliged to preserve itself, it
                        has a right to everything necessary for its preservation. * * * A nation has
                        a right to everything that can ward off imminent danger, and keep at a
                        distance whatever is capable of causing its ruin; and from that very same
                        reason that establishes its right, it has also the right to the things necessary to its preservation."</p>
                    <p>Wheaton, 115, says:</p>
                    <p>"This right of self-preservation necessarily involves all
                            other incidental rights as a means to give effect to the principal
                        end."</p>
                    <p>That the general government is charged with the preservation of our
                        nationality, and that its power over the sovereign members of the Union for
                        the purpose, cannot be questioned. If it is thus supreme over the sovereign
                        members of the Union, can it be less so upon the individual citizens who
                        hold their great franchise by the laws of the United States? The States
                        cannot abridge the rights of a citizen of the Union, because he holds his
                        citizenship from the supreme power, and can the States interpose to defeat
                        the government in the exercise of its power to enforce the reciprocal duties
                        of the citizen? The States cannot grant or enlarge or diminish the rights of
                        citizenship, and it will be pretended that they can prevent the great
                        creative power from forfeiting its gifts as a penalty for offences against
                        its authority? Kent says that the question of citizenship "is one of national and not of individual (State)
                        sovereignty." Every citizen of the United States "is a component member of
                        the nation," says Attorney General Bates, "with rights and duties under the
                        constitution and laws of the United States which cannot be abridged by the
                        laws of any State." In the same opinion (29th Nov. 1862) he says that "every
                        person who is a citizen of the U. States, whether by birth or
                        naturalization, holds his great franchise by the laws of the United States,
                        and above the control of any particular State."</p>
                    <p>The government had made Henry Reilly a citizen of the United States, and
                        thereby assumed certain obligations touching his welfare which it was bound
                        to fulfil. Had the government failed in the performance of its obligation,
                        he could withdraw himself from it. Vattel s. p. 106, says:</p>
                    <p>"If the body of society or he who represents it (the government) absolutely
                        fail to discharge their obligations toward the citizen, the latter may withdraw himself, for if one of the contracting
                        parties does not observe his engagements, the other is
                            no longer bound to fulfil his, as the contract is reciprocal
                        between society and its members. It is on the same principle that society
                        may expel a member who violates its laws."</p>
                    <p>Blackstone says:</p>
                    <p>"Allegiance is the tie or ligament which binds every subject to be true and
                        faithful to his sovereign, in return for protection which is afforded him."</p>
                    <p>Attorney General Bates also clearly defines the relations between the citizen
                        and the government, in his opinion of the 29th of Nov. 1862. He says:</p>
                    <p>"The duty of allegiance and the right to protection are correlative
                        obligations, the one the price of the other, and they constitute the bond
                        between the individual and his country."</p>
                    <p>Such are the mutual obligations between the government and the citizen, and
                        they are created without any reference to the States, and must be fulfilled
                        without the interposition of any of the sovereign members of the Union. They
                        are above and beyond the powers of the States, and how is the State to
                        interpose to defeat a penalty going to the forfeiture of citizenship? It can
                        neither make or unmake a citizen, and it has no voice in defining the powers
                        of the government, or the penalties it may impose for the violation of the
                        compact made with the citizen.</p>
                    <p>STRONG J.--Is there any power in Congress to declare who are not citizens,
                        except so far as naturalization is concerned?</p>
                    <p>MR. M'CLURE--Yes, sir.</p>
                    <p>STRONG J.--Congress has authorized a uniform law for naturalization. Does it
                        follow that they have the right to make or unmake citizens?</p>
                    <p>MR. M'CLURE--Citizenship is not a natural right, according to the practical
                        teachings of our government. It must be derived from some competent power.
                        It certainly is not from the State. It must be from the supreme power of the
                        nation. If not from the government, whence is citizenship derived? It is a
                        created, a vested right, and there must be a power to create and vest it,
                        and that power certainly can take it away in any manner not in conflict with
                        its faith with the citizen. Surely it can forfeit it as a penalty for crime.</p>
                    <p>AGNEW J.--You mean that Congress may say whether he is a freeman or not by
                        the crime he may have committed, and that being no freeman he has no ballot?</p>
                    <p>MR. M'CLURE--Congress, the legislature power of the government that has the
                            only control of the question of citizenship,
                        has, in the exercise of its power to raise armies, imposed the penalty of
                        alienage for the crime of desertion, and I cannot doubt that he thereby
                        ceases to be a freeman in the accepted sense of the term. He is deprived of
                        the rights of citizenship, and the State then
                            disfranchises him by its own laws.</p>
                    <p>STRONG J.--Is there not a distinction between the right of a citizen and the power of
                        citizenship? A man may be put in prison for some crime. He does not thereby
                        lose his citizenship, but is merely suspended in the exercise of it.</p>
                    <p>AGNEW J.--Is a man in prison convicted of felony a freeman?</p>
                    <p>STRONG J.--Yes, sir.</p>
                    <p>MR. M'CLURE--Suppose that Congress had imposed the penalty of imprisonment
                        for life for desertion, instead of forfeiture of citizenship, would there be
                        any distinction practically between the right of
                        a citizen and the power of citizenship? If by the
                        law of the land Henry Reilly had thus been punished, could any power but the
                        power that imposed the penalty relieve him?--and could the State enterpose
                        and say that it impairs the right of suffrage in Pennsylvania? If so, every
                        criminal consigned to the penitentiary for counterfeiting, robbing mails or
                        piracy could plead the sovereign power of the State to prevent the
                        disfranchisement of its citizens by imprisonment. And what renders the
                        position of the counsel on the other side the more inconsistent on this
                        point, is the fact that Congress may, by its article of war, impose the
                        death penalty for desertion, but it cannot disfranchise without an
                        infraction of the rights of the States. Could inconsistency go farther? The
                        greatest punishment may be lawfully inflicted, but the State can arrest the
                        lesser punishment because some imaginary power or franchise, inherent in the
                        State, is violated.</p>
                    <p>The United States as a supreme nationality possesses the power essential to
                        that nationality to define the obligations of citizenship, and to demand the
                        paramount allegiance due from the citizen to the government. Its power
                        acting "directly upon the citizen," as Wheaton
                        defines it, is certainly competent to declare what gross, palpable acts of
                        abjuration and abandonment of the obligations of citizenship, shall work a
                        forfeiture of such right, and the organic law of Pennsylvania is in harmony
                        with this power of the general government. In conferring suffrage, as the
                        State has the undoubted right to do, it provides in sec. 1, art. 3, of the
                        constitution as follows:</p>
                    <p>"In elections by the citizens every white freeman
                        of the age of twenty-one years, having resided in the State one year, and in
                        the election district where he offers to vote at least ten days immediately
                        preceding such election, and within two years paid a State or county tax,
                        which shall have been assessed at least ten days before the election, shall
                        enjoy the rights of an elector; that a citizen of the
                            United States, who had previously been a qualified voter of the
                        State and removed therefrom and returned, and who shall have resided in the
                        district and paid taxes as aforesaid, shall be entitled to vote after
                        residing in the State six months: Provided, That
                        white freemen, citizens of the United States,
                        between the ages of twenty-one and twenty-two years, and having resided in
                        the State one year, and in the election district ten days as aforesaid,
                        shall be entitled to vote although they have not paid taxes."</p>
                    <p>With this provision of our State constitution the whole ground of citizenship
                        and suffrage is covered. Observe how it refers to "citizens" and "citizens
                        of the United States" three times in the single section, thus scrupulously
                        defining the first qualification of the voter to be national citizenship. No claim or pretence is put forth of any
                        other citizenship than that derived from the general government, and to it
                        the State properly defers in granting the right of suffrage. Is there any
                        other citizenship? Is there any attribute of citizenship derived from the
                        State? Suffrage is not an essential attribute of citizenship, for
                        citizenship can be enjoyed while suffrage is denied, as has been the case in
                        many States. If Pennsylvania had limited suffrage, founded upon property or
                        educational qualification, and thus disfranchise certain citizens of the
                        United States, could the act of Congress be enforced against those who are
                        denied suffrage, and not against those who are
                        voters? In the one case it could not be pretended that it impaired the right
                        of suffrage in the State. This objection followed to its logical result,
                        would present the State as claiming to discriminate between its own people
                        in tolerating and nullifying the penalties imposed by Congress for an
                        offence against the national authority.</p>
                    <p>But it is a mistake that the act of Congress assumes to regulate the question of suffrage in the State of
                        Pennsylvania. It is true that it imposes a penalty which, by our own law, disfranchises the offender, but
                        Congress no more assumes thereby to limit the suffrage of the State than it
                        does by the punishment of any other crime which incidentally works
                        disfranchisement. It takes life for certain offences, and the lesser rights
                        are destroyed with the greater, including citizenship and suffrage. It
                        incarcerates persons in penitentiaries for years, and convicts are thus
                        disfranchised--not because Congress assumes to regulate suffrage, but
                        because the loss of suffrage is a necessary result of the punishment
                        imposed. It drafted our people into the army, and thereby disfranchised
                        them, because it denied them access to the lawful places of voting; but no
                        one pretended that he could escape service because the government impaired
                        the right of suffrage. Disfranchisement in all these cases is an incident
                        resulting from the exercise of necessary and conceded powers on the part of
                        the government, and so it is in the case now before the
                            court.</p>
                    <p>Henry Reilly is disfranchised by the laws of Pennsylvania and not directly by
                        the laws of Congress. Congress does not declare that he shall not vote, and
                        in some of the States he doubtless could vote, but the organic law of
                        Pennsylvania confronts him and denies him suffrage because he has forfeited
                        his national citizenship, and we limit suffrage in this State to those who
                        are citizens of the United States. His disfranchisement is one of the
                        incidental results of his alienage, and so made by our law, and not by the law of the
                        nation.</p>
                    <p>It is clear therefore that Congress may compel citizens to accept service or
                        forfeit citizenship without assuming to control the question of suffrage in
                        the States, for in point of fact it does not regulate it thereby. In some of
                        the States aliens can vote, and I see no reason why one who owes no
                        allegiance to any other government may not vote in those States,
                        notwithstanding the loss of national citizenship. The fact that Pennsylvania
                        carries the sacrifice of national citizenship to the sacrifice of suffrage,
                        is not an assumption on the part of Congress to control the suffrage of the
                        State. On the contrary, the organic law of the State relating to suffrage,
                        is in entire harmony with the power exercised by Congress by the act of
                        March 3, 1865.</p>
                    <p>It is too late to question the right of expatriation in the State or nation,
                        nor is it peculiar to the government of the United States. It was one of the
                        boasted features of the liberty of the Romans that they could elect at any
                        time to maintain or renounce allegiance to the government, and it is laid
                        down by Chancellor Kent that the right to choose as to allegiance exists in
                        every citizen. Public policy, and the comity to be observed between nations,
                        forbid that we should deny to our own citizens what we invite the citizens
                        of other nations to do. We recognize the doctrine of expatriation by the
                        naturalization of foreigners, their admission into full fellowship, and
                        their eligibility to nearly every office within the gift of the people, and
                        can we assume to deny the same rights to our own citizens? A subject of a
                        foreign power who had merely declared his intention to become a citizen of
                        the United States--who had elected to change his allegiance--commanded the
                        guns of our navy in defense of his rights, and the civilized world yielded
                        assent to the action of our government in the case. Our own State adopted
                        this policy at an early day. Chief Justice Tilghman declared in the case of
                        Jackson vs. Burns, 3 Binney, 85, that "the principle of the English law,
                        that no man could, even for the most pressing reason, divest himself of the
                        allegiance under which he was born, is not compatible with the constitution
                        of Pennsylvania." I regard it, therefore, as a principle settled beyond
                        dispute, in this country, that any citizen may elect to change his
                        allegiance, and thereby to forfeit his great franchise of national
                        citizenship, at his pleasure. He may elect to change his allegiance, and thereby voluntarily forfeit his
                        citizenship, or he may elect to forfeit his citizenship by refusing his allegiance to his own government.
                        Either is equally a withdrawal of his allegiance, equally a forfeiture of
                        his citizenship, and equally the act of his own deliberate choice. It is
                        true that there is a distinction between the voluntary change of allegiance,
                        and the sacrifice of citizenship as a penalty for refusing allegiance. In
                        the one case the forfeiture is a penalty, and in the other it is a matter of
                        preference; but it does not effect the principle. It shows that the right of
                        citizenship can be divested alike by the subject and the government,
                        although the government does not relieve the citizen from the obligation of
                        citizenship, when it is forfeited as a penalty and no new allegiance chosen.</p>
                    <p>And while the citizen has the right to change his allegiance and surrender
                        his national citizenship, the government has also certain rights essential
                        to the enforcement of its contracts while they continue to exist. If, as is
                        said by Vattel, 106, the citizen fails to "observe his engagement with the
                        government, then the government is not bound to fulfil it, as the contract
                        is reciprocal between society and its members," and, he adds that it is "on
                        this principle also that society (the government) may expel a member who violates the laws." It is on this point that
                        the highest power incident to nationality is properly exercised. A nation
                        has not only the power, but it insists manifest duty, to exclude from
                        citizenship those whose character wholly unfits them for the exercise of
                        such rights. It is on this ground, I presume, that the Indians have been
                        excluded from national citizenship, and free persons of color have been
                        denied citizenship, without regard to fitness. Attorney General Bates held
                        that a man cannot be a citizen if his character "is so incompatible with
                        citizenship that the two cannot exist together." France forfeits citizenship
                        for accepting a foreign office. The subject elects to surrender it, and the sacrifice is complete. So does
                        Prussia. Austria forfeits the citizenship of those who abandon the country,
                        whether in peace or war. While England denies the right of expatriation,
                        nevertheless the English subject sacrifices all his rights as a citizen by adhering to a foreign power. Throughout
                        all civilized history, the same doctrine has been the accepted law of
                        nations, and the right to declare citizenship
                        forfeited has been uniformly practised.</p>
                    <p>If this power can not be exercised by the government, then we are bound to
                        espouse their cause and protect every traitor in foreign lands. Henry Reilly
                        might flee to Canada as a cowardly or faithless citizen, to escape the
                        service he owes the government that protects himself and family, and if
                        called upon for service there, or any of the rights of American citizenship
                        should be violated in him, the government would be bound
                            to follow the skulking deserter to protect and defend him. Can it
                        for a moment be supposed that a great nationality is thus at the mercy of
                        every perfidious or craven creature who has attained the great franchise of
                        citizenship, only to disgrace it and deny its reciprocal duties? If so, in
                        time of public danger by war, the whole military power of the government
                        might be necessary to protect our deserters in their rights of citizenship,
                        as they enjoy themselves in foreign lands to escape the defence of their own
                        institutions. The ministers plenipotentiary of the late rebel government
                        could have commanded the military and naval power of the United States to
                        avenge their wrongs, as they bore the offering of treason from court to
                        court abroad, appealing for recognition and aid to overthrow the Republic. I
                        think that even the able counsel on the other side (Mr. Sharpe) would be
                        appalled at the fruition of his own doctrine, when the traitor and deserter
                        should call for the protection of the government they had disowned in the
                        day of trial.</p>
                    <p>There can be no middle ground in the application of the doctrine. While
                        persons are citizens they are entitled to the fullest protection throughout
                        the world. The talismanic words, "I am a Roman citizen," once commanded the
                        respect of the proudest potentates of earth, but not less entitled to
                        respect is the claim of American citizenship. Wherever civilization has
                        found a resting place, there is our flag, the emblem of our liberties, and
                        the rights of our citizens are as sacred in the dominions of the most
                        absolute despotism as in our own free Pennsylvania. But while the government
                        throws its broad shield of protection over its citizens in every clime, it
                        exacts reciprocal duties, and they must be performed. If not performed, the
                        compact is destroyed--the government lives on to fulfill its beneficent
                        mission to a faithful people committed to its supreme civil guardianship;
                        but the citizenship dies and leaves an alien, a wanderer and a stranger to
                        mankind, where once was an integral part of a mighty nation. It is not done
                        by trial, for process cannot reach the fleeing civil suicide, and legal
                        impossibilities cannot be exacted from the national authority any more than
                        it can exact them from its citizens. But it is done by the supreme
                        sovereignty, that has the exclusive right to create, define, limit and
                        control the question of citizenship, and it follows its treacherous and
                        cowardly sons who have disowned its protection to escape its service, with
                        the terrible fiat, that they "shall be deemed and taken
                            to have voluntarily relinquished and forfeited their rights of
                            citizenship, and their rights to become citizens."</p>
                    <p>It is "the supreme law of the land" that thus thunders its retributive
                        vengeance against the faithless, and the response from the organic law of
                        Pennsylvania is that disfranchisement shall follow the forfeiture of
                        citizenship. Such is the fate of Henry Reilly, deliberately accepted and
                        invited upon himself, and it is as JUST as it is LAWFUL!</p>
                    <p>*The case of Huber vs. Reilly, involving the constitutionality of the act of
                        Congress disfranchising deserters, was carried to the Supreme Court by writ
                        of error from the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin county. Mr. Reilly, a
                        citizen of Hamilton township, had been enrolled, drafted and not fled; and
                        he failed to report to put in a substitute or to pay commutation, and when
                        he presented his ballot in the fall of 1865 his vote was rejected by Mr.
                        Huber, who was judge of the election. Mr. Reilly brought an action against
                        Mr. Huber for damages for refusing his vote, and on a case stated, the Court
                        below had entered judgement in favor of Reilly for one dollar and costs. The
                        counsel of Huber--Messrs. John Cessna, Stumbaugh &amp; Gehr and M'Clure
                        &amp; Stewart--took a writ of error to the Supreme Court, where it was
                        argued on the 24th of May last. Mr. Cessna opened the argument in support of
                        the act of Congress, and Mr. Sharpe followed in an argument directed to
                        establish the unconstitutionality of the law. He assailed the
                        constitutionality of the law on the following grounds:</p>
                    <p>"1st. It is incompetent for Congress, under the Federal Constitution, to
                        impair either directly or indirectly, the right of suffrage in the States.</p>
                    <p>"2nd. The Act of Congress of the 3d March, 1865, is an ex
                            post facto law, and therefore violates the Federal Constitution.</p>
                    <p>"3d. The act proposes to inflict and impose pains and penalties upon
                        offenders before and without trial and conviction by due
                            process of law, and therefore is in direct antagonism to the bill
                        of rights."</p>
                    <p>Mr. M'Clure concluded the argument in support of the constitutionality of the
                        law, and we give his remarks as reported phonographically by Luther Stroup,
                        Esq.</p>
                    <p>**It is but fair to the Chief Justice, as the argument makes no explanation
                        of the disagreement of the judges here given, to state that in the case of
                        Kneedler vs. Lane, the court decided in Pittsburg, on the 9th of November,
                        1863, on granting a preliminary injunction to
                        restrain the Provost Marshal from forcing Kneedler into the military
                        service, that the conscription act was unconstitutional. On the 16th of
                        January, 1864, the case came up for final hearing and judgement, and the
                        court on the same case, pronounced the law constitutional. Chief Justice
                        Lowrie, who had delivered the opinion of the court on the 7th of November,
                        1863, had in the mean time been succeeded by Justice Agnew, and the
                        conviction of the court was thus changed by the change of the members
                        composing it. Chief Justice Woodward doubtless held therefore that the
                        doctrine of stare decises made the first decision
                        of the law of the State, which new judges could not, or certainly should not
                        reverse. It should not be overlooked, however, that the decision of 9th
                        November, 1863, was on granting a preliminary injunction on an ex parte hearing, as is common upon bills in equity
                        praying for immediate relief. Chief Justice Lowrie, in delivering the
                        opinion of the court, expressed his regret that the government had not been
                        represented, and said:--"I cannot be sure that I have not overlooked some
                        grounds of argument that are of decisive importance. But
                            the decision now to be made is only preliminary to the final
                        hearing, and it is hoped that the views of the law officers of the
                        government will not then be withheld." (9th Wright, 240.) The decision,
                        therefore, that Chief Justice Woodward declared to be the only decision of the court "in regular form," was
                        declared by the opinion of the court to be but a "decision" that was
                        "preliminary to the final hearing." On the final hearing, and final
                        judgement, the court affirmed the constitutionality of the conscription law,
                        vacated the orders previously made in the case, and the motions for
                        injunction were overruled.</p>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Just ninety years ago this day, the fathers of the Republic adopted the
                        Declaration of Independence, severing the Colonies from the despotic rule of
                        Britain. They did it because, as they said:--"We hold these truths to be
                        self-evident, that all men are created equal;
                        that they are endowed by their Creator, with certain inalienable rights;
                        that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness;" and they
                        further declared that "to secure these rights, governments are instituted
                        among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed."</p>
                    <p>The author of this immortal document was born and reared under the dominion
                        of Slavery, but he abhorred it, and ceased not until his death to demand its
                        extinction. He meant just what he said when he wrote the noble sentence we
                        have quoted, and with prophetic pen he delineated the inevitable evils which
                        must result from the perpetuity and growth of bondage. He saw in it not only
                        discord and internecine strife, but he looked even to the day when the
                        majesty of justice might reverse the positions of the races, and make the
                        oppressed the ruling power of the land degraded by Slavery.</p>
                    <p>In time the founders of the Republic passed away, and their teachings were
                        forgotten. Step by step the insatiate wrong spread over our fair land, until
                        it possessed the major portion of our territory. It lavished our treasure to
                        extend its power. It crimsoned our history with blood to gain new fields
                        wherein to glut its appetite. It compassed every department of the
                        government, and at last dragging even the judiciary down to its fatal
                        embrace. The blooming territories of the West were opened to its desolating
                        tread, and even the States were no longer safe from its relentless
                        aggressions. The nation was taught that four millions of human beings in our
                        midst had no rights the white man was bound to respect; and the free
                        industry of twenty millions, the life, the wealth, the power and the glory
                        of our nationality, was crushed and dishonored to rivet the fetters of the
                        bondmen.</p>
                    <p>At last, in the fullness of His time, the great national crime had reached
                        the measure of its oppression, and expiation was demanded. Slavery was ready
                        to rear its bloody altar to dismember the government that had fostered and
                        protected it. In madness it sought destruction, and a million lives and
                        countless treasure made up its last atonement. As God is just, it was
                        vanquished in the conflict; and after ninety years of mingled right and
                        wrong--of boundless progress and debasement--of humiliating compromise and
                        its legitimate fruits in fraternal war, the great Republic has returned to
                        celebrate its natal day on the platform founded by Thomas Jefferson in 1776.</p>
                    <p>"The Day we celebrate" will pass the lips of thousands of loyal men to-day as
                        the leading toast, where patriotism is gathered in clusters of faithful
                        people to rejoice over a nationality preserved by most appalling sacrifices;
                        and there will be rejoicing from the Atlantic to the far western Pacific
                        slopes, and from the cool waters of the Northern lakes to the burning sands
                        of the Gulf shore, that a nation of thirty millions has written in its
                        richest blood this lesson for mankind--"That all men are created equal." The
                        sullen traitor, who still hopes to destroy by treachery what he failed to
                        dismember by the sword; his cowardly sympathizer who consistently wars with
                        progress, justice and loyalty, and the ignorant who ask the protection of
                        law against the advancement of a degraded race, will all be sad to-day,
                        because Justice and Freedom are indelibly emblazoned upon the escutcheon of
                        the Republic. But where there is a patriotic heart, there will be gladness
                        that the great fabric of free government has reached the last decade of a
                        century; and with grandsire, sire and son sleeping amidst three generations
                        in its ridges, plains and valleys, it gives promise to many generations yet
                        unborn, that here shall be the impregnable citadel of Freedom--"life,
                        liberty and the pursuit of happiness" for the children of every condition
                        and clime. Thus answers 1866 to the birth day of the Republic just ninety
                        years ago!</p>
