<b>Gen. Geary in California</b><br> (Column 7)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>An account of Gen. Geary's years in California, where he served as a "sort
                    of sub-Postmaster General for the Pacific colonies" following his return to the
                    U. S. in the wake of the war with Mexico. While in the "El Dorado State," the
                    piece relates, Geary played a integral role in the transformation of San
                    Francisco from the frontier , a task made difficult by the fact that the city's
                    only "system of law was Spanish and colonial, and whose population, gathered as
                    by a whirlwind from all the ends of the earth, comprised as much of the very

                    <p>New Cumberland, PA., April 4, 1866.</p>
                    <p>GENTLEMEN:--Your communication, bearing date March 20th, only reached me on
                        the 30th ult., and in compliance with your request, I proceed to answer it
                        with as little delay as possible:</p>
                    <p>You propound to me three questions, to which you request an answer, viz:--</p>
                    <p>"1. Will you, if elected chief magistrate of Pennsylvania, faithfully exert
                        the power of your administration, so as to defeat any and every attempt,
                        made by legislation, or otherwise, for the monopoly and control by any one
                        corporation of the railroad policy of the State?"</p>
                    <p>"2. Will you oppose and withhold your sanction from any legislation
                        conferring upon the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, or any company it may
                        control, the authority to build branches, unless the said grant should be
                        under provisions of general law regulating the construction of railroads?"</p>
                    <p>"3. Will you favor, and use the influence of your administration to secure
                        the enactment of a general law authorizing the construction and regulation
                        of railroads within this Commonwealth?"</p>
                    <p>My views and opinions upon these measures I am free to give you, and quite
                        willing to indicate what my official action would be, so far as it is at all
                        proper to do so.</p>
                    <p>Pennsylvania possesses immense treasures of mineral wealth, and most
                        extensive manufactories. To develop these, to foster everything which tends
                        to their development, and to cherish and to promote equally the rights and
                        interests of all her citizens, I firmly believe to be the highest duty of
                        her statesmen. I regard every kind of public improvement as conducive to
                        this end; and I am, therefore, in favor of the most complete and elaborate
                        system of Internal Works, together with a proper system of Protection to
                        Home Industry, as a means of converting our vast mineral resources,
                        agricultural products and manufactured articles into values. Whatever shall
                        so improve our commercial intercourse, enable our manufactures to send the
                        proceeds of their industry to market, and so place our State at the head of
                        the manufacturing and producing States of the Union, shall have my cordial
                        assistance and cheerful approbation.</p>
                    <p>I regard our railroad system as the best mode of commercial and social
                        intercommunication. In addition to the great main lines, the State is
                        enveloped in a network of minor railroads, which pour an increasing stream
                        of coal, iron, ore, lumber, live stock, agricultural products, and the
                        handiwork of skilled labor, to the distributing points within, and beyond,
                        our borders.</p>
                    <p>While these corporations continue to act their part as public servants, they
                        should be carefully protected. They should not be permitted to overstep
                        their legitimate functions. As creature of the law, they should obey, and
                        be, in every respect, subservient to the law.</p>
                    <p>I answer the first interrogatory, that while I believe it to be improper to
                        bring the influence of the Executive Department to bear upon the
                        Legislature, in anticipation of its action, except in the way of
                        recommendation; I am heartily opposed to the creation of any monopoly in the
                        railroad system of the State, or giving any artificial body created by the
                        law, powers which would place it above and beyond the reach of the
                        Legislature.</p>
                    <p>To the second interrogatory, I say, that while a general railroad system
                        would best comport with a sound public policy, it must originate with the
                        legislature, and until it shall be established by law, grants of power may
                        be properly made to railroads to construct branches when they are desired by
                        the people who are immediately interested in the matter, and would promote
                        the development of their property, and afford them avenues to market. Such
                        grants being so restricted as not to violate individual rights or public
                        interest.</p>
                    <p>In reply to your third question, which to my mind includes both the others, I
                        say, again, that I believe a general law regulating the construction of
                        railroads and grants of power for that purpose to be most consistent with
                        public policy and the interests of the Commonwealth; and entertaining these
                        views, I would certainly use the legitimate and constitutional power of the
                        Executive to secure so desirable a result.</p>
                    <p>The spirit of monopoly in this and other matters, should be discouraged in a
                        Republican Government, and I have no sympathy with any policy which may be
                        designed for its encouragement.</p>
                    <p>I am, gentlemen, with high respect, you obedient servant,<br> JNO. W. Geary,</p>
                    <p>To Messrs. Lyon, Shorb &amp; Co., Spang, Chalfant &amp; Co., and
                        others.</p>

<b>A Just Tribute</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Never before, we believe, in the history of our political struggles, has a
                        State administration been accorded the high tribute paid to Gov. Curtin by
                        the popular branch of the legislature on the day of adjournment. Mr.
                        Ruddiman, of Philadelphia, offered the following resolutions, which were
                        adopted without a dissenting voice:</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That in the name of the Commonwealth we
                        tender to Governor Curtin our thanks for the fidelity with which, during
                        four years of war, by which our country was ravaged, and its free
                        institutions threatened, he stood by the National Government, and cast into
                        the scale of loyalty and the Union the honor, the wealth and the strength of
                        the State.</p>
                    <p>Resolved, First by his devotion to his country
                        from the dark hour in which he pledged to the late lamented President of the
                        United States the faith and steadfast support of our people, he has gained
                        for his name an historical place and character, and while rendering himself
                        deserving of the nation's gratitude, has added lustre to the fame and glory
                        to the name of the Commonwealth over which he has presided for two terms of
                        office with so much ability, and in which he has tempered dignity with
                        kindness, and won the high respect and confidence of the people.</p>
                    <p>Such a tribute coming from a House one-third of whose members are not in
                        sympathy with the Executive, and at a time when the great political parties
                        are preparing to marshal their forces for a desperate conflict, tells no
                        formal story of unmeaning compliment; but it declares to the people of the
                        State that in the terrible trials through which we have just passed, there
                        was one man in Pennsylvania who has been so clear in his great office that
                        political prejudice and hostility bow before the lustre of his achievements,
                        and record their willing testimony to his enlightened patriotism and
                        fidelity.</p>
                    <p>Many men have been complimented by an election to the Chief Magistracy of
                        this State. Some have retired with honor and others with varied degrees of
                        administrative success; but it has been reserved for Gov. Curtin alone to
                        win the place in two desperate political conflicts, and to fill the measure
                        of administrative fame as a generous, wise and beneficent ruler, as
                        testified by the mingled voices of political friend and foe. It must be a
                        grateful reflection to him, who has been of all others the most vindictively
                        traduced, that as the bloody throes of civil strife have died away, with one
                        accord the people of his State turn to him as the one who, most of all, has
                        merited their confidence and affection, and as he is drawing to the close of
                        his exhausting official duties, the voice of calumny and the natural
                        dictates of party discipline, pale before the spontaneous approval of a just
                        people for a just and faithful Executive.</p>

<b>Public Laws</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>At one of the legislature's "most laborious sessions" in several years, a
                    number of public laws were passed whose impact will affect every community in

                    legislation authorizing each township to pay $300 to veteran volunteers who
                    re-enlisted in the service without receiving local bounties. In addition, the
                    legislature mandated that "keepers of Restaurants, Eating and Ale Houses" must
                    be licensed by the Quarter Sessions and applications must be filed with the

                        promptness with which they have discharged the delicate and responsible

                    <p>THE "CONSERVATIVE" PARTY.--We desire to call particular attention to the fact
                        that every returned rebel soldier, every draft dodger, every ex-Camp
                        Chasette and every rebel sympathizer is identified with the so-called
                        Conservative party. We further wish loyal men to remember that aside from
                        such as we have mentioned above, there are but few that belong to the
                        organization.</p>
                    <p>They also remember that it is such men as we have described that are now
                        denouncing the acts of our loyal Legislature as unconstitutional. Men who
                        used every exertion in their power to overthrow the Constitution and laws.
                        All the bushwhackers and raiders that during the war waylaid and murdered
                        their fellow-citizens and stole their property, are now identified with this
                        party.</p>
                    <p>We ask loyal men if they can affiliate and cooperate with such men?
                        Notwithstanding some of the measures of the Union party may be
                        objectionable, for all things human are attended with some degree of
                        imperfection, yet can they possibly be as objectionable as the infernal
                        schemes concocted by the rebels and their sympathizing friends? We ask Union
                        men to ponder these matters seriously. They now have to cast their lot with
                        the men who stood side by side with them in sustaining the Government during
                        the war, or with the rebels. The alternative is presented to them, and we
                        are happy to believe from the indications we have seen, that the honorable
                        discharged soldiers and Union citizens almost to a man will co-operate with
                        the Union party, and will aid and sustain our loyal Legislature in carrying
                        out its measures.</p>
                    <p>They fought the rebellion during the war, and they cannot sympathize with
                        those who murdered their sons and other relatives, and who destroyed their
                        property and did all in their power to destroy the Constitution and
                        overthrow the Government.--Clarksville (W. Va.)

                        passed the Legislature during the last session. We now propose to give the
                        substance of all the bills of this character, whether previously noted or
                        not, so they may have them in the space of a single article: GETTYSBURG AND

                    <p>In adjusting and settling the account of the Bank of Chambersburg, at the
                        office of the Auditor General, the Bank had overpaid sixty-four dollars and
                        twenty cents on her tax on capital stock, and two hundred and eighteen
                        dollars and thirty cents on her tax on dividends, which the State Treasurer

                        tavern except that they may be granted at any term of the Court.</p>
                    <p>RELATIVE TO HUCKSTERS.</p>

                    and William Mort. --False Pretense. William Mort not arrested--French, the other
                    defendant, who was a man of over sixty years of age, was arraigned and pleaded
                    not guilty. Verdict, not guilty but that the defendant pay the costs of
                    prosecution. Benjamin Culbertson, the prosecutor, was defrauded by Mort out of a

                    banking house of Kerr, Dunlap, &amp; Co., in Carlisle, which Mort
                    represented as a check--French was with Mort at the time and joined in
                    representing the check as good. The defence was that he was an ignorant man,
                    unable to write his name and unacquainted with business, and that he was imposed
                    on by Mort, who gained the old man's confidence by representing himself as a
                    soldier who had served with French's division in the army. Com. vs. Samuel
                    Roland, Joseph Roland, Sr., and Joseph Roland, Jr. Assault and Battery.
                    Defendants pleaded not guilty. Verdict, that defendants, Samuel Roland and
                    Joseph Roland, Sr., are guilty and that defendant Joseph Roland, Jr., is not
                    guilty. Sentenced to pay a fine of one dollar and costs of prosecution. Com. vs.
                    Charles Miller--Assault and Battery. A true bill. Defendant pleaded not guilty.
                    Verdict, guilty. Sentenced to pay a fine of $10 and the costs. The defendant,
