<b>Corrupt Appointments</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>"One of the most important duties of the present Congress," assert the

                    ensure that only truly deserving candidates are confirmed. To do otherwise, they

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>One of the most important duties of the present Congress, will be the
                        solution of the power of the Executive to prostitute his patronage to
                        debauch the people and control popular elections. It involves a great
                        principle, and must be treated as such. It it now presented to the Senate in
                        the consideration of Executive nominations, and to both branches as a
                        question directly effecting the dignity and purity of the government, and it
                        must be met as an issue that is to fix the policy of future administrations.
                        Had Johnson's perfidy and corrupt abuse of power been practiced in any other
                        nation by the chief ruler, it would have cost such ruler his throne; and the
                        great Republic of the world, whose safety and glory depend upon the
                        uncorrupted power of the people, cannot permit this occasion to pass without
                        making it impossible for future Executives to attempt his own and his
                        country's humiliation and disgrace.</p>
                    <p>Andrew Johnson has ostracized nearly every faithful man since the adjournment
                        of the last session. He not only kicked out--to use his own vulgar
                        parlance--the men who were true to the principles which triumphed by his
                        election; but he exhausted his official power to debauch and subsidize loyal
                        men to share his treachery. Thus while the honest and patriotic spurned his
                        policy and his bribes, only the weak and venal could accept his favors. The
                        result is that the most important offices are now filled by miserable camp
                        followers, often without capacity, most of them without either personal or
                        political integrity, all of them so many monuments of shame in the
                        estimation of the loyal people, and despised even by those who used them in
                        vain to give fresh hopes to treason.</p>
                    <p>The appointment of such men to office has naturally resulted in a system of
                        wholesale political profligacy and debauchery, going down to the meanest
                        creatures who have purchased the crumbs of the high contracting parties. In
                        this district, with two characterless chief revenue officers, the little
                        streams are of course as corrupt as the fountains. The chiefs being the
                        offspring of purchase, the subordinates could not be other than the spawns
                        of corruption. Their places were hawked about from door to door before the
                        election to purchase votes, and since the election, regardless of promises
                        made by the leaders, the same places have been auctioned to the highest
                        bidders. While perhaps few districts have sounded the same depths of
                        political debauchery attained by our new officials and those who created
                        them, we doubt not that in every district of the State, and generally
                        throughout the Union, the same policy has prevailed and the same venality,
                        in a greater or lesser degree, has humiliated the people.</p>
                    <p>For this fearful condition of things there must be a thorough remedy. It must
                        be not merely a temporary expedient, but it must surely guard against the
                        repetition of this disgraceful exercise of power. It will not do merely to
                        reject the unworthy incumbents, and have the President at liberty to
                        re-appoint them after the 4th of March. Nor will it do to attempt a
                        discrimination by the Senate, as to worthy and unworthy appointments, among
                        those who were appointed to supplant incumbents who surrendered their
                        positions rather than betray their principles. Among such men, while there
                        may be different degrees of prostitution, there can be none worthy of the
                        confirmation of the Senate. Where appointments were made to fill vacancies
                        occasioned by death or resignation, they should be confirmed without regard
                        to their political views if they are honest and competent; but no man should
                        be confirmed who bartered his convictions for place, or who supplanted a
                        faithful incumbent under the usual conditions imposed by Andrew Johnson. To
                        confirm any such men would be to make the Senate, and through it the
                        Republican party, give its highest sanction to the perfidy and shameless
                        debauchery of the President.</p>
                    <p>We regard it as the first duty of the Senate to reject all nominations made
                        in obedience to the treacherous and proscriptive policy adopted by the
                        Executive, and when that is once done, the President should be restrained by
                        a law limiting his arrogant exercise of the patronage. No man once rejected
                        by the Senate should be permitted to discharge the duties of any office, or
                        to receive any compensation, after the date of rejection; and on this point
                        Congress cannot be too imperative to insure the safety of the government or
                        meet the demands of the People. This once effected, the policy of Congress
                        relating to future appointments is a grave question, and one that will, we
                        doubt not, be well considered and solved as wise and enlightened
                        statesmanship may dictate. Whatever may be done, no man who came to a
                        faithless President with his price upon his head, should ever be confirmed
                        for any place. If Andrew Johnson will have men who vote the Democratic
                        ticket to fill his offices, let him take men who vote it with some
                        consistency, and let them have his spoils, if true men are to be ostracized.
                        While the appointment of Democrats to office would be a humiliation to the
                        loyal people, and unmixed treachery on the part of the President, yet they
                        will not bear upon their faces the public confession that they have sold
                        their manhood for plunder. Whatever policy may be adopted, let no open
                        corruptionist have place or power in the future of the government.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Stumbaugh recently published in the Philadelphia Press the following card:</p>
                    <p>
                        To the Editor of the Press:
                    </p>
                    <p>SIR: On reading the card of A. K. McClure, Esq., in the Press of the 20th
                        inst., I find the following paragraph:</p>
                    <p>The assumption that the people did not participate in the movement, and that
                        it was the result of my individual effort, is entirely without foundation in
                        fact. It was made in pursuance of a positive pledge from the Republican
                        candidate for Assembly to abide by such instructions, asking only that the
                        question should not be raised in our close district before the election.</p>
                    <p>Now, while I feel satisfied that the communication which you copy from the
                        Harrisburg Telegraph fully answers Mr. McClure's
                        position on the fairness of the Senatorial instructions, the parties
                        participating, and at whose instance the convention was called and the
                        instructions given, I cannot permit Mr. McClure to publish to the world that
                        the movement was made in pursuance of a "positive
                        pledge" from me to abide by such instructions, without replying, emphatically, that there is not one word of truth in
                            the averment.</p>
                    <p>The convention that nominated me asked and received no pledge of any kind
                        from me, although Mr. McClure had put into the hands of one of the delegates
                        certain resolutions, among which was one instructing for Curtin. This
                        delegate found they would have been voted down five to one, and therefore
                        did not offer McClure's resolutions.</p>
                    <p>I was nominated and elected without any pledge,
                        and then Mr. McClure got up his call for a convention, waited upon him and
                        solicited the Republicans to sign his call, and induced very many of them to
                        sign it by his representing to them that I desired to be instructed or to
                        know the sentiment of my Republican constituents on the Senatorial question,
                        when, in fact, neither he nor any other person had ever spoken to me on the
                        subject.</p>
                    <p>I feel assured that Mr. McClure cannot successfully refute the foregoing
                        statement.<br> F. S. Stumbaugh.</p>
                    <p>In order that the public can judge how Mr. Stumbaugh alike regards the truth
                        and his positive pledges, we give place to the following card from three
                        Antrim Republicans, whose truthfulness no one will question who knows them.
                        There are others to whom the same pledges were made, but it is needless to
                        multiply testimony on a subject on which there can be no issue where the
                        public are familiar with the parties.</p>
                    <p>
                        To the Editors of the Franklin Repository:
                    </p>
                    <p>Regarding the "card" of Col. F. S. Stumbaugh, published in the Philadelphia
                            Press of the 23d inst., as impugning the
                        veracity of myself and several of my neighbors, (who had represented the
                        Colonel as having committed himself to obey any proper instructions that
                        might be given by his party after his election, in regard to its choice for
                        U. S. Senator,) I therefore beg leave, in our vindication, to make public
                        through the columns of your paper the following statements:</p>
                    <p>Some time after Col. F. S. Stumbaugh's nomination for the Legislature by the
                        County Convention, and several weeks previous to his election, in a
                        conversation I had with him, (at one of the public meetings held in our
                        Borough,) in regard to the election of U. S. Senator, I understood him
                        substantially to say, that as the candidate of the Union Republican party,
                            he should consider himself in honor bound,
                        (if elected to a seat in the Legislature,) properly and
                            fairly to represent the party, and that he would obey any proper and
                            authoritative expression of its preference in regard to its choice of U.
                            S. Senator, to be chose during the coming session.</p>
                    <p>And in this connection, John Ruthrauff, of our township, who was a member of
                        the Convention that placed Col. F. S. Stumbaugh in nomination as a candidate
                        for the Legislature, states that the Colonel told him, on the morning of the
                        Convention, that he was only opposed to any action of the Convention, in
                        regard to an expression for U. S. Senator, simply on the ground that such
                        action would be prejudicial to his election and would in all probability
                        defeat him; but that after the election, in case he was chosen, he would be perfectly satisfied that the party should
                            instruct him in any way it might deem proper in reference to its choice
                            for U. S. Senator, and that HE WOULD YIELD A CHEERFUL OBEDIENCE
                        TO ITS INSTRUCTIONS.</p>
                    <p>Benjamin Snively, also of Antrim, says that he met Col. F. S. Stumbaugh in
                        Chambersburg, on the day of his nomination for the Legislature by the County
                        Convention, and that Col. Stumbaugh voluntarily entered into a conversation
                        with him, on the subject of instructions and an expression of preference, on
                        the part of the Convention, in regard to U. S. Senator, in which he said
                        that he was opposed to any action then on that subject by the Convention,
                        but only for the reason that it would have a bad effect in his election and
                        would probably cause his defeat; but that should he be nominated and
                        elected, without instructions, he would then be willing
                            that the party should in some proper manner give him instructions as to
                            its choice of U. S. Senator, AND THAT HE WOULD CHEERFULLY OBEY
                        THEM.</p>
                    <p>The position thus assumed by Col. Stumbaugh was eminently just and proper in
                        itself, for who in this enlightened age is bold enough to deny the inherent
                        and sacred right of the People, in all that relates to their interest, their
                        welfare and honor, to instruct their public servants? Nor is it, I think,
                        too much to declare that it was through the faith--I should perhaps rather
                        say hope--thereby inspired, that his election was secured. And why, I ask,
                        should Col. Stumbaugh now not stand by and maintain it? No one, I am sure,
                        deplores more than I do, the unfortunate cause that made the recent
                        Senatorial County Convention, in my judgement, a necessity, or more deeply
                        regrets the unkind card above referred to, which has reluctantly forced his
                        intrusion upon the public notice.<br> GEORGE W. ZIEGLER.<br> GREENCASTLE,
                        Nov. 30, 1866.</p>
                    <p>We, the undersigned, indorse the correctness of the above
                            statements as far as they relate to us, and authorize their

                        To the Editors of the Franklin Repository:
                    </p>
                    <p>Permit us to call the attention of the citizens of Cumberland and Franklin
                        counties to the propriety of calling a general convention, at such places as
                        may be deemed most convenient, with the view of adopting measures to
                        petition the Legislature of the State, which will convene shortly, to make
                        some provision for the payment of claims that many of our citizens hold for
                        forage furnished our troops, and damages sustained in various ways by them
                        in passing to and fro from the seat of war. There are claims held by many of
                        our citizens who aided our troops by furnishing them with forage,
                        &amp;c., that are kept out of their just dues, for some reason or other,
                        and unless some action is taken by the people, it cannot be expected that
                        these claims will ever receive the attention they are justly and equitably
                        entitled to. Let the people speak and they will be heard.<br> MANY.</p>
