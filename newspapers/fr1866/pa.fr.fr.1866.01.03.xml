                    county residents during a meeting held in the Court House on Dec. 22, 1865. The
                    document calls upon the legislature to indemnify those individuals who suffered
                    property loss during the three Confederate raids that occurred in the county
                    during the war.</summary>

                <commentary>"Hon. Thaddeus Stevens delivered a speech recently in the House of
                    Representatives on Reconstruction, which, like all his productions, is pungeant
                    and powerful. It was carefully prepared and read from manuscript, and may
                    therefore be accepted as giving the settled conviction and policy Mr. Stevens
                    will adhere to in the coming struggle on the re-admission of the rebel States.
                    However men may differ as to the policy of enforcing universal suffrage, and the
                    propriety of keeping the rebellious States in the territorial condition for
                    "some years," there are none who can successfully answer his argument as to the
                    legal status of those States. On this point he says:"</commentary>

                <summary>Extracts from Thad Stevens's speech delineating his position on the proper
                    course of action for re-admitting the rebellious states. Basing his opinions on
                    recent judgements rendered by the courts, Stevens contends that the former
                    Confederate states constituted an "independent and belligerent" nation during
                    the war and, for that reason, Congress has sole discretion in determining what
                    criteria they will have to meet before being re-admitted to the Union. In
                    particular, Stevens insists that white southerners will have to re-evaluate
                    their stand on the place of blacks within society before any plan is considered.</summary>

                <head>Relief for Chambersburg</head>
                <origin/>
                <commentary/>
                <excerpt/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>We give in our columns to day the Memorial of the citizens of Chambersburg
                        for legislative relief, and we bespeak for it the candid consideration of
                        the legislature. It is essentially different in its proposition from the
                        indemnity measures rejected by two successive legislatures, and is an appeal
                        to the generosity of a mighty Commonwealth, overflowing with wealth, not to
                        make restitution, but to relieve measurably the crushing desolation which
                        befell our people on the 30th of July 1864. Even when this shall have been
                        done by the legislature, the losses of the sufferers of Chambersburg will be
                        infinitely greater than the losses of any equal number of sufferers by
                        invasion in any of the border counties.</p>
                    <p>This appeal goes to the legislature as the offspring of necessity. If it is
                        denied it will consign hundreds of people, who have struggled thus far, to
                        hopeless ruin. Of the several hundred families rendered homeless by the
                        vandalism of M'Causland, not one-third can restore their buildings or resume
                        their business, and all upon whom this concentrated hate of treason fell are
                        more or less seriously crippled in their operations. In a thrifty town of
                        over five thousand inhabitants, the whole business portion was entirely
                        destroyed, and none were left with means to redeem the ruins. By the
                        generosity of the State in appropriating to the indigent, and the liberal
                        contributions of citizens at home and abroad, absolute want has been averted
                        measurably from the sufferers; but still bankruptcy remains, and the only
                        hope of a general resumption of business and the re-building of the town, is
                        in generous aid from the State.</p>
                    <p>The people of Chambersburg do not ask that their losses shall be paid, nor
                        that even half of them shall be restored. They have paid their taxes; have
                        contributed their full quotas promptly on every call to fill up our armies;
                        have shared all the exactions and bereavements of war with their
                        fellow-citizens in other sections of the State; and in addition have
                        suffered raids and invasion with their inevitable desolation, every year
                        from the commencement of the war to its close, for which there has not been
                        restitution in any degree. Exclusive of the crowning vandalism of
                        M'Causland, the border people suffered four-fold more than any other portion
                        of Pennsylvania; and after all that had been borne, when Franklin county had
                        nearly enough soldiers in the service to have resisted the forces of
                        M'Causland, and was left entirely defenseless, the enemy sought to strike
                        terror in the North by the sacking and burning of Chambersburg. It was not
                        aimed at Chambersburg alone. It was a blow directed against every loyal man
                        in the North; but the desolation, the overwhelming sorrow, fell upon a few
                        hundred citizens, who had to bear the stroke of rebel vengeance on behalf of
                        a loyal people.</p>
                    <p>It seems probable that in time the national authorities will make
                        restitution, at least to citizens of loyal States, for extraordinary losses
                        incurred in the war; but it cannot be done in season to be of essential
                        service to our hopeless sufferers. Unless they can be aided now, they must
                        abandon all hope of retrieving their business. They must yield to strangers
                        who can command the means to restore their houses, and start anew in the
                        world, many with large families, without any means whatever to aid them, and
                        most of them staggered with debt. While war raged and threatened other
                        sections of the State with the same misfortune that was visited upon them,
                        they appreciated the caution that prevented the legislature from giving aid
                        to the despoiled; but now that peace has been won by the heroic sons of
                        Chambersburg, side by side with the brave defenders of the flag from every
                        county of the State; when common sacrifices have been shared in treasure and
                        blood to rescue a common country, and victory has crowned the effort, there
                        would be fitness in a recognition of the claims of Chambersburg--the only
                        town in the North that was destroyed--upon the generosity of the State. To
                        aid Chambersburg to the extent of one-third the losses sustained by the
                        people would enable them to recover from the fearful desolation that was
                        visited upon them, and it would not impose a farthing of taxes upon the
                        people of the State, nor would it be even felt in our plethoric treasury.</p>
                    <p>We have now restored the Nation by the valor of all sections. Our finances
                        never were so prosperous; our people in all portions of the State are
                        requited in their industry and successful in their business operations; and
                        we appeal to the representatives of a happy people not to be unmindful of
                        the crushing spoliation suffered by a few people in Chambersburg, who, after
                        having cheerfully yielded all and even more than most of their
                        fellow-citizens in other counties to preserve the government, were selected
                        by the leaders of treason for its direst vengeance--for its wildest
                        desolation. They ask not restitution--they ask only that the State shall aid
                        them so that they may partially recover from the terrible blow, and receive
                        back its generous appropriation, principal and interest, should the national
                        government ever be just. To the humanity and sense of justice of the
                        legislature the Memorial of the people of Chambersburg appeals, and we
                        cannot doubt that generous aid to our citizens will be heartily sanctioned
                        by the people of the State.</p>

                <summary>The editors issue their support for a memorial recently drafted by Franklin
                    county's residents. Though the previous two legislatures rejected appeals to
                    indemnify those who suffered losses at the hands of the Confederate raiders, the
                    new proposals are different because they do not seek restitution, the authors of
                    the piece contend. In an era when the Commonwealth is "overflowing with wealth,"
                    they maintain that the state can easily afford to ease the "crushing desolation"
                    of the "several hundred families rendered homeless by the vandalism of
                    McCausland." Should the legislature fail to act, these same families will be
                    consigned to "hopeless ruin."</summary>

                <head>The Vote of the 77th Regiment</head>
                <origin/>
                <commentary/>
                <excerpt/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>Some weeks ago we received information that the 77th Pennsylvania regiment,
                        stationed in Texas, had voted on the proper day, and given sufficient Union
                        majority to elect Mr. McConaughy and Col. Rowe. We had the information, in
                        advance of the receipt of the returns, from an officer of the Battery, that
                        an election was held, and that the vote was more than two to one Union.
                        Subsequently a return was filed in Harrisburg by Capt. Beers, the
                        Commissioner sent to Texas to deliver the proper papers and receive the
                        returns, purporting to give Mr. McConaughy 31 majority and Col. Rowe 17
                        majority--electing both gentlemen. We did not doubt that the return was
                        genuine and honest, and so accepted it without inquiry.</p>
                    <p>We have never seen the returns made to Harrisburg and to the Prothonotary,
                        but we have information relative to them that leaves no doubt as to their
                        character. They are manifestly manufactured and fraudulent, and we feel
                        assured that neither Mr. McConaughy nor Col. Rowe will claim their places on
                        this vote. It is established that many of the names returned on the
                        poll-list as having voted, were not there at all. Some were at their homes
                        in this county at the time they are put down as having voted in Texas.
                        Others were never residents of the county, several are dead, and the
                        officers of election whose names are given as certifying to the election
                        returns, were not present nor in the State on the day of election. In
                        addition to these conclusive facts, the returns bear upon their face the
                        strongest evidence that they are not honest. Not a vote is returned for any
                        of the local candidates but the two who were defeated by the home
                        vote--Messrs. McConaughy and Rowe, and the tickets, purporting to have been
                        voted in different portions of Texas, are all written and in the same
                        hand-writing. These facts, taken in connection with the other evidences in
                        the case, leave no doubt that the returns as made up were an after-thought,
                        and were proposed by some man or set of men to effect [illeg] the home vote
                        for two candidates.</p>
                    <p>We belive that the candidates effected by the fraudulent returns had no part
                        in their creation, as both of them openly disown them. But who did commit
                        the fraud? It is known that Capt. Beers was home at least two weeks from
                        Texas before he made this return, and then he made a false return. How did
                        he get it and whence did come? The fact that he made the return is not
                        conclusive evidence that he is the author of it, or that he had any hand in
                        the fraud. He may have received it by mail, or it may have been delivered to
                        him by returning officers of the 77th regiment; but it is due to the public
                        and to himself that he explain exactly when, where, and under what
                        circumstances the returns came into his hands. This will doubtless be
                        demanded of him, and he cannot be silent under the inquiry. It is clear that
                        some party or parties have attempted to force a fraud upon the Union party
                        of this county and Senatorial district and make it responsible for the
                        wrong; but the Union party will not stain its fair fame by even an attempt
                        to sanction or conceal the villainy.</p>
                    <p>Messrs M'Conaughy and Rowe will contest for their respective places; but they
                        will, we feel assured, show clean hands touching this wrong. If they did
                        not, they would be scorned by the entire party that supported them, as it
                        seeks no triumph at the cost of integrity. It supported those gentlemen
                        because they are eminent alike for honesty and ability, and whoever may have
                        perpetrated this wrong, it will not be laid to their charge. But it must
                        have some paternity. It manifestly was <emph rend="italic">not</emph> done
                        to make Mr. M'Conaughy Senator and Col. Rowe District Attorney, for no man
                        of ordinary intelligence would have conceived and executed so stupid a
                        fraud. Upon its face it bears strong evidence that the return was fabricated
                        by some party adverse to the success of Union candidates. It looks as if it
                        had been carefully designed to bring odium upon Messrs. M'Conaughy and Rowe
                        in their contests before the Court and Senate, and this view is strengthened
                        by the positive evidence of several members of the 77th Regiment, now at
                        home, that an election was held and full tickets,--including the entire
                        county ticket--voted in some companies--including the Battery. Was the true
                        return destroyed or suppressed? It looks so from the fact that the
                        Commissioner has given no return, or delivered none when he came back. We
                        trust that there will be a searching, thorough investigation of this
                        transaction, let the blame fall where it may. We belive that it will prove
                        to have been a deliberate plan to suppress honest returns and throw the
                        semblance of fraud upon the Union party and its candidates. There is
                        manifestly fraud somewhere--let it be fearlessly exposed.</p>

                    franchise, a measure Stenger claims is unconstitutional.</summary>
