                <transcript>
                    <p>The detailed report of the Committee on Reconstruction has been made in each
                        House of Congress. They set forth the reasons for the conclusions to which
                        they come, reporting an amendment to the Constitution of the United States,
                        and the two bills with which the public are already familiar.</p>
                    <p>Speaking of the condition of the Confederate States at the close of the
                        rebellion, the committee say:<lb/> These States were in utter exhaustion and
                        without government. The President had no power except to execute the laws of
                        the land as Chief Magistrate. The laws gave him no authority over the
                        subject of reconstruction. By the Constitution he was commander in chief of
                        the army and navy. It was his duty, under the laws of nations and the army
                        regulations, to restore order, to preserve property and to protect the
                        people against violence from any quarter, until provision shall be made for
                        their government.</p>
                    <p>He might, as President, assemble Congress and submit the whole matter to the
                        law-making power, or he might continue military supervision and control,
                        until Congress should assemble on its regularly appointed day. As to the
                        Governors appointed by the President, it could not be contended that they
                        possessed or could exercise any but military authority: They had no power to
                        organize civil governments, nor to exercise any authority except that which
                        inhered in their own persons, under their commissions; neither had the
                        President, as commander-in-chief, any other than military power; but he was
                        in exclusive possession of the military authority.</p>
                    <p>It was for them to decide how far he could exercise it, how far he would
                        relax it; when and on what terms he would withdraw it. He might, perhaps,
                        permit the people to assemble and to initiate local governments and to
                        execute such local laws as they might choose to form, not inconsistent with
                        nor in opposition to the laws of the United States, and if satisfactory,
                        they might safely be left to themselves. He might withdraw the military
                        force altogether, and leave the people of any, or all of those States, to
                        govern themselves without his interference.</p>
                    <p>The committee, after speaking of the origin and leading incidents of the war,
                        say it was waged as a civil war of gigantic magnitude. It was necessarily
                        subject to all the rules which by the laws of nations control a contest of
                        that character, and to all the legitimate consequences following it. One of
                        the consequences was this: Within the limits presented by humanity the
                        conquered rebels were at the mercy of their conquerors. The committee did
                        not deem it necessary or proper to discuss the question whether the late
                        Confederate States are still States of this Union or can ever be otherwise.
                        Grant this profitless abstraction about which so many words have been
                        wasted, it by no means follows that the people of those States may not place
                        themselves in a condition to abrogate the powers and privileges incident to
                        a State of the Union, and deprive themselves of all pretense of right to
                        exercise their power and enjoy their privileges.</p>
                    <p>The committee maintain no portion of the people of this country, whether in a
                        State or Territory, have the right, while remaining on its soil, to withdraw
                        from or reject the authority of the United States. They say it is quite
                        evident from all the facts, and indeed from the whole mass of testimony
                        submitted by the President, that in no instance was any regard paid to any
                        other consideration than obtaining immediate admission to Congress under the
                        barren form of an election, in which no precautions were taken to secure
                        regularity of the proceedings, or the assent of the people.</p>
                    <p>No Constitution has been legally adopted except, perhaps, in the State of
                        Tennessee, and such elections as were held were without authority of law.
                        The committee are accordingly forced to the conclusion that the States
                        referred to have not placed themselves in a condition to claim
                        representation in Congress, unless all the rules which have, since the
                        foundation of the Government, been deemed essential in such cases, shall be
                        disregarded. The committee then review, at length, the condition and feeling
                        of the Southern people, saying, among other things, the latter claim as a
                        right the privilege of participating at once in the Government which for
                        four years they sought to overthrow, while their press abounds in abuse of
                        the loyal States, and efforts are made to perpetuate the deadly hate and
                        discord between the two sections, and excite hostility against the Federal
                        Union.</p>
                    <p>The report, which is a long one, concludes as follows, which may be regarded
                        as a summary of the whole case:</p>
                    <p>"The evidence of an intense hostility to the Federal Union, and an equally
                        intense love of the late Confederacy, nurtured by the war, is decisive.
                        While it appears that nearly all are willing to submit at least for the time
                        being, to Federal authority, it is equally clear that the ruling motive is a
                        desire to obtain the advantage which will be derived from a representation
                        in Congress. Officers of the Union army on duty, and Northern men who go
                        South to engage in business, are generally detested and proscribed. Southern
                        men, who adhere to the Union, are bitterly hated and relentlessly
                        persecuted. In some localities prosecutions have been instituted in State
                        Courts against Union officers for acts done in the line of official duty,
                        and similar prosecutions are threatened elsewhere as soon as the United
                        States troops are removed.</p>
                    <p>All such demonstrations show a state of feeling against which it is
                        unmistakably necessary to guard. The testimony is conclusive that after the
                        collapse of the Confederacy the feeling of the people of the rebellious
                        States was that of abject submission. Having appealed to the tribunal of
                        arms, they had no hope except that by the magnanimity of their conquerors,
                        their lives and possibly their property might be preserved. Unfortunately,
                        the general issue of pardons to persons who had been prominent in the
                        rebellion, and the feeling of kindliness and conciliation manifested by the
                        Executive, and very generally indicated throughout the Northern press, had
                        the effect to render whole communities forgetful of the crime they had
                        committed.</p>
                    <p>Defiant towards the Federal Government and regardless of their duties as
                        citizens, the conciliatory measures of the Government do not seem to have
                        been met, even half way. The bitterness and defiance exhibited towards the
                        United States under such circumstances is without a parallel in the history
                        of the world. In return for our leniency, we receive only an insulting
                        denial of our authority. In return for our kind desire for the resumption of
                        fraternal relations, we receive only an insolent assumption of rights and
                        privileges long since forfeited. The crime we have punished is paraded as a
                        virtue, and the principles of republican government, which we have
                        vindicated at so terrible a cost, are denounced as unjust and oppressive.</p>
                    <p>If we add to this evidence the fact that although peace has been declared by
                        the President, he has not to this day deemed it safe to restore the writ of
                        habeas corpus, to relieve the insurrectionary States of martial law, nor to
                        withdraw the troops from many localities, and that the commanding general
                        deems an increase of the army indispensable to the preservation of order and
                        the protection of loyal and well disposed people in the South, the proof of
                        a condition of feeling hostile to the Union and dangerous to the Government
                        throughout the insurrectionary States would seem to be alarming.</p>
                    <p>We now propose to restate as briefly as possible the several facts and
                        principles applicable to all the States recently in rebellion.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">First</emph>--The seats of Senators and Representatives
                        from the so-called Confederate States became vacant in the year 1861, during
                        the second session of the Thirty-sixth Congress, by the voluntary withdrawal
                        of their incumbents, with the sanction and by the direction of their
                        respective States.</p>
                    <p>This was done as a hostile act against the Constitution and Government of the
                        United States, with a declared intent to overthrow the same by forming a
                        Southern Confederation. This act of declared hostility was speedily followed
                        by an organization of the same States with a confederacy which lived and
                        waged war by sea and land against the United States. This war continued more
                        than four years, within which period the rebel armies besieged the National
                        Capital, invaded the loyal States, burned their towns and cities, robbed
                        their citizens, destroyed more than two hundred and fifty thousand loyal
                        soldiers, and imposed an increased national burden of not less than
                        $3,500,000,000, of which seven or eight hundred millions have already been
                        met and paid. From the time these Confederate States thus withdrew from
                        their representation in Congress, and levied war against the United States,
                        the great mass of their people became and were insurgents, traitors, and all
                        of them assumed and occupied the political, legal and practical relation of
                        enemies of the United States. This position is established by acts of
                        Congress and judicial decisions, and is recognized repeatedly by the
                        President in public proclamations, documents and speeches.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Second</emph>--The States thus confederated prosecuted
                        their war against the United States to final arbitrament, and did not cease
                        until all their armies were captured, their military power destroyed, their
                        civil officers, State and Confederate, taken prisoners or put to flight,
                        every vestige of State and Confederate Government obliterated, their
                        territory overrun and occupied by the Federal armies, and their people
                        reduced to the condition of enemies conquered in war, entitled only by
                        public law to such rights, privileges and conditions as might be vouchsafed
                        by the conqueror. This position is also established by judicial decisions,
                        and is recognized by the President in public proclamations, documents, and
                        speeches.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Third</emph>--Having voluntarily deprived themselves of
                        representation in Congress, for the criminal purpose of destroying the
                        Federal Union, and having reduced themselves, by the act of levying war, to
                        the condition of public enemies, they have no right to complain of temporary
                        exclusion from Congress; but, on the contrary, having voluntarily renounced
                        their right to representation, and disqualified themselves by crime from
                        participating in the Government, the burden now rests upon them, before
                        claiming to be reinstated in their former conditions to show that they are
                        qualified to resume Federal relations. In order to do this they must prove
                        that they have established, with the consent of the people, republican forms
                        of government, in harmony with the Constitution and laws of the United
                        States; that old hostile purposes have ceased, and should give adequate
                        guarantees against future treason and rebellion, which will prove
                        satisfactory to the Government against which they rebelled and by whose arms
                        they were subdued.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Fourth</emph>--Having by this treasonable withdrawal from
                        Congress, and by flagrant rebellion and war, forfeited all civil and
                        political rights and privileges under the Federal Constitution, they can
                        only be restored thereto by the permission and authority of that
                        constitutional power against which they rebelled, and by which they were
                        subdued.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Fifth</emph>--These rebellious armies were conquered by
                        the people of the United States, acting through all the co-ordinate branches
                        of the Government, and not by the Executive department alone. The powers of
                        Congress are not so vested in the President that he can fix and regulate the
                        terms of settlement and confer Congressional representation upon conquered
                        rebels and traitors, nor can he in any way qualify enemies of the Government
                        to exercise its law-making power. The authority to restore rebels to
                        political power in the Federal Government can be exercised only with the
                        concurrence of all the departments in which political power is vested, and
                        hence the several proclamations of the President to the people of the
                        Confederate States cannot be considered as extending beyond the purposes
                        declared, and can only be regarded as provisional permission by the
                        Commander-in-Chief of the army to do certain acts, the validity whereof is
                        to be determined by the Constitutional Government, and not solely by the
                        executive power.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Sixth</emph>--The question before Congress is, then,
                        whether conquered enemies have the right, and shall be permitted, at their
                        own pleasure, and on their own terms, to participate in making laws for
                        their conquerors; whether conquered rebels may change their theatre of
                        operations from the battle field, where they were defeated and overthrown,
                        to the halls of Congress, and their representatives seize the Government
                        which they sought to destroy; whether the National Treasury, the army of the
                        nation, its navy, its forts and arsenals, its whole civil administrations,
                        its credits, its pensioners, the widows and orphans of those who perished in
                        the war, the public honor, peace and safety, shall all be turned over to the
                        keeping of its recent enemies without delay and without imposing such
                        conditions as in the opinion of Congress the security of the country and its
                        institutions may demand.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Seventh</emph>--The history of mankind exhibits no
                        example of such madness and folly. The instinct of self-preservation
                        protests against it. The surrender by Grant to Lee, and by Sherman to
                        Johnston, would have been disasters of less magnitude; for new armies could
                        have been raised, new battles fought, and the Government saved. The
                        anti-coercive policy which, under the pretense of avoiding blood-shed,
                        allowed the rebellion to take form and gather force, would be surpassed in
                        infamy by the matchless wickedness that would now surrender the halls of
                        Congress to those so recently in rebellion until proper precautions shall
                        have been taken to secure the National faith and the National safety.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Eighth</emph>--It has been shown in this report and in
                        the evidence submitted no proof has been afforded to Congress of a
                        constituency in any of the so-called Confederate States, unless we except
                        the State of Tennessee, qualified to elect Senators and Representatives in
                        Congress. No State Constitution or amendment to a State Constitution has had
                        the sanction of the people. All the so-called legislation of the State
                        Conventions and Legislatures has been had under military dictation. If the
                        President may at his will and under his own authority, whether as military
                        commander or chief executive, qualify persons to appoint Senators and elect
                        Representatives, and empower others to appoint and elect them, he thereby
                        practically controls the organization of the legislative department. The
                        constitutional forms of Government are, therefore, practically destroyed,
                        and its powers absorbed in the Executive, and while your committee do not
                        for a moment impute to the President any such design, but cheerfully concede
                        to him the most patriotic motives, they cannot but look with alarm upon a
                        precedent so fraught with danger to the Republic.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Ninth</emph>--The necessity of providing adequate
                        safeguards for the future, before restoring the insurrectionary States to a
                        participation in the direction of public affairs, is apparent from the
                        bitter hostility to the Government and people of the United States yet
                        existing throughout the conquered territory, as proved incontestably by the
                        testimony of so many witnesses, and by undisputed facts.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Tenth</emph>--The conclusion of your committee,
                        therefore, is that the so-called Confederate States are not at present
                        entitled to representation in the Congress of the United States, and that
                        before allowing such representation adequate security for future peace and
                        safety should be required; that this can only be found in such changes of
                        the organic law as shall determine the civil rights and privileges of the
                        citizens in all parts of the Republic; shall place representation on an
                        equal basis, shall fix a stigma upon treason, and protect the loyal people
                        against future claims for the expenses incurred in support of the rebellion
                        and for manumitted slaves; together with an express grant of power in
                        Congress to enforce these provisions. To this end they offer a joint
                        resolution for amending the Constitution of the United States, and the two
                        several bills designed to carry the same into effect before referred to.</p>
                    <p>Before closing this report, your committee beg leave to state that the
                        specific recommendations submitted by them are the result of concession,
                        after a long and careful comparison of conflicting opinions. Upon a question
                        of such magnitude, infinitely important as it is to the future of the
                        Republic, it was not to be expected that all should think alike. Sensible of
                        the imperfections of the scheme, your committee submit to Congress, as the
                        best they could agree upon, in the hope that its imperfections may be cured
                        and its deficiencies supplied by legislative wisdom, and that, when finally
                        adopted, it may tend to restore peace and harmony to the whole country and
                        to place our republican institutions on a more stable foundation.</p>

                <excerpt/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>A telegraph dispatch from Harrisburg announces that the Supreme Court of this
                        State, now sitting in Wilkesbarre, delivered the decision of the court last
                        week in the case of Huber vs. Reilly, by which the hopes of the loyal people
                        that desertion would be punished in some measure commensurate with its
                        merits, are disappointed. We have not been able to get the opinion of the
                        court to ascertain just what has been decided, and on what grounds the
                        decision has been made; but the dispatch states that, while the court does
                        not argue the question of the constitutionality of the law of Congress, it
                        is nevertheless decided by a majority of the judges--Justices Read and Agnew
                        dissenting--that election boards cannot reject a man's vote until he has
                        been tried and convicted as a deserter. If so, the court must have held that
                        the act of Congress disfranchising deserters does so without "due process of
                        law," and whatever may be the language of the court, it practically sets
                        aside a solemn enactment of the national legislature, on the ground that it
                        conflicts with some provision of the constitution.</p>
                    <p>Practically this decision is a universal amnesty to all who, in the hour of
                        the nation's peril, denied the government the service it was compelled to
                        demand of its citizens upon entire equality in point of civil rights, with
                        the faithful men who rescued their nationality from the deadly grasp of
                        treason. If it shall stand the test of the Supreme Court of the United
                        States--where the question must ultimately be carried--then is the skulking
                        deserter able to defy the penalties imposed by the authority he has
                        insolently disregarded, and his citizenship is unimpaired, notwithstanding
                        he refused the allegiance he owes to the government that protects him and
                        his family in their civil, religious and social rights.</p>
                    <p>To say that deserters may be disfranchised after trail and conviction is to
                        surrender the whole question and proclaim every deserter pardoned. By the
                        conscription law Mr. Reilly was in the military service as soon as he was
                        drafted, and subject to the rules and articles of war, and yet the Court of
                        Pennsylvania assumes to limit and nullify them. He must be tried and
                        convicted, but how? If the articles of war should come in conflict with the
                        sovereignty of Pennsylvania, his trial, according to the recent decision,
                        would be illegal. If the civil tribunals should undertake to try and convict
                        Mr. Reilly, the same court would set aside the proceedings because he was in
                        the military service and his offence is not cognizable in the civil courts;
                        and if military tribunals should be ordered to try the deserters, we should
                        most likely next be judicially informed that the war is over, the army is
                        discharged, and citizens can no longer be tried by court-martial. Viewed in
                        any aspect the case can be presented, we must accept the conclusion that
                        practical decision is that deserters cannot be disfranchised or punished.</p>
                    <p>It is true that we have an act of the last legislature imposing penalties
                        upon election officers for accepting such votes, and also upon deserters for
                        offering their votes; and that law, being as yet unquestioned judicially, is
                        the law of the State; but the recent decision of course declares in advance,
                        that the act of the State will be set aside as soon as the Supreme Court can
                        get a chance to do so.</p>
                    <p>We presume that the effect of the decision in our political struggles will
                        not be material. On the one side there is an act of Congress and an act of
                        the legislature, and on the other side a decision of a divided State Court,
                        and it is probable that deserters will be disfranchised in some districts
                        and vote in others, as heretofore. While there is a palpable conflict of
                        authority upon a question so vital, and justice pleads on the one side
                        against perfidy shielded by legal technicalities on the other side,
                        uniformity of practice under the law cannot be attained. The people of
                        Pennsylvania, as a rule, are proverbially law-abiding, and they will
                        cheerfully yield their convictions and their sense of justice to the final
                        adjudication of any question. We regret this decision, therefore, not only
                        because we believe it to be wrong in point of law, but especially because it
                        defeats the harmonious action we fondly hoped to see between the States and
                        the Nation in the punishment of the crime of desertion.</p>

                    <p>Justice John M. Read has filed the following dissenting opinion in the case
                        of Huber vs. Reily:<lb/> Benjamin Huber vs. Henry Reily. Supreme Court.
                        Middle district. Error to the Common Plea of Franklin county.</p>
                    <p>READ, J.--This court have declared the act of Congress of March 3, 1863, for
                        "enrolling and calling out the national forces and for other purposes" to be
                        constitutional. For similar reasons to those assigned for our decision, I
                        consider the act of Congress of the 24th February, 1864, to amend said
                        act--the act of July 4, 1864, "further to regulate and provide for the
                        enrolling and calling out the national forces and for other purposes"--and
                        the "act to amend the several acts heretofore calling out the national
                        forces and for other purposes," passed March 3, 1865, to be
                        constitutional--and necessary and proper exercises of the power of Congress
                        to put down a rebellion which, if it had proved successful, would have split
                        this great and powerful Union into a dozen insignificant confederacies.</p>
                    <p>I regard the 21st section of the last-named act as clearly constitutional,
                        for the right to punish with death involves the right to impose inferior
                        punishments and disabilities not expressly prohibited by the Constitution of
                        the United States. A deserter coming within this section forfeits <emph
                            rend="italic">his right of citizenship</emph> and his right to become a
                        citizen of the United States.</p>
                    <p>The facts stated in the case before us <emph rend="italic">and
                        admitted</emph>, show that the plaintiff had never taken advantage of the
                        proclamation of the President, <emph rend="italic">and was a
                        deserter</emph>, and therefore not a citizen of the United States. The case
                        therefore is one of a person <emph rend="italic">acknowledged not to
                        be</emph> a citizen of the United States offering to vote, and his vote is
                        refused; can he sustain an action for this rejection against the election
                        officers?</p>
                    <p>The Constitution of Pennsylvania, as a qualification for an elector, requires
                        in addition to residence, that he should be a citizen of the United States;
                        and with this admitted fact can it be said that the defendant was bound to
                        take an illegal vote prohibited by our fundamental law?--The act of Congress
                        does not touch the right of suffrage--the prohibition originates with our
                        own Constitution, which prevents aliens, strangers, and all persons not
                        citizens of the United States from voting.</p>
                    <p>I entertain, therefore, no doubt that the vote of Mr. Reily was properly
                        rejected; but owing to the difficulties of deciding such questions at polls,
                        where facts are disputed, I am glad to find that the Legislature have passed
                        an act providing for the proper evidence in such cases.</p>
                    <p>I must express my deep regret that the learned counsel of the plaintiff, a
                        gentleman of the most estimable character, has permitted himself in his
                        printed brief to make use of language in relation to this act, and to the
                        Congress of the United States, not called for by the occasion or justified
                        by the conduct of the Supreme Legislative body of the American nation.<lb/>
                        I would reverse this judgment.</p>

                <summary>It is reported that Rev. McElwee, formerly of Chambersburg, was recently
                    arrested in Philadelphia and charged with embezzlement. McElwee was alleged to
                    have appropriated money from his church, funds that were collected for
                    charitable purposes. When the case came up last week, however, McElwee was
                    discharged without trial after the district attorney examined the testimony and
                    deemed that the defendant's only offence was an "error of judgement in supposing
                    he had a right to exercise a discretion in the distribution of the fund."</summary>
