<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The tame Republicans held a
                        meeting in Richmond on the 25th ult and were addressed by
                        Gilbert C. Walker, Candidate for Governor, Jno. B. Crenshaw and Franklin
                        Stearns.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Walker accepted the nomination tendered him by the "Grant Administration
                        Republicans," as he styled those who signed the address nominating him. He
                        proclaimed himself, and the other Republicans who were with him, as not only
                        accepting the situation but "wishing to see the
                        reconstruction laws faithfully executed." He said
                        in reference to the Underwood Constitution he was opposed to the disqualification, test-oath and county organization clauses. As to the colored people he was in
                        favor of placing them on an equality civil and
                            political with the whites.</p>
                    <p>From this exposition of principles by their leader, we can see but very
                        little difference between them and the Wells party. Many of the Wells party
                        will vote against the test oath and disqualification clauses and would
                        doubtlessly vote against the county organization clause if submitted
                        separately. But it is not to be submitted separately. A committee of
                        Walkerites after the manner of the Committee of nine, are besieging Congress
                        to order a separate vote on this clause, but we incline to the belief that
                        they will meet with as little success as the Nine. On the question of
                        equality, civil and political, the Walkerites come up fully to the Wells
                        party in theory, but fail to carry the theory into practice. The difference
                        between them only amounts to having a ticket composed of mere respectable
                        men. The conservative who supports this ticket, then, as certainly and
                        surely endorses the Republican dogmas, as if he supported the Wells party.
                        It amounts to this and nothing less. No amount of quibbling can get out of
                        it.--And yet the "respectables" beseech us to unite with them in supporting
                        the Republican doctrines, with which we have nothing in common. Stand aloof
                        from this, men of Virginia, if you do not wish to sell out the old state,
                        bag and baggage, to the Republican party. If you unite with it you are,
                        beyond controversy, allied with the Republican party. You will have gone
                        into it with your eyes open and thereby knowingly saddled yourself with the
                        onus of its monstrosities, and its oppressions of the unfortunate South.
                        Beware of taking this step and placing yourselves in a position that you
                        would, if in your power, give the labor of a lifetime to withdraw from.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>At a meeting of the resident members of the Conservative Executive Committee,
                        held in Richmond, on the 25th ult., the following preamble and resolution
                        were adopted:</p>
                    <p>Whereas at a meeting of the Conservative Executive Committee of the State in
                        December, 1868, it was resolved that it was inexpedient to take any decided
                        action until Congress had fixed some day for an election in Virginia, and
                        the resident Committee in Richmond was directed to convene the General
                        Committee at an early day after such fixed purpose of this Committee to call
                        such a meeting in the event of such action by Congress.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, resolved, that it is the earnest request of this Committee to the
                        Conservative voters of the State to adhere to the organization and resolves
                        heretofore established and proclaimed.</p>
                    <p>R.T. Daniel</p>
                    <p>Chairman</p>
                    <p>This has the ring of the true metal about it. There is no wishy-washy
                        pandering to to the powers that be in these resolutions, but an
                        evidence of determined purpose, on the part of those who were charged with
                        guidance of the most unanimous party organization in Virginia, to manfully
                        contend for their rights against the horde of carpetbaggers and scalawags
                        that infest our State, at every city, town and cross roads.</p>
                    <p>There is a peculiar significance in this action at this time. The Republican
                        party is split and the gap widens daily. This action looks to taking
                        advantage of this split to secure the defeat of the most obnoxious
                        constitution offered to any Southern State. The Committee have not
                        slept--only bided their time. They now counsel adherence to the organization
                        and the resolves heretofore proclaimed. This is wise, for, if we stand
                        together, we can defeat the Underwood Constitution, with all its odious
                        features, beyond a peradventure. It is also opportune, for, in the fear that
                        the Conservative executive Committee would do nothing further, many might be
                        forced to choose between the two Republican evils. They now have the
                        assurance needed. Then let every man who would defend the right against the
                        wrong, who looks with exultant pride on the glorious past of the beloved Old
                        Dominion, and would see her future painted in still more gorgeous colors,
                        avoid being entrapped by the insidious arguments of the Walkerites and stand
                        by the only organization which proposes to battle, and that manfully, for
                        Virginia's time-honored and time-acknowledged rights and does not propose to
                        tarnish her fair fame.</p>

                    <p>We have received a number of letters from all portions of this County
                        endorsing the stand we have taken against the Walker movement and those who
                        signed the address. An answer seems demanded to some of them and, as we can
                        not answer each one separately, we copy the following and ask that our reply
                        to it may suffice for all:</p>
                    <p>Augusta Va,<br> March 27th, 1869.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Editor:--</p>
                    <p>We are more than pleased, in this proximity, with the course pursued by the
                        "Vindicator" in regard to the signers of the late Republican address of
                        Hannicutt, Dews, Gilmer &amp; Co., and to the Walker movement generally.
                        We trust you will pursue the same course in similar cases. I also deem it
                        but due to you to state that your course meets with the hearty endorsation,
                        not only of the people of this section, but of every portion of glorious old
                        Augusta. I have been among them and know that of which I speak.</p>
                    <p>
                        Respecfully
                    </p>
                    <p>We have never pursued any course for the purpose of winning popular approval,
                        and the endorsation of the people is the more gratifying on that score. We
                        return our thanks to the many who have addressed us words of encouragement.
                        We shall, to the best of our ability, defend the interests and honor of our
                        people and shall, if possible, give timely notes of warning, that they may
                        ward off impending dangers to either.</p>
                    <p>We are satisfied that the policy heretofore pursued by the press, for the
                        sake of peace and quiet--to smoothe over the public acts of individuals
                        rather than to censure--is dangerous, in these times especially, and as for
                        ourselves we are done with it. We shall, however, avoid, as much as
                        possible, anything personal as to the private acts of individuals, save
                        where they trench on the rights of the people and the welfare of community,
                        but public acts are public property and we shall deem it our legitimate
                        right to use them, to critcise, praise or condemn.--When there is
                        ulceration and cauterizing will relive we shall only cauterize but if
                        necessary to affect a cure we shall not hesitate to use the knife.</p>
                    <p>Trusting this plain statement may satisfactorily answer one and all, I may
                        also express the hope (which each and every one will doubtless endorse,)
                        that even cauterization may not be necessary hereafter.</p>
