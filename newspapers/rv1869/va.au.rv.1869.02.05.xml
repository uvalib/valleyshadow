                    <p>The Church question brought before the Reconstruction Committee by the
                        Committee of Nine called out the Rev. Mr. Phelps of this place, who, in his
                        remarks before the Reconstruction Committee, is reported to have said that
                        "Some of his brother preachers in this section were under the necessity of
                        wearing pistols in the pulpit and also to have charged "as a case of cruelty
                        to the blacks that the white Methodists here had excluded the blacks from
                        the Church."</p>
                    <p>Col. Baldwin, being re-called before the Reconstruction Committee, at the
                        instance of Mr. Norris, of Alabama, (?) for cross-examination, asked
                        permission also to make a statement in reference to Mr. Phelps' remark and
                        quoted from the testimony of Mr. Phelps, at the investigation held here by
                        order of Gen. Stoneman, in reference to the Methodist Church property in
                        this place, in which Mr. Phelps stated "that he had always been treated with
                        kindness and respect and had never been molested in any manner in Virginia."
                        He also quoted from the evidence of Aaron Shoveler, colored, given at the
                        same time, in which Shoveler stated "that the negro members of the Methodist
                        church in Staunton had selected a negro preacher, formed their own
                        communion, joined the northern African Conference, and declined to
                        contribute to the support of the old church and its minister before they
                        were informed that they could not be permitted to use the old church as a
                        place of worship, and that then the white members as well as other white
                        citizens contributed liberally towards the purchase of a new place of
                        worship for them."</p>
                    <p>This, it is claimed by correspondents, refutes the testimony given by Mr.
                        Phelps before the reconstruction Committee.</p>
                    <p>We give the above concise statement as the most correct we have seen of what
                            <sic>tranpired</sic>.</p>
                    <p>In this connection we take the occasion, as but a simple act of justice, to
                        correct an error into which the Dispatch, and others of our exchanges have
                        fallen in reference to Mr. Phelps. He can not be denominated a
                        "carpet-bagger," as he is a native of Frederick Co Va, owns a farm there and
                        we learn has spent the greater portion of his life in this state.</p>

                    <p>On Saturday last the Lower House of Congress passed the following joint
                        resolution:</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Be it resolution, &amp;c., (two-thirds of both houses
                            concurring,)</emph> That the following article be proposed to the
                        Legislatures of the several States as an amendment to the Constitution of
                        the United States, which, when ratified by three-fourths of said
                        Legislatures, shall be held as part of said constitution, namely:</p>
                    <p>ARTICLE--</p>
                    <p>SEC. 1.--The right of any citizen of the United States to vote shall not be
                        denied or abridged by the United States, or any State by reason of race,
                        color, or previous condition of slavery of any citizens or class of citizens
                        of the United States.</p>
                    <p>SEC. 2. The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation,
                        the provisions of this article.</p>
                    <p>This is universal suffrage in a nut shell and is just what we anticipated. It
                        was a brazen face indeed that would force universal suffrage, at the point
                        of the bayonet, on the prostrate South, whose interest and prosperity it
                        affects vitally and would withhold it in the North, where the principle is
                        the only thing that can be contested. Hence we looked for just such a
                        proposition. What favor it will meet with in the Senate remains to be seen.
                        In all probability it will be forced through. Then comes the real contest.
                        The Northern people have exhibited great opposition to negro suffrage and
                        many of their Legislatures will refuse to ratify the amendment. Enough,
                        however, we believe will ratify it, together with the Southern State
                        Legislatures, filled as they are with carpet-baggers and manhoods, which
                        will assuredly do so, to make its adoption as a part of the constitution
                        sure. Those Northern States which refuse will then be in the category of the
                        South--under the dominion of an inferior race and if there is not some
                        kicking in the traces we shall be astonished. Its constitutionality will
                        likely be tested and every effort be made to wrest the country from its dire
                        effects. It will take time, but the door once opened to the wanton
                        assumptions of a fractional Congress will redound to the ultimate good of
                        the country. That such will be the result, if the joint resolution passes
                        the Senate, we do not doubt and shall watch its course with interest.
                        Perhaps the services of the Committee of nine may be needed in a new
                        field--aiding in the reconstruction of refractory Northern States on the
                        basis of universal suffrage.</p>
