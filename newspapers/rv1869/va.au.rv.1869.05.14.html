<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
<p>Although opposing the Underwood Constitution, out and out, each and every feature of which is objectionable and oppressive, yet we have felt some little anxiety to learn what features would be submitted to a separate vote and how they were to be submitted.</p>
<p>This subject for a few days past, says the latest dispatches, has claimed the attention of the Cabinet.  After postponing the matter from day to day for several days, the dispatches report a decision, and such a decision!  How admirably have our expediency men managed affairs! But to the dispatch.  It says:</p>
<p>"It seems to be determined that the disfranchising clause of the Virginia constitution is the only one that will be submitted to a separate vote."</p>
<p>
Only the disfranchising clause to be submitted to a separate vote! If this be true and the final decision, are our compeers, who have been won over to expediency at so late a day, prepared to advise the adoption of the remainder?  Will they swallow all the other abominations to secure reconstruction, which to them seems a panacea for all the ills that flesh is heir to?  Or will they come around again and assist us manfully in defeating the whole batch of abominations by voting down the entire Underwood Constitution?</p>
<p>We think they will have to decide this speedily by coming back to first principles, unless they can get the Committee of Nine to return to Washington at once and relieve (?) them of their dilemma.</p>
