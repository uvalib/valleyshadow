                    <p>Tuesday next is election day. On that day it is to be decided whether a
                        number of whites in Virginia are to have equal privileges with their former
                        servants.</p>
                    <p> Then will be submitted to a separate vote the disfranchising and disability
                        clauses. There is not a man in the State, with any sense of justice and fair
                        dealing in his composition, be he white or black, who desires to see his
                        friends and neighbors remain disfranchised or disabled from holding
                        positions of trust and honor by abominable test-oaths. All such will vote
                            <emph rend="italic">against</emph> these separate clauses. </p>
                    <p> Those who vote <emph rend="italic">for</emph> these clauses, will do so with
                        their eyes open. They will throw the first stone. If they should find that
                        the stone has rebounded and struck down those who threw it, let them not cry
                        out. That it will rebound, who, knowing human nature, can doubt? In every
                        community, in this particular time, every man likely to cast such a vote is
                        known. The number so cast will aid in fixing the onus where it should rest.
                        If those suspected of casting such a vote fail to get employment or
                        patronage in the future, which will surely be the result, they must not
                        complain, for they themselves wrought their own pecuniary destruction. </p>
                    <p>We were taken to task some time since by a "carpet-bag" Journal, for calling
                        attention to the necessary result of such votes. We have only to say to all
                        such cavilers that human nature is human nature. That Northern Manufacturers
                        employ none who do not vote as they wish, or dismiss all who vote against
                        their party. A Radical member of the Cabinet has lately discharged a number
                        who voted the Democratic ticket. And in an election in which party questions
                        are lost sight of, to a great extent, in matters more nearly personal, where
                        the effect is being made to relieve a number of our best citizens from their
                        disfranchisement and disabilities, it is far more reasonable and more nearly
                        right that those who vote to retain the disfranchisement and test-oath
                        clauses should neither be patronized or employed. At any rate such will be
                        the case. Carpet-bags may gape and growl, but we warn the men inclined to
                        vote for disfranchisement and test-oaths, to consider well what they propose
                        to do. Something will drop as sure as fate and we warn you not to be caught
                        in the dead-fall.</p>

                <summary>This article warns those who consider voting for the disfranchisement and
                    disability clauses in the upcoming election. Actions of this sort are certain to
                    "rebound" and these people will undoubtedly suffer the pecuniary consequences.
                    For example, these people will neither be patronized nor employed.</summary>

                <transcript>
                    <p>On Monday last, Col. Gilbert C. Walker, Candidate for Governor, agreeably to
                        previous announcement, addressed the people of Augusta in the Court House.
                        There was an immense throng present, the Court House being densely crowded.
                        There was a number of colored persons present.</p>
                    <p>Col.Walker was introduced by Hon A.H.H. Stuart and made a plain, candid and
                        bold speech, repeating the points he had made elsewhere. He declared his
                        utter detestation of the Disfranchising and Test oath clauses and his
                        earnest opposition to the remainder of the Constitution and his acceptance
                        of it only because he believes it the best course to pursue. He made a very
                        decided impression and the crowd were very enthusiastic.</p>
                    <p>Maj. Jas. B. Dorman, of Lexington followed in a fine address.</p>
                    <p> Col. Baldwin being called for, proposed to have a "love feast," and called
                        on the following gentlemen, who responded, endorsing the speech of Col.
                        Walker, and advising the people to vote for him: Col. J.H. Skinner, Col.
                        Bolivar Christian, Maj. H.M. Bell, Maj, Thos C. Elder, Thos. J. Michie, Col.
                        Geo. Baylor, and Mr. Wm. S. Gilmam of the <emph rend="italic">Richmond
                        Whig.</emph></p>
                    <p>Col. Baldwin closed the "love feast" with a spirited speech.</p>
                    <p>Judging from the spirit manifested on Monday, Col. Walker will carry Augusta,
                        by a very large majority.</p>

                    Several prominent citizens delivered addresses including Col. Walker, Maj.

                        <emph rend="italic">Composed of the Counties of Frederick, Clarke, Warren,
                            Page, Shenandoah, Rockingham, Augusta, Highland, Bath, Alleghany,
                            Rockbridge and Botetourt.</emph>
                    </p>
                    <p>Fellow-Citizens: The general confusion in our town on Wednesday last, and the
                        rumor freely circulated to my injury, that I had withdrawn as a candidate
                        for Congress in this District, renders it necessary that I should issue from
                        the press this additional card.</p>
                    <p> Mr. Lewis has withdrawn, and although unexpressed publicly, I believe in my
                        favor. I did agree with him to withdraw, provided the people of the District
                            <emph rend="italic">would</emph> have a candidate with disabilities; and
                        provided that the gallant Confederate soldier, F.W.M. Holliday, of Frederick
                        county, with his disabilities, would consent to run. He is a gentleman and a
                        scholar. He shed his blood in the Southern cause, and was rash in his desire
                        to shed it, and if you <emph rend="italic">will</emph> have a man with
                        disabilities, in God's name, have a man that you know where to find, and who
                        served you faithfully in your hour, of trial. For such a man I withdraw, and
                        he can depend upon my support. </p>
                    <p>In my card of Wednesday, words were used in speaking of John F. Lewis,
                        perhaps under momentary excitement, which I desire here, unsolicited, to
                        withdraw, and to commend him to you as a candidate on your State ticket in
                        every way worthy of your enthusiastic support.</p>
                    <p> I wish you all to understand that for you I am fighting along the line. I am
                        the Conservative, Walker ticket, <emph rend="italic">white man's</emph>
                        candidate, and will not withdraw unless a convention rule me off, or for
                        Holliday, who is in every respect worthy your support, and not a man like
                        Harris, who during the war, and now, will not let his friends or foes
                        understand him. Is he anxious to secure the Wells and negro vote? Let him
                        have them! I neither ask, expect, or desire the vote of a single Wells negro
                        in the District. I neither ask, expect or desire the vote of a single Wells
                        white man in the District. I would rather be defeated with the Conservative
                        vote for me, than elected with the vote of Wells white men and the Wells
                        negroes. I am an enthusiastic Walker ticket man; the white man's candidate
                        for the public good. I have by this action willingly thrown off possibly
                        four thousand votes. I have a right to expect the white Virginia men to
                        rally around me. I have a right to expect the undivided Walker ticket vote
                        of the District; and I tell you, if I don't receive it, a Radical or a negro
                        will represent your interest in Congress. Men of Shenandoah, Rockbridge and
                        Botetourt, where I have been, listen to what I say, and believe me. I am
                        your friend, because I believe you are willing to do the best you can, and
                        rescue the old Commonwealth from the hand of the barbarian, and her citizens
                        who just now are in danger of being welcomed "with bloody hands to
                        hospitable graves." </p>
                    <p>Tell me, some friend of John T. Harris, what was the result of his private
                        interview with Wells on yesterday when I and others were honestly casting
                        flowers upon the Confederate graves as the graves of brave men? Was he
                        seeking the negro vote, or was he simply getting into Wells good graces that
                        he might get the radical influence toward the removal of his disabilities by
                        Congress in the event of his election? Or was he calculating upon the
                        election of the Wells ticket, and a Radical Legislature, and thinking how
                        important it was to be on his right side, as he would have to nominate the
                        Judges? Would he take the Judgeship through Wells and the Radical
                        Legislature? Does he desire that the Radical league shall not make a
                        nomination now for Congress, so that they will treat him as their nominee? I
                        answer every question asked me; why won't he? The people have a right to
                        demand it. It was demanded as a right of Cataline when a dogged silence
                        before the Roman Senate.</p>
                    <p>Men of this District I have a convention if you chose. All I ask, is that you
                        nominate a white man, a gentleman and a Virginian. I promise to give him an
                        enthusiastic support, be he Holliday, Baldwin, Stuart, Skinner, Jas. B.
                        Dorman, or any other good man that you can produce in the District. I tell
                        you Gray is all right, and his text, is "for the public good." Still if I am
                        not to your fancy; if I cannot give you satisfaction, have a convention,
                        throw me aside and take a better man. It may be important for us to have a
                        representative to protect Virginia's interest. Don't elect a man who is of
                        doubtful position, or who cannot be sure of his seat who may be sent back
                        because of his disabilities, and the place given to some extreme Radical. If
                        the Radical league don't make a nomination, it is equivalent to a secret
                        nomination of Harris by them, and will be so understood. If the
                        Conservatives don't make a nomination, it should be considered as equivalent
                        to a nomination of Gray by them.</p>
                    <p>I am perfectly willing that between Harris and myself, John F. Lewis shall
                        decide, upon a fair statement of the facts, which shall withdraw. I am
                        perfectly willing that Col. Gilbert C. Walker shall decide; and that I may
                        not be misunderstood, I am perfectly willing that all the facts may be
                        fairly represented, and that Gen. Lee may decide which and what is best for
                        the public good; but I am not willing that Wells and the negro shall decide.</p>
                    <p>White men of the district, elect Robert A. Gray, and he will do the best he
                        can for you; this is a fair contract, and Gray promises to carry out,
                        faithfully, his part of the contract.</p>
                    <p>My position, briefly stated, is this: the great doctrine of "Post 19," for
                        peace and good will, early reconstruction, and future development, flowers

                        whether North or South, whether Union or Confederate, as a grave of a brave
                        man who died for what he thought was the right.</p>

                <summary>This letter from Congressional candidate R.A. Gray urges the citizens of
                    Staunton to cast their votes for him in the upcoming election. He claims that he
                    would withdraw if the convention were to rule him out, or if some other worthy
                    candidates were to be free from disabilities. This message is primarily an
                    attack on the political aims of Judge Harris. Gray feels that Harris has
                    concentrated his efforts on the "negro vote." Gray claims that neither blacks
                    nor Radicals should decide this contest. This, according to Gray, is a white
                    man's district, and he promises to work for the white man's interests.</summary>

                <transcript>
                    <p>Staunton, June 26th, 1869.</p>
                    <p>Dear Sir.--I suppose there can be no doubt the Walker party have it in their
                        power to elect a representative to Congress from this District, but I fear
                        they are about to let the Radicals take control of the District, almost
                        without a struggle.</p>
                    <p>The whole Walker movement is founded, if I understand it, upon a
                        determination, frankly and fairly to accept the situation and in all
                        respects to make the best of it.</p>
                    <p>To elect a man to Congress who, by the Constitution and laws of the United
                        States, is prohibited to hold any office State or Federal, would seem to be
                        flying in the face of the national authority, and would give Congress a
                        substantial reason not only to reject our Representative, but to disregard
                        all votes cast for him, and to give the place to his Radical opponent.</p>
                    <p>If Mr. Conrad, or Judge Harris were eligible to Congress there would be no
                        objection to either of them, though there would be a serious objection to
                        the running of both at the same time. The election of either now, would be
                        simply to hand over the District to the Wells Radicals, for it could hardly
                        be supposed that Congress would remove the disabilities of a Conservative in
                        order to let him take a seat in Congress which a Radical wanted. I had hoped
                        that the Convention called to meet in Harrisonburg, on Monday last, would
                        settle this matter by giving us one eligible Candidate for which all the
                        Walker men could vote, and I have abstained from any agency in the matter
                        for the reason that Mr. Robert A. Gray, the only candidate who is eligible
                        under the Constitution is a near connection and personal friend in whose
                        behalf I disliked to make any public demonstration. As matters now stand, I
                        can see no course left for the Walker men of the district, but to elect Mr.
                        Gray, and to give him such a united vote as to insure the defeat of any
                        Wells Radical who, at the last moment, may be sprung upon us. I have already
                        said that Mr. Gray is a near connection and personal friend of mine. It may
                        not be improper for me to say in addition that while I have not concurred in
                        his opinions, or approved his course during the war, I have always known him
                        to be earnest, and consistent in his union sentiments, and that he is one of
                        the few men in the State who can honestly take the test oath. Since the war,
                        he has, though a Republican in his politics, been earnest, and outspoken in
                        his Virginia sympathies, and he was one of the first to fall into the Walker
                        movement. He has the capacity to make a good Representative, and, if
                        elected, I do not doubt that he would truly, and fairly represent the
                        feelings, and wishes, and interests of the real people of Virginia.</p>
                    <p>I hope it will be the pleasure of the people of the District to solve the
                        difficulty in which we are placed, by electing Mr. Gray.</p>
                    <p>Yours, truly, John B. Baldwin.</p>

                <summary>This letter from J.B. Baldwin supports the candidacy of Robert A. Gray for
                    Congress. While Baldwin recalls his difference of opinion with Gray during the
                    war years, he now claims Gray, who is not restricted by disabilities and
                    eligible to take a Congressional seat if elected, certainly has Virginia's best
                    interests in mind. Despite Gray's Republican leanings, he would be a far better
                    representative than a Radical.</summary>

                    <p>COL. BALDWIN SPEAKS:</p>
                    <p>
                        <emph rend="italic">Fellow Citizens.</emph>
                    </p>
                    <p> If any thing could be regarded as singular and unheard of these days, it
                        would be the letter of Col. Baldwin, to the people of this District,
                        advising them to vote for his brother-in-law Gray, for Congress.
                        First--strange that any man should presume to direct all the voters of the
                        District; second--stranger still that he should overlap the bounds of
                        delicacy and direct them to vote for his brother-in-law. Moreover it is
                        singular that the letter is published just in time for the last issue of
                        each paper in the District, thus giving no time for reply before the
                        election. This letter is not less remarkable in its statements of facts. For
                        instance, in the first sentence it says "I fear they (The Walker party) are
                        about to let Radicals take control of the District without a struggle." From
                        this, the reader would infer there was a Republican in the field. When the
                        fact is, that on last Friday they were to have had a Convention at this
                        place to nominate a candidate and not a single delegate from any other
                        county attended and nothing was done. Consequently they have no Candidate
                        and Col. Baldwin knows that, for he says further on, A Wells Radical "may at
                        the last moment be sprung upon us."--Again he assumes Mr. Conrad <emph
                            rend="italic">is a candidate</emph> in the face of the fact that he is
                        not regularly announced in any paper in the District and that in answer to a
                        letter requesting him to run and make an <emph rend="italic">active</emph>
                        canvas he answered, saying he would not canvas, but placing his names in the
                        hands of gentlemen written to, the letter published the correspondence,
                        without announcing him and then the matter ends except two Winchester papers
                        have his names at their heads. I refer to the papers of the District for
                        this. So Col. Baldwin <emph rend="italic">creates</emph> the necessity by
                            <emph rend="italic">making two</emph> candidates in order to call upon
                        the people to avoid the dilemma by voting for his "near connection." Again
                        Col. Baldwin announces this to be law. "To elect a man to Congress who by
                        the Constitution and laws of the United States, is prohibited to hold
                        office, State or Federal, would seem to be flying in the face of the
                        national authority (how deferential <emph rend="italic">all at once</emph>
                        to the national authority!) and would give Congress a <emph rend="italic"
                            >substantial</emph> reason not only to reject our representative but to
                        disregard all votes cast for him, and to give place to his radical
                        opponent." This Col. Baldwin announces to be Constitutional law, that if an
                        eligible man receives <emph rend="italic">one hundred votes</emph> and his
                        ineligible opponent receive 25,000, the former would be <emph rend="italic"
                            >entitled</emph> to the seat. For mark, he says it would afford Congress
                        a <emph rend="italic">substantial</emph> reason.--In the discussion of
                        Constitutional questions how can a reason be <emph rend="italic"
                        >substantial</emph> not founded in law. This doctrine is in the face of
                        every decision on the subject. He makes this assertion too, in the face of
                        the fact that a number of southern men have been elected to Congress since
                        the war with disabilities and admitted to their seats. For instance P.M.
                        Young, a Confederate General and a Conservative from Georgia, was admitted
                        to his seat, and further in the face of this fact, during the last winter
                        Mr. Payne of Wisconsin offered a resolution covering precisely Col.
                        Baldwin's view of the law. To wit: that the eligible candidate should be
                        declared elected and disregarding the votes cast for the Candidate under
                        disabilities. This resolution was referred and never heard of again. So
                        Congress <emph rend="italic">refused to do</emph> exactly what Col. Baldwin
                        says <emph rend="italic">they will do.</emph> The Col. ought to look into
                        the proceedings of Congress a little before he makes such sweeping
                        assertions. As to his "near connection" and his "capacity to make a good
                        representative." I have nothing to say. I have ceased to notice him. </p>
                    <p> In conclusion I appeal to the people of the district to vote their
                        sentiments without regard to Col. Baldwin or any body else. Let him vote
                            <emph rend="italic">his own</emph> sentiments but not undertake to vote
                            <emph rend="italic">yours.</emph> Washington issued the <emph
                            rend="italic">first</emph> address of warning to the people, Col.
                        Baldwin the <emph rend="italic">second!</emph> I will be pardoned for
                        stating that it is the first time in the history of this District, that any
                        one man had voluntarily undertaken to influence in behalf of another a whole
                        District of freemen--all his peers in political rights and privileges. The
                        time was, and is yet, in some countries, when Kings ordered their "near
                        connections" to high places and ordered their subjects at will, but that
                        time, thank God! has not come to us yet. The fewest number of men ever known
                        to take the Old Dominion on their shoulders was "NINE" but it seems now the
                        honors are divided out and <emph rend="italic">one</emph> is to say who is
                        to go to Congress. If the Col. had called a "Committee of Nine" on me, the
                        thing <emph rend="italic">would be serious,</emph> but when it comes down to
                        a Committee of <emph rend="italic">one,</emph> I beg to be excused from
                        regarding it. Col. Baldwin having said, if I were eligible there would be no
                        objection to me, I hope after reading my cards on that subject, the people
                        will concur with him and give me their <emph rend="italic">untold</emph>
                        support. </p>

                    including the lack of opposition from a Republican and the unusual timing of the
                    letter. The article recommends that the voter disregard the sentiments of one
