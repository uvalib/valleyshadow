                    <p>We have been frequently interrogated on the subject of the extension of the
                        Stay Law. This subject interests many of our people, perhaps more vitally
                        than any other at present.</p>
                    <p>If Congress receives the State under the constitution lately adopted by the
                        people the Stay Law will cease.</p>
                    <p>With regard to debtors the <emph rend="italic">Lynchburg Virginian</emph>
                        very pointedly says:</p>
                    <p>"There is a great deal of needless apprehension entertained in this State,
                        respecting the effect of the expiration of the Stay Law, which ceases with
                        the acknowledgement by Congress of the new constitution. The opinion
                        prevails that about one-fourth, or a very large portion of the real estate
                        of Virginia will then change hands, at a ruinous sacrifice to the present
                        owners. Those who take this gloomy view of the subject lose sight of the
                        fact that the courts can, to a great extent, control this matter, and
                        interpose to protect the interests of the property holders. In all cases,
                        except where deeds of trust exist, sales of real estate must depend upon a
                        decree of court; and no sales will be permitted if the proceeds of annual
                        rental for a term of years will liquidate the claim on account of principal
                        and interest. But in any case, it is competent for the courts to have
                        property appraised, and to set aside any sale where the value of the
                        property, or something nearly approximating it, has not been secured. This
                        power of the courts is ample to secure landholders against a ruinous
                        sacrifice of their property; and further, we have no doubt that the
                        Legislature will, by appropriate legislation, under the Constitution, see to
                        it that wholesale ruin be not thus inflicted upon the debtors of the
                        Commonwealth."</p>
                    <p>The Debtor class, however, are not likely to be the only class that will be
                        considered in any Legislative action. Creditors will likewise come in for a
                        share of protection. Probably both creditors and debtors will be as nearly
                        equally considered as may be.</p>
                    <p>In any event the debtor, who can relieve himself to any extent from his
                        obligations, by doing so will not be damaged by Legislative action. We
                        therefore advise, all who can, to pay their creditors what they can. Few
                        creditors but would make a very satisfactory arrangement with their debtors
                        on receiving a portion of their old claims. This course would make money
                        easier and conduce to the benefit of all and perhaps not the least to the
                        debtor himself.</p>

                    lead to widespread loss of property. The article explains how the law will work
                    under the new constitution.</summary>

                <summary>The paper prints the report of a military commission on the condition and
                    needs of Virginia's charitable institutions. Dr. Stribling's Western Asylum has
                    340 patients in-house at all times. 81 applicants, 55 women and 26 men, had to
                    be turned away for lack of accommodations. The state legislature had
                    appropriated $60,000 annually to the institution. Patient fees met all other
                    costs. The commission recommended a $30,000 appropriation. Maj. J. C. Covell's
                    Deaf, Dumb, and Blind Institution has 128 students who cost the school $300
                    each. Before the war, the legislature granted the institute $25,000 annually.
                    Covell now has only $10,000 to meet expenses. The commission recommended a
                    $15,000 appropriation.</summary>

                    <p>The following cases were tried in the County Court:</p>
                    <p>Wm. Robinson, colored, charged with breaking into and stealing goods from the
                        store of Hugh Glen &amp; Co. The jury brought in a verdict of guilty,
                        and fixed the punishment at one year's imprisonment in the penitentiary.</p>
                    <p>He was also tried in another case, assault and battery, with intent to kill
                        J. J. Christian, colored. The jury found him guilty and agreed upon a
                        verdict of 5 years in the penitentiary. The court deeming the verdict
                        excessive, set it aside and granted the prisoner a new trial.</p>
                    <p>John Minor, colored, charged with house-breaking, tried and convicted by the
                        jury, but on motion for arrest of judgement, on account of the absence of
                        one of justices who sat on the trial, the court set aside the verdict and
                        the prisoner was discharged.</p>
                    <p>Frank Williams, colored, tried on the charge of attempted rape. The jury
                        returned a verdict of not guilty.</p>
                    <p>W. H. Pelton and Wm. Bond, (colored) charged with petit larceny. Jury
                        returned a verdict of guilty and the courts sentenced them to 60 days'
                        imprisonment in County jail.</p>
