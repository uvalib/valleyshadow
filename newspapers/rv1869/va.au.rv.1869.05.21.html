                    Constitution, which is scheduled now for a vote in July. Claims many expediency
                    men have seen the error of their ways and now support the idea of voting down

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Elsewhere will be found the proclamation of President Grant ordering an
                        election on Tuesday July 6th.</p>
                    <p>From this proclamation it will be seen that only the test oath and
                        disqualification clauses of the Constitution are to be submitted to a
                        separate vote. The county organization clause, far more objectionable in its
                        result to the people of the State than either of the above, is left to be
                        voted upon with the remainder of the Constitution. This will necessitate the
                        appointment of near 200 salaried officers in this county and a proportionate
                        number in other Counties. And such a set of officers! It will also entail a
                        burthen of about $100,000 in the shape of additional taxation to be borne by
                        the people of each county. Disregard, if you choose, the other objectionable
                        features remaining in the Constitution, and what man in Virginia, for the
                        sake merely of Reconstruction, could vote for saddling himself and posterity
                        with such a curse?</p>
                    <p>We have not expected the present Administration, judging from the past, to be
                        guided by a generous magnanimity, and to allow us an opportunity to modify
                        the proposed Constitution, so that it might be even bearable and we have not
                        been disappointed. Hence have we, on that account, as well as on account of
                        preserving, if we can, the very principles on which the existence and
                        permanency of Republican Government depends, counseled all to be led astray
                        by none of the supposed expediency movements of the past year. We have been
                        more than sustained in the line we have pursued, by the course political
                        events have taken and we again raise our voice to warn all to vote against
                        the clauses to be submitted separately and then vote against the remainder.
                        Vote against the whole Underwood Constitution. Safety to our people and
                        their posterity lies in this course alone.</p>
                    <p>We have been jeered as impracticable because we would not barter principles
                        for false hopes--because we would not sacrifice what we believe would alone
                        conduce to the present and future welfare of Virginia for the expurgated
                        Underwood Constitution and the anticipated beauties (?) of reconstruction
                        under it. We have nevertheless, stood firm and have the proud satisfaction
                        of knowing, that many, who jeered us, now acknowledge their error and stand
                        with us in support of the policy of voting down the whole Constitution.</p>
                    <p>To the very few papers in the State, who have battled continuously for
                        principle and for the defeat of the Underwood COnstitution entire, we say,
                        be of good cheer. Those who were led off by a cry of expediency are
                        re-enlisting under our banners by hundreds. Our compeers, blinded for a time
                        by the dust thrown in their eyes, are again, one by one, shouting our battle
                        cry. From this time till the election our old allies will join us by 
                        of each and every abomination of the Underwood abortion.</p>

                    <p>A gentleman who formerly resided in Alabama, now a resident of this County,
                        told me this morning, that in Alabama, wherever the negroes are in the
                        majority, the voters are permitted to vote for their County and municipal
                        officers, but where the whites are most numerous, those officers are
                        appointed by the Radical state officers.</p>
                    <p>The entire control of the community is thus in the hands of the negroes and
                        Radicals. Will the people of this Valley vote for the Underwood Constitution
                        in any form, either as it now stands or expurgated (as the phrase goes,)
                        after knowing how these new Constitutions are worked in the reconstructed
                        States? If they have any kindliness of feeling for their friends in Eastern

                        the dangers which are anticipated by its rejection.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>STAUNTON, May 10th, 1869.</p>
                    <p>
                        Fellow-Citizens of the County of Augusta:
                    </p>
                    <p>In obedience to the wishes of many friends residing in various portions of
                        the County, expressed both publicly and privately, I announce myself a
                        candidate for a seat in the next House of Delegates of Virginia.</p>
                    <p>If it should be the pleasure of the people to elect me to this position, I
                        shall, irrespective of party consideration, work and vote to obtain the
                        passage of such laws as will, in my judgment, secure the greatest amount of
                        peace, prosperity and happiness to the people at large.</p>
                    <p>In the approaching election, soon to be held, I shall most unhesitatingly
                        vote for the expurgated constitution and for what is known as the Walker
                        ticket; believing the adoption of this course by the people is the only door
                        of escape from the ultimate imposition upon them of an odious, tyrannical
                        and unbearable government. And although the result of this line of conduct,
                        in any event, is not as we would like to have it, yet I am firmly persuaded
                        that in our subjugated, helpless condition, the exigency of the hour, makes
                        it a high and patriotic duty to yield to the demands of inexorable
                        necessity, accept the situation, and reconstruct the State upon the basis of
                        the expurgated Constitution and the election of such men as are opposed to
                        disfranchisements and test oaths, and who are identified with us in interest
                        and sympathy.</p>
                    <p>This result, which is the best we can hope for, can certainly be achieved if
                        all will register and vote--Virginia, if her sons are true to her, can be
                        placed under the control of Virginians, and the miserable carpet bag scum
                        and vultures of the north, who have come down among us to array one race
                        against the other, in order that they may more easily prey upon the
                        substance and vitals of our helpless and prostrate people, can be sent back,
                        howling to their old haunts of vice and depravity.</p>
                    <p>These salutary results will only be attained, however as a distinguished
                        countryman said, in the late Convention, by united effort, induced by mutual
                        conciliation and forbearance one towards another.</p>
                    <p>Let us then obliterate from our minds all past political differences, leaving
                        the dead past to bury the dead, and unite in one great band of friends and
                        brothers, "among whom no contention shall exist, but that noble contention,
                        or rather emulation of who can best work and best agree" in saving Virginia
                        from degradation and ruin.</p>
                    <p>My devotion to Virginia has always been great, but since dark, heavy clouds
                        have lowered over her and broken with remorseless fury upon her devoted
                        head. I have drawn her close and closer to my heart, until her destiny and
                        mine have become inseparably locked up together, and should it be the will
                        of the people to make me an humble instrument to aid in restoring her to
                        peace and prosperity, I shall ever be grateful for the confidence reposed.</p>
                    <p>Respectfully,</p>
                    <p>ALEXANDER B. COCHRAN</p>
