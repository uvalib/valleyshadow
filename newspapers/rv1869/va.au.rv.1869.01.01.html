<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Praises the recent general amnesty issued by President Johnson. Hopes
                    Congress will take the same tact and remove all political restrictions from
                    disfranchised Southerners.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Elsewhere we publish the proclamation of the President declaring a full
                        pardon and amnesty, "unconditionally and without reservation, to each and
                        every one who, 'directly or indirectly," participated in the late
                        insurrection or rebellion, which he presented to the people as a Christmas
                        Gift.</p>
                    <p>This noble act of the President has been met by an almost universal
                        approbation of the press of the whole country. Even some of the most radical
                        papers of the North hail it as most wise and proper, and declare it to be in
                        accord with the general sentiment of the country, which is now in favor of
                        letting by-gones be by-gones and letting everybody in the South start
                        afresh, as the penalties inflicted, already, upon the Southern people have
                        been sufficiently great.</p>
                    <p>As to the effect of this proclamation there is quite a diversity of opinion.
                        All agree that it will stop all prosecutions against persons charged with
                        treason and prevent any further action against any who committed any act
                        hostile to the United States, during the late war.</p>
                    <p>Whether it will restore to political privileges those who were disfranchised
                        by the reconstruction acts is the question. Those acts were not intended to
                        destroy the Constitutional power of the President to proclaim a general
                        amnesty and pardon, but were enacted to suit the exigency of the times, as
                        Congress thought, and would seem to declare that Congress had a like power
                        to pardon.--Some contend, however, that Congress must remove the
                        disabilities of all politically disabled by the reconstruction acts. This is
                        likely to be the construction of Congress, but we have hopes that that body
                        will see the great good to be accomplished by a general amnesty and remove,
                        at one blow, the disabilities of all mentioned above. It would be a most
                        happy sequel to the act of the President and would tend greatly to the
                        speedy restoration of that peace and good will so essential to the
                        prosperity and well-being of the whole country.</p>
                    <p>Whether this be done or not, the President has signalized the close of his
                        administration by an act of clemency which will redound to his great praise
                        through all time to come.</p>

<b>Extension of the Stay Law</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The following is the general order extending the stay law, issued by Gen.
                        Stoneman:</p>
                    <p>HEADQUARTERS FIRST MILITARY DISTRICT, STATE OF VIRGINIA, Richmond, Va., Dec. 22, 1868.--In view of the pecuniary distress
                        and difficulties which must necessarily ensure throughout this military
                        district upon the termination of the stay law on the first of January next,
                        and in the absence of any Legislature or body competent to devise the
                        appropriate remedy, therefore, it is ordered:</p>
                    <p>1. That the stay of executions against personal property, so far only as the
                        same exists under laws now in force, and which by the provisions thereof
                        expires on the said first day of January, 1869, shall be and is hereby
                        extended until the first day of July, 1869, and, if on or before the said
                        last named day the debtor shall have paid all the interest then due and
                        owing thereon, such execution shall be further stayed until other orders
                        from these or superior headquarters.</p>
                    <p>2. If, during the existence of this order, any debtor shall be eloigning any
                        property, which, but for the existence of this order, would be liable to
                        said execution, or shall dispose, or attempt to dispose of the same, to the
                        prejudice of his creditor, it shall be lawful and right for such a creditor
                        to apply to any Circuit Court, or to any judge thereof in vacation, giving
                        reasonable notice of such application to the debtor, and said court or judge
                        thereof in vacation, upon the statement under oath of the parties, and such
                        legal evidence as they may adduce, may make an order to the clerk to issue
                        said execution for the entire debt, interest and cost, or else dismiss such
                        application with costs to either party, as to the said court or judge shall
                        seem right.</p>
                    <p>3. General orders No. 24, of March 12th, 1868, are hereby continued in force,
                        and the military commissioners and circuit judges intrusted with their
                        execution are enjoined to observe and give effect to the same.</p>
                    <p>4. It is intended by this order that whilst affording relief to the debtor
                        not to impair the rights of the creditor, but to preserve and enforce the
                        same by subjecting the whole personal estate which is now exempt by the stay
                        law to the lien of the creditor's execution, and at the same time enforce a
                        prompt payment of a part of the debt, and an early payment of the remainder.</p>
                    <p>By command of Brevet Major General Stoneman. S.F. Chalfin.</p>
                    <p>Assistant Adjutant General</p>
                    <p>THe following is General orders No. 24, of March 12th, 1868, referred to
                        above:</p>
                    <p>"HEADQUARTERS FIRST MILITARY DISTRICT, STATE OF VIRGINIA, Richmond Va., MARCH 12TH, 1868.--1. Sale of property under deeds
                        of trust, when every civil remedy has been exhausted, will be suspended by
                        the operation of this order in all cases where such sale would result in a
                        ruinous and unnecessary sacrifice of property, or where the payment of
                        interest when due, and of the principal in a reasonable time, can be secured
                        without such sacrifice; and also in cases where such sale would leave a
                        family of persons non compos or infirm, without
                        means of support.</p>
                    <p>"2. In any case coming within the above conditions the grantor may apply by
                        petition in writing in duplicate, under oath, to the military commissioner
                        or circuit judge having jurisdiction of the place in which the property
                        encumbered is located, setting forth a statement of all charges,
                        encumbrances or liens relating to the property, and the material facts
                        relied upon to support the petition. If the judge or commissioner be of
                        opinion that the facts set forth are sufficient to sustain the petition, he
                        will endorse such opinion on the duplicate petition, and cause one copy
                        thereof to be served upon the trustee; whereupon the trustee shall suspend
                        the sale, and it shall remain suspended until the said opinion of the judge
                        or commissioner shall be withdrawn, or the grantor shall give his consent in
                        writing to its discharge, or an order shall be made by the commanding
                        general authorizing the sale.</p>
                    <p>"3. If it be demanded by the trustees or beneficiaries or other parties in
                        interest, the judge or commissioner will hear all parties by evidence and
                        counsel, and upon the facts as proved at such hearing will affirm or
                        withdraw his previous opinion, or suggest to the parties such terms of
                        compromise as to to him shall seem equitable and just. But either
                        party may appeal from such final action of a judge or commissioner to the
                        commanding general, give notice of his appeal in writing to the judge or
                        commissioner, who will inform the other parties in interest, and in case of
                        appeal by the grantor or parties claiming under him, the sale shall remain
                        suspended until the decision of the commanding general is made known. All
                        such appeals shall be accompanied with a copy of the original petition,with
                        the opinion of the judge or commissioner endorsed thereon, and with a copy,
                        certified by the judge or commissioner, of the record of facts proved before
                        him.</p>
                    <p>"4. Reasonable expenses for clerical labor connected with the hearing may be
                        directed by the judge or commissioner, to be paid by either or both parties,
                        as shall seem to him just. In case of appeal, the expenses of such clerical
                        work connected with the appeal shall be paid or secured by the applicant.</p>
                    <p>"5. It is the purpose of the commanding general hereafter as heretofore, not
                        to interfere with the operation of the State laws as administered by the
                        civil tribunals, except where the remedies thereby afforded are inadequate
                        to secure to individuals substantial justice. It is expected that, in
                        general, cases of the class referred to in this order will be settled by
                        mutual concession and compromise between the parties, in accordance with the
                        principles herein set forth, and that the orders of the commanding general
                        will be required only in exceptional cases.</p>
                    <p>"By command of Brev. Maj. Gen. Schofield.</p>
                    <p>S.F. Chalfin,</p>
                    <p>Assistant Adjutant General</p>
