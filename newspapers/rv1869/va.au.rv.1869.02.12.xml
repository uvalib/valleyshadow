                    <p>"Pacificus," a correspondent of the Richmond <emph rend="italic">Whig</emph>,
                        who is a thorough new mover, suggests the propriety of the convention, which
                        is to assemble on the 17th of March to receive the report of the Committee
                        of nine, endorsing the nominees, of the Republican convention, which is to
                        meet on March 7th. This is the ultimate end of the new movement and
                        "Pacificus" clearly accepts it, and proposes to go over to the Republican
                        party at one step.</p>
                    <p>The Nottoway meeting not only endorsed the new movement but resolved itself
                        into a political organization with the name of the "Republican party." And
                        thus they go. It is "the first step that costs" says an old French proverb,
                        and, unless you want to land in the Republican party, beware of the first
                        step as a new mover. There is no halfway house. In the present political
                        phase, <emph rend="italic">conservatism</emph> has become obsolete. Choose
                        ye then between the new movement and those opposed thereto--or, in other
                        words, between the Democratic and Republican parties. Don't dodge the issue
                        but meet it squarely.</p>

                    "bourbons." Those in favor, the editors joke, should be called "chameleons" for
                    "the facility with which they change color. Not so bad, considering that a short
                    time back they were excessively white, but since they have mounted the 'top
                    rail' they have assumed a very dark hue."</summary>
