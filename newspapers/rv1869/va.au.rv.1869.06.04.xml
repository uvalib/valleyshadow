                    <p>The re-opening of the registration lists is ordered to take place on the 14th
                        instant. They will remain open, for revision, correction and additions, ten
                        days, Sunday excepted. A number of old precincts have been re-established
                        and hence it becomes necessary for every one to see that he is properly
                        registered at his voting precinct.--This is an imperative duty, whether the
                        party desires to vote or not. If he is not registered at his precinct he can
                        not vote, however much he may desire to do so.</p>
                    <p>Every man, who did not as an officer, previous to the adoption of the
                        ordinance of secession, take an oath to support the Constitution of the
                        United States no matter what he may have done during confederate times, is
                        entitled to register. All who did take that oath, and who did not by voting
                        for the ordinance of secession or such like act aid or assist the Southern
                        Confederacy are entitled to register.</p>
                    <p>Every man then who can register and who fails to do so is derelict in his
                        duty to his neighbors, himself and his posterity. Let him awaken from his
                        apathy ere it be too late. Let him come forward at the proper time and place
                        himself in a position to exercise the little of right left him. The day and
                        hour is speedily coming when he will repent of the folly of refusing to
                        register.--Registered, let him fail not to come forward on the day of
                        election and vote against the clauses submitted separately, and, <emph
                            rend="italic">by all means</emph>, vote against the remainder of the
                            Constitution--<emph rend="italic">vote the whole thing
                        down</emph>.--This is alike your own interest as well as that of the whole
                        State.</p>
                    <p>Be warned then and fail not, as you value the future of yourself and your
                        posterity, to see that you are properly registered as a voter, and that you
                        exercise that privilege on the day of election by <emph rend="italic">voting
                            down the whole Constitution</emph>. Much depends upon one and all, and
                        woe be to him who fails in this our darkest hour.</p>
