                    <p>The Boards of Registration are now in session at various points in the
                        County. They will continue in session until Thursday evening next.</p>
                    <p>Persons entitled to register must apply to the Board, in the Magisterial
                        District in which they reside. Any person previously registered <emph
                            rend="italic">in the State,</emph> who has changed his residence since,
                        can register in the district in which he now resides, by applying to the
                        board before whom he previously registered for a certificate of registration
                        and presenting this certificate to the board of the district in which he
                        resides. If he can not receive a certificate in time for registration, he
                        may vote on presentation of his certificate and making affidavit that he has
                        resided ten days in the district and has not previously voted at that
                        election. Or if he fails to receive a certificate he can vote by swearing in
                        addition that he was registered and giving the name of the county and
                        precinct in which he registered.</p>
                    <p>The Boards of Registration are supplied with blank certificates and
                        affidavits. Persons must have resided in the State one year to be entitled
                        to vote.</p>
                    <p> When the number of votes registered, in any magisterial District exceed 400,
                        separate polling places will be designated by the Board and the boundaries
                        of the precincts defined and notice thereof posted, and voters are required
                        to vote at the polling places of their separate precincts, but <emph
                            rend="italic">may</emph> vote at any place within their magisterial
                        District if it is shown to the commissioner of election that they failed to
                        get notice in time or for other good reason failed to vote in the precinct
                        and they have not previously voted at the election. </p>
                    <p>We are indebted to Lieut. Towns, Military Commissioner for the above date,
                        which we can give in a more concise form than heretofore for the information
                        of all and for easy reference Each and every person interested in the above
                        should take the proper steps to have his name properly registered. Each and
                        every one should not only see that he is himself properly registered, but
                        that his neighbors also are registered.</p>
                    <p>Those who have failed heretofore to register must fail no longer. The time is
                        short and emergency pressing. Let it be your first great duty to register
                        and to see that all, entitled to register, do so.</p>

                <summary>This article stresses the importance of both registering to vote as well as
                    making sure that all others register. To clarify the registration process, the
                    author has provided the various conditions that a voter must meet to be eligible
                    for the vote wherever he may live. Included are terms regarding length of
                    residency and affidavits and certificates concerning eligibility.</summary>

                    <p>On Friday last Gov. Wells and L.H. Chandler, Esq., addressed the people of
                        Augusta, in the Court House. The speakers were introduced by Maj. Jno. A.
                        Harman, who counseled against the clauses to be submitted separately and
                        then to vote for Gov. Wells, who he proclaimed was, excepting Gov. Billy
                        Smith, the "best abused" man that ever ran for office in Virginia.</p>
                    <p> Gov. Wells, then addressed the crowd which was made up largely of
                        Conservatives who desired to hear what, Gov. Wells had to say and who were
                        greatly surprised, that, expressing <emph rend="italic">his</emph>
                        determination to vote against the Test Oath and Disfranchisement clauses, he
                        failed to advise his party followers to do so. </p>
                    <p>L.H. Chandler, followed in a very ingenious argument in favor of Wells and
                        the expurgated Constitution. We only regretted that no one was present to
                        answer him in his advocacy of the Underwood abomination.</p>
                    <p>Jenkins, of Winchester, followed, and we learn, from his manner and style,
                        disgusted the Conservatives present, who left en masse.</p>

                <summary>This report of a group of speakers recently gathered at the Staunton
                    courthouse describes Governor Wells's determination to vote against the test
                    oath and disfranchisement clauses in the constitution. Others concur with his
                    sentiments. One exception, whose opinions apparently "disgusted" conservatives
                    in attendance, forced many to leave the meeting.</summary>

                        $101.90, which sum the Clerk was directed to charge to D. Taylor,
                        Superintendent water works, as against his salary for the current quarter.</p>
                    <p>A certificate of allowances made by the Hustings Court of the town was
                        presented, and the Council made an allowance to its Clerk, and an
                        appropriation for the support of the poor of the town; also an appropriation
                        to pay for articles ordered for the water works.</p>
                    <p>A petition was presented from R.W. Burke, praying for a renewal of the

                    <p>A report was presented from the Commissioner of Streets, recommending an
                        extension of New street to the Railroad, which, being considered, was
                        adopted--and, on motion, a sum not exceeding $200, was appropriated for that
                        purpose.</p>
                    <p>A communication was presented from P.B. Hoge, praying to be relieved from the
                        water tax on brickyards, which, on motion, was laid on the table.</p>
                    <p>A report was presented from John B. Evans, Committee, in relation to the
                        repairs of the tower of the Lutheran Church, recommending an appropriation

                        $50 was appropriated for that purpose.</p>
                    <p>On the petition of J.B. Scherer, Jr., Captain of the Augusta Fire Company, an
                        appropriation of $100 was made to said company.</p>
                    <p> An Ordinance was passed concerning auctioneers. The Council adjourned until
