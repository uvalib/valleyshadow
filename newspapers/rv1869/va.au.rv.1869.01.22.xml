                    <p>Every day for the past week we have been <unclear>misled</unclear> with
                        dispatches and communications <unclear>from</unclear> Washington, expressing
                        in glowing colors the progress of the committee of nine, who are engaged in
                        the work of attempting to secure from Congress universal amnesty in
                        consideration of a voluntary acceptance of universal suffrage, and its
                        concomitants of eligibility to office &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>We expressed our want of confidence in the new movement, several weeks since,
                        deeming it unwise and likely to result to the disadvantage of our people,
                        but, from the repeated assertions from Washington that it was gaining ground
                        with Radical members of Congress, and hoping that our fears might not be
                        realized, and that something of good might result to our oppressed people
                        from the labors of the Committee of nine, we refrained from saying any thing
                        further against it, than to admonish our people to be ready to defeat the
                        Underwood Constitution, which we believed would be an inevitable necessity.</p>
                    <p>The papers of Tuesday night, however, show the progress of the committee's
                        labors, in a way not calculated to impress one with the idea of great
                        results being accomplished. They bring the news of the passage of the
                        following joint resolution, by the Lower House of Congress, without a
                        division:</p>
                    <p>"That all persons holding office in Virginia and Texas, (except those whose
                        disabilities are removed,) who cannot take the test oath of July 2d 1862, be
                        removed within thirty days from the passage of the resolution, and that the
                        district commander fill their places with men who can take the oath."</p>
                    <p>This looks as if the committee of nine has been most egregiously imposed
                        upon, if former reports be true. Members of both Houses of Congress are
                        reported to have expressed great sympathy with the project of the committee,
                        so much as to lead them to suppose that a Constitution, freed from such
                        objectionable features as test-oaths, disfranchisements &amp;c, would
                        meet with the almost universal favor of Congress. That a bill would be
                        passed relieving the disabilities of the 14th Amendment at a blow,
                        &amp;c., &amp;c. On the heels of this, in fact in the same paper
                        containing such gratifying news to many, comes the news of the passage of
                        the above resolution. Evidently the <emph rend="italic">sympathizing</emph>
                        members of Congress have either misled the committee or else have most
                        suddenly and in a remarkable manner changed their convictions. We are
                        inclined to believe the former and consider it but retributive justice for
                        the attempt to "sell our birth-right for a mess of pottage."</p>
                    <p>If the committee, by their efforts, place the condition of the Southern
                        people in a fairer light before the people of the North, as some suppose,
                        they will have accomplished fully as much as we believed. Of this we are
                        doubtful now. The fear that the project of the committee, if successful,
                        would result in the overthrow of the Radical party in the South, in our
                        opinion, has precipitated the resolution we copy above, and we may be
                        thankful if no harsher legislation be the result. It were far better that we
                        had stuck to principle. We were fast winning the admiration of the Northern
                        people for consistency, while carpet-bag representatives were fast playing
                        out. A little more nerve and all would have come out right. A few however,
                        and we may add a very few, (for nine out of every ten we know oppose the new
                        movement,) thought differently and acted otherwise. The results, we fear,
                        will make us regret, for a long time to come, that even those few had not
                        remained true to their past sentiments, which were the sentiments of the
                        many, and found their expression in one of the most harmonious conventions
                        ever assembled in the State, the Conservative Convention of December
                        1867.--The Hon. A. H. H. Stuart was called to the chair, and in a most
                        appropriate speech, which was loudly cheered, expressed the sentiments of
                        that body, which are the sentiments of nine-tenths of the people of Virginia
                        at this time and, from which, for their conciseness and volume of
                        expression, as well as being the embodiment of our sentiments to-day, we
                        copy the following extracts:</p>
                    <p>"That a policy is to be inaugurated here which tends, if it be not designed,
                        to subvert our whole social fabric and to bring the land of Washington,
                        Henry, Jefferson, Madison, and Marshall, under the dominion of an alien and
                        inferior race. We should be false to all the instincts of humanity--false to
                        the blood which courses through our veins--false to every obligation of duty
                        to ourselves, our kindred, and our country, if we did not earnestly protest
                        against and seek to arrest so fearful a calamity.</p>
                    <p>"We prefer military rule to the despotism of an ignorant rabble. And we wish
                        to declare with earnestness and emphasis, that, come what may, we and those
                        we represent, can never agree that this shall be any other than a White
                        Man's Government. Our rights may be wrested from us by violence, but we will
                        never agree that our proud old mother shall be presented in the attitude of
                        consenting to her own degradation."</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>From our exchanges we learn that one Chas. King, D. D., <emph rend="italic">a
                            resident of Staunton Va.,</emph> has written a remonstrance against the
                        removal of the political disabilities of "rebel" officers which was
                        presented to the Senate on Saturday last. He says:</p>
                    <p>"The rumor of it creates a panic among Union men. If you relieve these rebel
                        judges we are politically ruined. For God's sake, interpose and prevent
                        this. It is false to say that we have not Union men to fill the principal
                        offices, and if not, let them remain vacant until they can be filled with
                        good men from the loyal States. Save us from the tender mercies of wicked,
                        persecuting rebels. The restrictive measures in the reconstruction acts and
                        the fourteenth amendment, and in our proposed constitution, are our only
                        hope. If you will hold the rebels in check until we can adopt the new
                        constitution <emph rend="italic">then</emph> perhaps, as they bring forth
                        fruits meet for repentance, they may gradually and individually be relieved
                        from the curse of a broken and violated law, but for the present we are
                        unwilling to make a curse for them."</p>
                    <p>This remonstrance was written by a man who is not in the least identified in
                        interest with the people of Virginia, being only temporarily assigned by the
                        Baltimore Conference of the M.E. Church, to the Augusta circuit.</p>
                    <p>We had given him credit for a christian spirit and candor, but with all
                        deference to the ministerial calling, we must assert that he starts out with
                        a positive untruth. So far from "creating a panic among Union men," we doubt
                        if there be any Union man in the county who will agree with this <emph
                            rend="italic">political</emph> Divine. Those we have talked with and
                        heard from deprecate this <emph rend="italic">political</emph> act of a man
                        claiming to be a minister and think he had better confine himself to his
                        calling, and attend to the spiritual--not the political <sic>wellfare</sic>
                        of mankind. We think, however, that if his spiritual teachings are no better
                        than his political he had better abandon both.</p>
                    <p>There has been no complaint to our knowledge, of injustice, at the hands of
                        our judges to Union men. Since that is the case, how relieving our Judges
                        would damage Union men, we can't understand. Especially how it would <emph
                            rend="italic">"politically ruin"</emph> them we are totally at a loss to
                        conceive. Perhaps this political Divine may be able to tell the connection
                        between Justice and Politics, but a sad experience for several years past
                        has led us to believe there is not the slightest connection between them.</p>
                    <p>He exposes the cat in the meal tub in the desire to have carpet-bag gentry
                        from the "loyal" States fostered upon us. Congress has had enough of
                        carpet-baggers to satisfy any body of men, and we think we appeal not in
                        vain when we say "for God's sake, interpose and prevent this." Especially
                        would we make this appeal if we thought this proscriptive Divine was likely
                        to step into office.</p>
                    <p>Union men and secessionists are getting along quietly and peaceably and we
                        protest against all attempts like that of Chas. King to stir up strife and
                        especially at the expense of truth, which we asserted marked the beginning
                        of his remonstrance and from our knowledge of the man in our opinion,
                        characterizes its conclusion, in that of falsely assuming, as we believe,
                        the title of D. D.</p>

                    <p>When the Valley Railroad is built it will give what the producers of this
                        Valley have so long needed, a cheap, because a competing route, to competing
                        markets for their produce. We now pay <emph rend="italic">more than
                        double</emph> what other people pay, who have competing routes to market. If
                        the Central Railroad charged the same rate as the Baltimore and Ohio now
                        charges, our flour would go to Richmond from Staunton for 25 cents a barrel,
                        instead of 60 cents, <emph rend="italic">saving to the farmer</emph>, on
                        each barrel, 35 cts and thus he would save on ten barrels of flour $3.50.
                        Now the railroad tax on that amount of property, say $100 would be about 20
                        cts. So the farmer with 10 barrels of flour for market could afford to pay
                        the railroad tax and then have $3.30 left clear gain over his present <emph
                            rend="italic">"tax"</emph> (at 60 cents a barrel,) of $6.00. More than
                        that; if he lived near Mt. Sidney, say, where he could load his ten barrels
                        immediately on the railroad, he would get it to Staunton for 15 cents,
                        instead of about $2.50, at the present wagon rates of 25 cents per barrel.
                        Thus with the Valley R. R. to Staunton, and the competition from there on
                        the Central Railroad, the farmer near Mt. Sidney would send every ten
                        barrels of flour to market at a cost of $2.65, instead of the present cost
                        of $8.50, and his subscription tax on that ten barrels would be only about
                        20 cents, paid out to save him $8.30. Let this calculation be applied to
                        every thing else sent to market, and to every thing purchased for supplies
                        from abroad, and the tax would be made up a hundred fold every year.</p>
                    <p>Our farmers ARE NOW HEAVILY TAXED annually <emph rend="italic">for want of
                            this road</emph>. The Ohio farmer at Cincinnati, sends a barrel of flour
                        to Baltimore, over 600 miles, for less than the Augusta farmer pays on it to
                        Baltimore, only 194 miles. The Ohio farmer who loads his flour at Wheeling
                        for Baltimore 380 miles, pays only 2 cts more than the Augusta farmer now
                        pays from Craigsville to Richmond 156 miles. Now is the chance to get rid of
                        this oppressive taxation by securing a rival route to market, and if Augusta
                        now fails to vote this subscription the chance is gone for years, if not for
                        this generation. Baltimore can do without spending the $6,000,000 required
                        to build this road but Augusta farmers cannot afford to lose it for the
                        paltry tax on each one to raise $300,000.</p>

                    Cites distances and prices of other places to show how farmers pay so much more
                    without a railroad than those who have access to one.</summary>

                <summary>The County Court ordered a second election on the Valley Railroad question
                    to be held February 6th. Small turnout, voter irregularities, and bad weather
                    necessitated a re-vote. Prominent citizens will speak throughout Augusta in
                    favor of the subscription of stock by the county.</summary>
