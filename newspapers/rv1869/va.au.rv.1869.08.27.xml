                    <p>The colored man receives another blow in the house of his friends. The
                        Washington <emph rend="italic">Republican</emph> would rob him of the
                        privilege of voting, which it was instrumental in having granted to him, by
                        a 16th amendment. The Richmond <emph rend="italic">Journal</emph> (Wells
                        Republican,) would deprive him of the privilege in a less bold manner. It
                        would not allow him to vote unless he had paid his taxes. That it is the
                        colored man the <emph rend="italic">Journal</emph> is after is evident,
                        although it suggests the payment of taxes by <unclear>all</unclear>
                        suffragans be made the price of a ballot. </p>
                    <p>The list of delinquents in the State is enormously large and nine out of ten
                        delinquents are colored men. This is a notorious fact. Then for every white
                        refused a vote for non-payment of taxes nine blacks will be refused the
                        privilege also.</p>
                    <p> The theory of the <emph rend="italic">Journal,</emph> whether in the manner
                        he proposes or some other, we think is likely to become popular. </p>
                    <p> The opinion has long obtained with some that <del/> could be allowed a voice
                        in governing <del/> who give a pecuniary support to the government. Their
                        numbers, when the question is once agitated, will be largely increased, and
                        we should not be surprised to see a receipt for taxes the "open sesame" to
                        the ballot box. Colored men will be most largely disfranchised and they can
                        truly ascribe it to their <emph rend="italic">pretended</emph> friends, the
                        Radicals, who <del/> they are no longer pliable to their beck and nod, would
                        rob them of all they have granted under the plea of <emph rend="italic"
                            >rights.</emph></p>
                    <p>If a Democratic paper had suggested the abridgment of the privileges of the
                        former pets of Radicalism, the cry of disloyalty would be echoed and
                        re-echoed throughout the land. What should the same thing be called when
                        advanced by a Radical Journal?</p>

                <summary>This article attempts to illustrate how radicals have turned their backs on
                    their former "pets." Radicals have essentially disfranchised black voters by
                    enforcing a tax requirement at the polls. The author points out the hypocrisy of
                    the radicals who would generally accuse Democratic papers suggesting the same
                    thing of "disloyalty."</summary>

                    <p>Our people were startled, about midnight Saturday night last, by the
                        announcement that Jacob Scherer, third son of Jno. B. Scherer, Sr., had been
                        killed by Mr. John Stanley.</p>
                    <p>Jacob Scherer was a young, unmarried man, about twenty years of age, full of
                        fun, sociable, of an amiable disposition, which caused all our people to
                        esteem him highly, and it may well be imagined, that the announcement that
                        he had been cut down, in the vigor of life, caused a thrill of pain in the
                        very breast of every one.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stanley is a man of middle age, with a wife and one child, a son, about
                        15 or 16 years old, and was regarded as a steady, quiet, well-meaning man.</p>
                    <p>The circumstances attending the killing are as follows:</p>
                    <p>A party of some eight or ten young men, learning that Mr. Stanley was
                        co-habiting with a mulatto girl, named Ginnie Sorrel, blacked their faces
                        and went to her house, on Market Street, Saturday night last, for the
                        purpose of breaking up the illicit connexion. Several entered the house and
                        immediately a pistol was fired, killing Jacob Scherer, almost instantly.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stanley was identified by several of the party present, as the one who
                        fired the shot, and was arrested, at his house, about two hours after and
                        lodged in jail.</p>
                    <p>The examination of the case was entered into before Justices Pearce,
                        Clinedinst and Anderson, on Tuesday morning last. We give below a synopsis
                        of the testimony of the witnesses examined.</p>
                    <p> Dr B.B. Donaghe.--Called to see deceased about an hour after death. Found
                        him lying in the alley. Made no examination there, but at his father's.
                        Extracted the ball. The ball entered the left side between the 5th and 6th
                        ribs, and passed through the left lung, heart, and lodged in the right lung,
                        causing death almost instantly. Made a <emph rend="italic">post
                        mortem</emph> examination about 5 A.M. Dr. Fauntleroy assisted me. Cause of
                        death--wound. </p>
                    <p>Jas. O'Brian.--Saturday night went to house occupied by Ginnie Sorrel, and
                        waited till deceased came up. Knocked on the door, which was opened. Walked
                        in, made some remark, not remembered. Walked around the room to a door on
                        the left side leading to another room. Could not get in. Jacob Scherer
                        pushed against the door and it opened. Heard the voice of a woman
                        hallooing--saw the flash of a pistol--recognized Stanley. Stepped back out
                        of the door. Stanley came out by me. Scherer followed him a short distance
                        and fell. As he was falling Stanley pointed his pistol at him again. Went to
                        the place where Scherer fell. He was still living, but died in about three
                        minutes after he was shot.</p>
                    <p>Cross-Examined.--Was just inside the door.--As soon as I saw the flash
                        Stanley stepped out of the room. Saw Stanley again in the lot. He was under
                        my observation a short time. Was about three steps from him. Saw him in the
                        dark first. Am certain I recognized Stanley on both occasions, in the room
                        and in the alley. White was in the room. Stanley was to the left of me.--Saw
                        a pistol in Stanley's hand. It was pointed directly towards Scherer. Saw no
                        other persons in the room. Heard the woman screaming.--Can't say that I saw
                        any article of furniture. I just stepped in the door. Stanley was almost to
                        my front when I came in. Door is on the east side of the room. Think Scherer
                        was stooping.--Scherer and Stanley were not face to face. I stepped backward
                        out of the door after the pistol shot. Did not see the pistol as Stanley
                        passed out, but did in the lot. Stanley was about 15 steps from the door
                        when he pointed the pistol second time. Scherer was 6 or 8 steps from
                        Stanley when he fell. Pistol was pointed at Scherer when he fell. Stanley
                        then ran in north-easterly direction. Saw him get over the stone-wall into
                        the street near Mr. Jos Ryan's. Have known Stanley since the surrender. Went
                        with the party by previous agreement. Jno. B. Scherer, Jr. asked me if I did
                        not want a little fun. He said Mr. Stanley was staying there and wanted to
                        take Stanley and the woman and duck them. Jas Trayer is the only one who
                        went with me from Beard's. Knew the others were going--some 6 or 8.
                        Determined to duck the woman, but not determined as to Stanley. A plan was
                        laid. We went to the back door by orders. Beard laid the plan. Scherer told
                        me to go to the back door. I waited outside till I saw the others. Don't
                        know if any were at the front door. Knocked at the lower door--the upper
                        door was open. No response. There was nothing said. Heard nothing from the
                        inside. The door was opened from the inside I believe. Heard talking at the
                        other door. Think by a colored man. Went in that door. Found Jacob Scherer
                        and Trayer in the other room. Went in another room or passage alone. Could
                        see the front door open--Could see into the street. There was a negro woman
                        and child in the room I first went in--child on the floor and the woman
                        walking about. Don't know how the door of other room was opened by Scherer
                        or some one inside. Saw him push the door with his hand. Don't know whether
                        he took one hand or both hands. Couldn't say that he broke it open. Could
                        not tell anything in the room but for the flash of the pistol. Distinguished
                        Scherer from White during pistol flash by their form and clothes. The man
                        that passed me was running. It was Stanley. Made two or three steps when
                        Scherer followed. Saw no woman in the room. Saw a colored man outside. There
                        was no loud talking. Did not say who we were or what we wanted. Party
                        consisted of 8 or 9 and faces blackened. Were not fully determined to do
                        anything with Stanley. Don't know if Stanley could have recognized any one.
                        Might have recognized a man coming in the door. Knew White by light and
                        Scherer by dark clothes.--Don't think you could see a man but for the flash
                        of pistol. Stanley was nearer the door than Scherer. Scherer was only two
                        feet from the muzzle of the pistol. They were nearer the door than the
                        opposite wall. The woman to be ducked was Ginnie Sorrel. Had not been a word
                        spoken by Scherer. Saw Stanley point the pistol at Scherer in the yard and
                        knew Scherer in the yard. His face was blackened.</p>
                    <p>N. S. White.--Saw Scherer shot. Don't know whose house it is, nor who lives
                        there. Went through the house. Scherer stepped in the door. Heard a woman
                        cry murder. Saw her in her night clothes. Thought I saw the form of a man
                        stooping when the shot was fired. Went in front and out back door. Door was
                        open. Saw Scherer go in the door next Hardy's shop and followed close after
                        him. Saw the woman before I got in. Neither saw nor heard any thing in room.
                        Was in about one or one and a half minutes when the shot was fired and I
                        went out. Noticed nothing but the man who shot. Stanley shot. He was close
                        to me, and his pistol was opposite my face. I went out immediately after the
                        shot. Stanley went out first and Scherer next. Saw both after I got out.
                        Stanley was running. He turned around once. There was moonshine and I am
                        certain it was Stanley. I was following Scherer when Stanley turned and I
                        stopped. No pursuit was made Scherer fell before I got to him. He had a
                        black coat on. Pistol was on right side of my face. Scherer stood to my
                        right, was bending and had his face turned from Stanley, with but a short
                        distance between them. No difficulty in Stanley's getting to the door.
                        Scherer did not seem in search of Stanley. There was nothing said by either.
                        Stanley left first.</p>
                    <p>Cross-Examination.--It was between 11 and 12 o'clock. Front door was open
                        from inside. Saw a woman in first room. Scherer went into the room. I heard
                        a woman cry murder. Don't know dimensions of room. Did not recognize any
                        one's face but could distinguish the form of a man. Heard no struggle.
                        Scherer did not hold any one. Don't know what he was doing. Nothing said.
                        Didn't know any body but our party was in the room, until I saw the flash of
                        pistol. Was blackened. Saw Stanley stop in running with the pistol in his
                        hand. Was with Charles Trayer. Didn't hear any body speak. No one spoke to
                        me and nothing was said as to what we were doing. The room in which Scherer
                        was shot was very dark. Did not wish to be known. Saw no weapons in the
                        hands of any of our party. Don't know what I went into the room for. Went to
                        see what Scherer was doing. Went to see what was the matter. Had no special
                        object in view.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Fauntleroy.--Was at the <emph rend="italic">post mortem</emph>
                        examination. Saw the body at Scherer's house. Examination was made between 5
                        and 6 o'clock in the morning. Deceased was shot in left side, posterior
                        portion of thorax, fracturing fifth rib, tore left lung, left cavity of
                        heart, passed through and ball was found imbedded near the surface of right
                        lung. Examined enough of abdomen to see that it was healthy. Direction of
                        ball was upward and outwards. Entered lower lobe of left and was found in
                        middle of right lung.--Wound was posterior to the nipple, below the arm-pit.
                        External wound did not correspond with internal, showing that the body was
                        bent forward. Ball and portion of left rib shown.</p>
                    <p>J. T. Parent.--Arrested Stanley. Found pistol in his possession. Took it
                        until after inquest. One barrel was discharged, the others loaded. The
                        hammer stood on the discharged barrel. Dont know when discharged. Made no
                        examination.</p>
                    <p>Henry Hyer.--Saw this pistol in Stanley's possession. He asked me how to load
                        it. Think the ball shown will fit the barrel.</p>
                    <p>Robt. Campbell.--Look exactly like my pistol. Stanley got a pistol from me
                        about two weeks ago. Said he wanted to buy it, but have not seen him since
                        on that subject.</p>
                    <p>Jas. Hess.--The pistol looks like Robt. Campbell's pistol, which he loaned me
                        at one time--Had it about a month and returned it about two weeks ago. It
                        was loaded then. It takes a long ball.</p>
                    <p>Geo. Harlan--Examined the premises. The catch was off the door of room in
                        which shooting took place. Couldn't find the catch and the woman said she
                        had been looking for but could not find it. Couldn't tell how long it had
                        been off.</p>
                    <p>A discussion took place as to the calling of a witness and then the court
                        adjourned until 5 P. M.</p>
                    <p>At 5 P. M. the court re-convened, and Col. M. G. Harman was introduced by the
                        defence to prove that John Stanley rented the house in which the shooting
                        took place.</p>
                    <p>The mother of Ginnie Sorrel, who occupies one portion of the house, was also
                        introduced, but her evidence was of no great moment.</p>
                    <p>The commonwealth introduced a witness to allow that Ginnie Sorrel kept a
                        house of ill-fame. The defence objected to its admissibility and, after
                        discussion, it was ruled out.</p>
                    <p>The court then adjourned till 8 A. M. Wednesday morning, at which time the
                        counsel in the case entered into a lengthy discussion on the question of
                        acquitting the prisoner or sending him to answer an indictment for homicide.</p>
                    <p>The court then rendered its decision, and committed John M. Stanley to jail,
                        to answer an indictment for homicide.</p>

                <summary>The paper prints an account of the killing of Jacob Scherer by John
                    Stanley. Stanley had been co-habiting with a woman of mixed race. Scherer led a
                    party to break up the union. They broke into the house and Stanley shot Scherer
                    in the process. Stanley was arrested for murder. The article includes a
                    transcript of the testimony before the grand-jury.</summary>

                    sincere friend. His hospitable door was open to all, and the poor never cried to
