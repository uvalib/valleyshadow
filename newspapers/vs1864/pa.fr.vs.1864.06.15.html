<b>The Baltimore Convention</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports on the Republican Convention in Baltimore that renominated Lincoln
                    for President.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The convention of office-holders, contractors and shoddyites, which met at
                        Baltimore on Tuesday the 7th inst., renominated "A. Lincoln" for President
                        and Andrew Johnson, of Tennessee, for Vice President. As the convention was
                        packed by Mr. Lincoln and his friends, and its work cut out for it at
                        Washington, the delegates had nothing to do but to record the wishes of
                        their Master, and adjourn. The only trouble about it seemed to be who should
                        have the honor of moving the nomination of his Highness, "Old Abe." Some
                        half dozen contestants entered the ring, among whom was the famous Winnebago
                        chief from Pennsylvania, General Cameron, who was most shamefully euchred
                        out of the glittering prize. After a great deal of excitement and confusion,
                        the honor (?) was finally divided between Mr.
                        Delano, of Ohio and Mr. Raymond, of New York, and the convention proceeded
                        to a vote which resulted, as a matter of course, in the unanimous
                        re-nomination of Abraham Lincoln.</p>
                    <p>The platform adopted consists of a series of eleven resolutions, which are in
                        effect as follows:</p>
                    <p>The first demands the suppression of the rebellion.</p>
                    <p>The second declares no compromise possible except upon unconditional
                        surrender of the rebels.</p>
                    <p>The third declares that slavery must be utterly extirpated, and demands an
                        amendment to the Constitution for that purpose.</p>
                    <p>The fourth thanks our soldiers and sailors for their services.</p>
                    <p>The fifth approves of Mr. Lincoln, the Emancipation proclamation, and the
                        negro soldiers.</p>
                    <p>The sixth advises the administration to be harmonious.</p>
                    <p>The seventh demands protection to soldiers without distinction of color.</p>
                    <p>The eighth favors foreign immigration.</p>
                    <p>The ninth favors a Pacific railroad.</p>
                    <p>The tenth promises the repayment of the national debt, and favors proper
                        taxation.</p>
                    <p>The eleventh declares that the Monroe doctrine shall be maintained.</p>
                    <p>After passing the usual resolutions of thanks to the officers, and to the
                        Mayor and city Council of Baltimore, the Convention adjourned on Wednesday
                        evening, many of the delegates leaving the same night yet for Washington to
                        receive their reward from the man whom they had served so well.</p>
                    <p>The re-nomination of Lincoln in the present exigencies of the country is an
                        insult to the intelligence of the American people. He has proven himself
                        totally unfit for the position he holds. He is weak, incapable, vacillating,
                        a time-server, without either wise comprehension of the present or sagacious
                        forecast of the future. Through his mismanagement and imbecility during
                        three years of bloody civil war, the resources of the country have been
                        wasted, thousands of lives have been uselessly sacrificed and millions of
                        treasure squandered, leaving the prospect of peace and a restored Union, as
                        far as human for[e]sight can go, as distant now as at the beginning. He has
                        lent himself to the schemes of the bold bad men around him, in whose hands
                        he is a mere tool to carry out their wicked designs. He has prostituted the
                        war from the high and noble object for which it was commenced to the basest
                        and most ignoble partisan purposes. By his selfishness and partisan policy,
                        he has chilled the ardor and enthusiasm of the people which at the first so
                        nobly responded to the calls of patriotism, and in consequence is now
                        compelled to fill the decimated ranks of the army by means of a merciless
                        conscription. He has trampled upon the Constitution which he was sworn to
                        "preserve, protect and defend." He has violated the personal liberty of the
                        citizen by his arbitrary arrests and unwarranted and unlawful searches and
                        seizures. He has attempted to stifle the voice of an antagonistic public
                        sentiment by the suppression of free speech and a free press. He has
                        suspended the privileges of the write of habeas
                        corpus, and denied to citizens the right of trial by jury. He has
                        arrested citizens without warrant or process of law, tried them for
                        pretended offences before military commissioners, and inflicted punishments
                        upon them unknown to our Constitution and Laws. In short, in the language of
                        General Fremont, "the ordinary rights secured under the
                            Constitution and the laws of the country have been violated, and
                            extraordinary powers have been usurped by the Executive."</p>
                    <p>Such is the public record of the man who is a second time presented to the
                        American people for their suffrages for the first office in their gift.
                        Unless the spirit of '76 is totally extinct in the hearts of a majority of
                        the people, he will be most ingloriously defeated.</p>

                    <p>This regiment for a long time doing garrison duty in the fortifications of
                        Washington, went to the front a short time since and has already made its
                        debut in battle. All accounts agree that it acted with undaunted courage and
                        coolness under fire. It will be recollected that a large number of the men
                        composing the regiment were recruited in this country by Lieut. B. F.
                        Winger, and it is gratifying to the friends of the brave fellows here, to
                        know that they have fought bravely as become Franklin County boys. We learn
                        that the loss of the regiment in battle was very great, but have been unable
                        to ascertain the name of the sufferers excepting the following officers
                        wounded: Maj. Anderson; Capt. Jones, Co. L., mortally; Capt. Strawbridge,

<b>Price of Beef</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Says that the Repository was wrong to criticize the town butchers for
                    raising the price of beef.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The last issue of the Repository contained an
                        unjust attack on the butchers of town for raising the price of beef. Beef is
                        high, but it is not higher in proportion than all other necessaries of life,
                        and we can see no good reason why the butchers should be singled out and
                        made special object of attack. Beef cattle have gone up enormously in price,
                        as the writer in the Repository ought to know.
                        Butchers now are compelled to pay from $6 to 7 per hundred, live weight, for
                        cattle, when they used to buy them at $2.50. How then can any reasonable man
                        expect them to retail their meat at old prices.</p>
                    <p>With the same propriety we might assail our Dry Goods Merchants for charging
                        40 cents per yard for Muslin that was formerly sold at 10; or our Grocers
                        for selling Coffee at 50 cents per pound that we used to buy at 12 1/2. We
                        dislike these high prices as much as any one, but we cannot see the justice
                        in selecting a particular class of our business men and holding them up to
                        the public gaze as extortioners, when they are doing no more than their
                        neighbors around them.</p>

                    <p>Mr. William D. Kelley is indignant. He does not care much whether the Federal
                        taxes are so imposed that Massachusetts gets off nearly scot free, whilst
                        Pennsylvania pays twice as much as she ought; but when it becomes a question
                        of who "drew the first blood," a negro or a Yankee, all his passion are
                        aroused. He really cannot permit his favorite to be deprived of this great
                        honor. When the future historian inquires of his muse who was the
                        protomartyr in "the crusade for liberty," Kelley insists that she shall
                        answer that he was black. He is proud of his State, and this is the way he
                        defends her:</p>
                    <p>Mr. Kelley, of Pennsylvania, wished it to be understood that the 18th came
                        before the 19th of April, and it was the blood of a colored man from Pennsylvania that was first shed in this war.</p>
                    <p>He is determined that all the glory shall not be monopolized by
                        Massachusetts, and this is the share he demands for Pennsylvania. No matter
                        that her soil has been invaded, her farms wasted, her granaries robbed,
                        whilst Massachusetts laughed at a safe distance; no matter that hundreds of
                        her children have been disgraced, deposed, dishonored, or refused
                        opportunity for distinguishment; no matter that McClellan is maligned[,]
                        Fitz John Porter degraded, Franklin placed in a subordinate command,
                        Patterson vituperated, Negley and Andrew Porter dropped; no matter that a
                        Governor has been snubbed and a Commonwealth derided; her's [sic] is the
                        great, everlasting glory of producing a negro who was killed on a day
                        preceding the 19th of April. Surely this ought to suffice any Pennsylvanian,
                        however greedy of distinction for his State he may be.--Age.</p>
