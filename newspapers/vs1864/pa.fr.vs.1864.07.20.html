</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The universal failure of the people to respond to the late call for troops is
                        the strongest proof yet developed to show how heartily sick and tired they
                        are of this war. The most urgent appeals and entreaties of a whining
                        Governor proved ineffectual to arouse their dormant enthusiasm. The border
                        was invaded and the capital of the nation was threatened, yet the people
                        manifested the most stolid indifference. And this indifference was not
                        confined to any particular class or party, but was seen among all classes
                        and all parties. The blatant "Loyal Leaguer" seemed as loth to shoulder a
                        musket as his "Copperhead" neighbor. Indeed, when Col. Thomas, of
                        Philadelphia, issued a card making a personal appeal to the "Leaguers" to
                        enlist, they regarded it as an insult to their dignity, and the Press and North
                        American, the organs of the League, refused to publish the card in
                        their columns. What right had Col. Thomas to ask "Leaguers" to enlist? He
                        should have known better. It is true, they howl themselves hoarse in favor
                        of war in their League Houses, but then they want others to do the fighting. Patriotic Leaguers!</p>
                    <p>But to return. Why is it that this apathy and indifference exists? The people
                        have lost all confidence in a successful termination of
                            the war. They regard the country as hopelessly ruined through the
                        mismanagement, imbecility and fanaticism of this administration. They have
                        seen the resources of the country wasted and hundreds of thousands of the
                        precious lives of their countrymen sacrificed in, what must now appear plain
                        to all, a vain effort to subjugate the Southern
                        people. They have seen the object of the war subverted from a high and holy
                        purpose to a mere crusade against African slavery. They are beginning to
                        realize the fact that under the present relentless and vindictive policy the
                        war must be interminable; or at least that it can never end except through
                        sheer exhaustion of both sections, when nothing but poverty, desolation,
                        ruin and anarchy will be left as the inheritance of a once proud, prosperous
                        and happy people.</p>
                    <p>In view of these facts is it any wonder that the people are growing weary,
                        very weary, of this bloody, ghastly, inhuman war? Is it any wonder that a
                        feeling of despondency rests upon the country when the word of promise has
                        so frequently been kept to the ear only to be broken to the hope?</p>

<b>"A. Lincoln"</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Explains how Lincoln has managed to lose the faith of the people beginning
                    from his first day in Washington.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>When the great buffoon who glories in the signature of "A. Lincoln" left his
                        accluded home in Sangamon county, Illinois, for Washington, in the spring of
                        1861, the country was agitated and rent with civil feuds from center to
                        circumference. Civil war was imminent and the minds of patriotic men in both
                        sections of the country were filled with the gravest apprehensions for the
                        fate of the Republic. They naturally looked to the man who, in an evil hour,
                        had been elected to the highest position in the nation, for words of hope
                        and encouragement; but they looked in vain. On his way to the National
                        Capital he regaled the people who assembled to greet him at the various
                        stopping places along the route--not with sound statesman-like views of
                        public policy--but with stale jokes which he had picked up in bar-rooms and
                        places of amusement and by telling them that there was "nothing going wrong"
                        and there was "nobody hurt!" The whole country was shocked at such levity
                        from a man occupying so high a position in a time of such fearful peril.
                        Sober and reflecting men of all parties then formed the opinion, from which
                        they have since had no reason to depart, that either the imbecility of his
                        mind was such as to render him incapable of comprehending the crisis, or
                        else that he was wickedly and premeditatedly bent on accomplishing the ruin
                        of his country. From a feeling of charity we are inclined to give him the
                        benefit of the former conclusion. Such was the foretaste of the people of
                        the United States had of Abraham Lincoln. His conduct since he assumed the
                        reins of government has not been calculated to elevate his character in the
                        public estimation. Blunder upon blunder has marked the whole course of his
                        administration. His foolish intermeddling with the movements of our armies
                        has been fruitful of the most serious disasters, and his mistaken civil
                        policy has needlessly prolonged the war and increased the public debt to so
                        great an extent as to make it a burden almost too great to be borne. A
                        third-rate back-woods lawyer, without any knowledge of military science,
                        assumes command of the army, undertaken to direct its movements, sets up his
                        opinion against the judgment of educated and distinguished officers of the
                        army and then triumphantly asks: "Wherein is your plan better than my plan?"
                        The feasibility of "my plan" has been repeatedly and sorrowfully tested
                        during the past two years at the cost, in the aggregate, of at least two
                        hundred thousand men and one thousand million dollars. Rather a costly
                        experiment!</p>
                    <p>The truth is Mr. Lincoln's administration has proved a miserable failure.
                        Every military operation which was peculiarly his own was an abortion. His
                        Emancipation Proclamation, to use his own expressive language, proved "a
                        Pope's bull against the comet." The currency of the country depreciated to
                        thirty cents on the dollar under the operation of the "grand financial
                        scheme" of late Secretary of the Treasury. In short his administration has
                        cost the nation one million men and three thousand million dollars, leaving
                        the country in a tenfold worse condition than it was on the day he assumed
                        the chair of State; and it is fair to presume that four years more of the
                        imbecility, corruption and fanaticism that have prevailed during the last
                        three would result in, not only the complete ruin and exhaustion of the
                        country, but in division, and the total overthrow of republican
                        institutions. Will the people try the experiment? We trust not.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>That Pennsylvania is unprepared to respond immediately to the call of the
                        Government for troops for instant service, is altogether to be ascribed to
                        the last Legislature. That body met in January last, and with the experience
                        of Gettysburg and Chambersburg, and the memories of 1862 before it,
                        proceeded deliberately to do everything else but attend to the interests of
                        the country. The public Halls at Harrisburg were filled with venal and
                        corrupt men. The full attention of the "honorable members" was given to
                        schemes which promised them personal advantages. Their time and their
                        efforts could not be commanded for anything which did not promise them crops
                        of bribes and harvests of corruption. Hence their whole time was taken up
                        with subjects of special legislation. Charters for corporations of all kinds
                        were the only matters that were in favor. Almost every man sent to
                        Harrisburg seemed to imagine that he was deputed for the especial purpose of
                        making himself rich. The public interests were nothing to him. He had enough
                        to do to take care of his own. Hence the statute book is loaded down with
                        special laws, and little of public character is to be found therein.</p>
                    <p>We cut the above from the Philadelphia Inquirer of
                        yesterday. It is the sad truth, told by a Republican journal of a Republican
