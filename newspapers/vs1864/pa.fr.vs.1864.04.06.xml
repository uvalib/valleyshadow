                    <p>Culpeper, VA <lb/>March 20th, 1864.</p>
                    <p>To the Editor of "The Valley Spirit:"</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Messrs. Editors</emph>--You may no doubt wonder at this
                        strange, and, perhaps, unbecoming manner of introduction. Yet I am a member
                        of your community, and, at one time, a citizen of the town of Chambersburg.
                        I am now a soldier in the Army of the Potomac. My period of enlistment dates
                        from August, eighteen hundred and sixty-two, (1862.)--I enlisted in company
                        D, of the 149th Pennsylvania volunteers. Our regiment, during the early
                        period of its service, was detained very fortunately, in Washington, D.C.,
                        as guard for the city. We remained in the city about six months, when we
                        were ordered to the field for active duty; and we have been here since
                        February of 1863. Our regiment was slightly engaged in the battle of
                        Chancellorsville, and in the battle of Gettysburg we were seriously
                        weakened; for we were hotly engaged the first day, and if the regiment had
                        remained a few moments longer in the fight, or if we had not received orders
                        to fall back, the regiment would have been annihilated.</p>
                    <p>But you may think from the tone of my letter that I wish to speak in glowing
                        terms of our bravery and conduct as a regiment; not so. We did nothing more
                        than our duty, and nothing more than we will do again.</p>
                    <p>Two of my brothers are to-day prisoners in Richmond; one is discharged on
                        account of the wounds he received at the Second Battle of Bull Run; and my
                        aged father is now a veteran soldier encamped at Chambersburg. In justice I
                        can boast of the patriotism of the family to which I belong, and which I
                        feel proud to own.</p>
                    <p>Could a few more boast in the same manner, our country would long ere this
                        have thrown off the dark livery of mourning--the Union preserved, and the
                        soldiers of this army would to-day bask in the sweet bowers of a blessed
                        peace. Yes, if a few of the brave stay-at-home of Chambersburg and
                        vicin[i]ty would send out just one from every third family, it would look
                        more like devoted patriotism and genuine manliness than home cowardice.
                        Where, I ask, where were your emergency men during the awful battle on our
                        own soil; perchance skulking behind some place that would shelter them from
                        rebel bullets; and some, perhaps, running to the mountains and hills, and
                        calling upon them to hid them from the coming rebels. I hope some will take
                        timely warning and enlist; for I assure them "Old Abe" will draft them, and
                        then they will be compelled to run to the hills and mountains to screen them
                        from the presence of the enrolling officer. I fear I am trespassing on your
                        patience, if so, you can indulge a soldier in these few remarks.</p>
                    <p>Philip Bowers, <lb/>Company D, 149th Reg't Pa. Vols.</p>
                    <p>[If our correspondent would take the trouble to inform himself in relation to
                        the matter, he would find that Chambersburg is as well represented,
                        numerically, in the army as any town of its population in the country. It

                        commanded by Col. Wm. H. Boyd. The presentation speech was made by our

                    <p>This well known and popular Hotel has passed into the hands of Mr. Wm. C.
                        McNulty, who took possession on the 1st instant, having leased it for a term
                        of years. Mr. M. formerly conducted a Hotel in McConnelsburg, and latterly
                        the Holler House in Greencastle, where by his gentlemanly deportment,
                        attention to the comfort of his guests, and bountiful board, he achieved a
                        high reputation as a landlord and satisfied every one that he "knows how to
                        keep a Hotel." We feel satisfied that the Franklin under his management,
                        will maintain the position it has long enjoyed as a first class public
                        House.</p>
