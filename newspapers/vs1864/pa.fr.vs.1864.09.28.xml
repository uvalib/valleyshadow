                    of the rebellion; who, on their part, desire above all things, a permanent

                <transcript>
                    <p>The only true road to peace and Union, lies in a return on the part of the
                        National Administration to the doctrines of the Critenden resolution passed
                        by Congress at the commencement of the war, as declaratory of the ends and
                        objects to be attained by it; namely, the return of the Seceded States to
                        their allegiance to the Constitution and laws of the country. Since the
                        passage of that resolution, by Congress, the party in power has diverted the
                        war to other purposes, and now declares that the unconditional submission of
                        the rebels can alone end it. Conditional submission <emph rend="italic">to
                            what</emph>? This is the great question all the time. The people of the
                        rebel States have declared that they were fighting for independence but does
                        any one believe that if they were assured that the government of the country
                        would be administered in accordance with the Constitution as our fathers
                        made it, so that it were rendered impossible to interfere with the reserved
                        rights of the States, that they--the <emph rend="italic">people</emph> of
                        the South--would not soon throw their leaders overboard, and gladly to
                        return to the shelter of the Union. It is in this view that, under the
                        policy declared by Mr. Lincoln and his party, that they cannot have equal
                        rights in the Union, that they are, as they say, fighting for independence.
                        This is the very life and strength of the rebellion. They are required to
                        submit to <emph rend="italic">something</emph> they know not what, but not
                        to the Constitution. It is this idea, pervading the whole South, that has
                        enabled the rebel rulers to raise and keep up armies to fight against the
                        Union; and so long as this idea is retained by the people of that section,
                        and no effort is made on part of the government to disabuse their minds of
                        the impression, the present sanguinary struggle may continue until mutual
                        exhaustion compels a cessation of hostilities. When the rebel in arms is
                        told that he must submit, he very naturally asks <emph rend="italic">to
                            what?</emph> If to a government which denies to him what the
                        Constitution of the country guarantees, he indignantly spurns the act, but
                        if it be unconditional submission to <emph rend="italic">the
                        Constitution</emph> which guarantees ample protection--protection as ample
                        as he can gain by independence--the latent love in his heart for the old
                        Union of his fathers, will revive in his breast and he will lay down his
                        arms at once.</p>
                    <p>The time, in the history of this rebellion, when passion must give way to
                        reason has arrived. Argument and conciliation must be used to convince these
                        men in the South that they are wrong--madly, wickedly, desperately wrong.
                        The false impressions created in the minds of the Southern people, by their
                        ambitious and designing leaders, must be removed by a return to the first
                        principles on which this war was waged.</p>
                    <p>The present Administration so far from acting on the policy which wisdom,
                        right and justice dictates, and endeavoring to convince the Southern people,
                        by its acts, of a determination to guarantee to them all their rights under
                        the Constitution, has adopted a policy the very reverse. It has destroyed
                        State lines and uprooted institutions founded in the laws and customs of
                        their section, and punished them for obeying an irresistible force against
                        which they had a right to ask its protection, and against which it had not
                        the power to protect them. The Administration has by its confiscation acts,
                        its emancipation proclamations and kindred measures, left the Southern
                        people no other alternative but to fight on to the bitter end, and has added
                        fuel to the flame of sectional hate; thus playing into the hands of the
                        leaders of the rebellion; who, on their part, desire above all things, a
                        permanent division of the Union. Had the true policy, the policy on which
                        the war was conducted in its earlier stages, been adhered to, and their
                        rights of property not been threatened by unconstitutional acts of Congress
                        and executive proclamations freeing the negroes, these leaders would have
                        been deserted by the mass of the Southern people, and ere this, we verily
                        believe, would have returned to their allegiance. But it seems that the
                        rulers to which Providence for some wise purpose of His own, has for a time
                        committed the destinies of our country, do not desire that the Union shall
                        be restored under the Constitution which for eighty years has given us
                        peace, prosperity and safety. They desire a new Union and a new
                        Constitution, under and by which, the black man shall become the [illegible]
                        of the white, and take a position in this land of ours clothed with all the
                        rights and privileges which we believe cannot with safety to us, or profit
                        to them, be conferred upon them. To this end they are sacrificing thousands
                        of the bravest youths of our land and millions of money wrung from the hands
                        of those "who earn their bread by the sweat of their brow" by a system of
                        taxation that must ultimately become too heavy to be borne. To the misguided
                        people of the South they say there can be no peace without your
                        "unconditional submission." Unconditional submission <emph rend="italic">to
                            what?</emph> To the Constitution and laws of the country? No! but to the
                        terms we shall dictate, the first of which is, the total abolition of
                        slavery. This is their condition precedent even to entering upon
                        negotiations with the rebels with a view to bringing the war to a close.
                        Under this condition there can be no peace without the utter subjugation and
                        extermination of the Southern people.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand how do the Democracy propose to bring about the restoration
                        of the Union and the return of peace to this distracted land? With them
                            "<emph rend="italic">the Union is the one condition of peace</emph> and
                        the only one. In the words of their noble standard bearer</p>
                    <p>"So soon as it is clear, or even probable, that our present adversaries are
                        ready for peace upon the basis of the Union, we should exhaust all the
                        resources of statesmanship practiced by civilized nations, and taught by the
                        traditions of the American people, consistent with the honor and interests
                        of the country, to secure such peace, re-establish the Union, and guarantee
                        for the future the constitutional rights of every State."</p>
                    <p>This paragraph shows the entire difference between the present Administration
                        and the Democracy. In it, it is proposed to exhaust all the resources of
                        statesmanship to end the war honorably to both sections. To hold out the
                        olive branch with one hand, whilst the sword is grasped firmly by the other.
                        It too calls submission, not submission to an arbitrary edict, but to the
                        laws and the Constitution as interpreted by the good and wise men of the
                        past. In effect it says: consent to the Union and you yourselves shall aid
                        in determining upon what condition it shall exist hereafter. This is the
                        submission which will be required by the Democratic party, from those who
                        have taken up arms against the government. And when such submission is
                        yielded by the rebels, the object for which the war was prosecuted is
                        attained, the Temple of Janus will again be closed, and peace once more
                        dispense its blessings over a re-united, prosperous and happy people. "The
                        Union is the one condition of peace. We ask no more."</p>

                        succeeded in making black-guards of themselves. The temper of the Democracy
                        at this time is such, as not to bear very patiently the insults and
                        interruptions of these fellows, at their meetings, and we warn these

                        and at Greencastle on the next evening, a little daughter of Mr. William
                        Ward was struck on the head by a large stone thrown at the speaker by some
                        miscreant who richly deserves what he will ultimately get, a halter. The
                        little girl was so seriously injured that her life was dispaired [sic] of. A
                        liberal reward has been offered for the discovery of the rascal who threw
                        the stone, and if found out, he will be properly punished for the dastardly
                        act.</p>

                        loss. Over two thousand five hundred prisoners were captured and also nine
                        battle flags and five pieces of artillery. The rebel Generals Gordon and
                        Rhodes were killed and three other general officers wounded, all of the
                        killed and most of the wounded were left in our hands. The rebel General
                        retreated to the neighborhood of Strasburg and took up a position on
                        Fisher's Hill where he was again attacked by Sheridan and completely routed,
                        the particulars of which will be found in our news columns. Our citizens can
                        now rest assured that they will not be subjected to rebel incursions. There
                        is a "five man" at the head of the army in the Valley. There is nothing new
                        from the Armies of the Potomac and the Cumberland.</p>

                        <emph rend="italic">To Lieut. General Grant, commanding the army of the
                            United States, City Point:</emph>
                    </p>
                    <p>I have the honor to report that I have achieved a most signal victory over
                        the army of Gen. Early, at Fisher's Hill to-day.</p>
                    <p>I found the rebel army posted with its right resting on the north fork of the
                        Shenandoah, and extending across the Strasburg valley westward to North
                        Mountain, occupying a position which appeared almost impregnable.</p>
                    <p>After a good deal of manoeuvering during the day, Gen. Crook's command was
                        transferred to the extreme right of the line on the North Mountain, and he
                        furiously attacked the left of the enemy's line, carrying everything before
                        him. While Crook was driving the enemy in the greatest confusion, and
                        sweeping and driving them behind their breastworks, the 6th and 19th army
                        corps attacked the rebel works in front, and the whole rebel army appeared
                        to be broken up.</p>
                    <p>They fled in the utmost confusion. Sixteen pieces of artillery were captured;
                        also a great many caissons, artillery horses etc., etc.</p>
                    <p>I am tonight pushing on down the valley.</p>
                    <p>I cannot say how many prisoners I have captured, nor do I know either my own
                        or the enemy's casualties. Only the darkness saved the whole of Early's army
                        from total destruction.</p>
                    <p>My attack could not be made until four o'clock in the evening, which left but
                        little daylight to operate in.</p>
                    <p>The first and third cavalry divisions went down the Luray Valley to-day, and
                        if they push vigorously to the main valley, the result of the day's
                        engagement will be still more signal.</p>
                    <p>The victory was very complete.</p>
                    <p>A more detailed report will be made as soon as I can obtain the necessary
                        date.</p>
                    <p>P. H. Sheridan, <lb/>Major General Commanding.</p>
                    <p>It will be remembered that Early's command embraced the Stonewall Brigade,
                        and troops constituting Stonewall Jackson's Corps, and was the elite of the
                        rebel army.</p>
                    <p>Edwin M. Stanton, <lb/>Secretary of War. <lb/>Baltimore, Sept. 22.</p>
                    <p>Medical and surgical skill is sadly need at Winchester. I have been requested
                        to make known the want through your columns. There are five thousand
                        wearied, suffering men in that little town in want of immediate attention.
                        Christian Commission delegates are hastening there, but not in sufficient
                        strength for immediate purposes.</p>
                    <p>The accounts that reach us from the valley indicate that our victory has been
                        greater in results than even first thought or dreamed of. It was an
                        old-fashioned cavalry fight, and the sequel was attributed to the superior
                        mettle of our army.</p>
                    <p>Early had at least eighteen thousand infantry supported by approved guns and
                        handled by experienced gunners. The victory and rout surprises military men,
                        as we have no precedent for it in the history of this war. They do not tire
                        of reviewing it, and speak in laudatory terms of the military acumen that
                        directed a fight at once so novel and yet so successful.</p>
                    <p>This is the second triumph that has been distinctly a cavalry triumph, when
                        our troops have been engaged in a general contest. The cavalry service,
                        through its officers, feel highly honored by this contest, and the army and
                        the public will cheerfully vote them their due meed of thanks and
                        acknowledgment.</p>
                    <p>Winchester is one vast hospital. Barns and dwellings, and even out-houses,
                        being filled by our own and rebel wounded. They are receiving all the
                        attention that the limited means at hand can furnish. No wounded have
                        arrived as yet at Harper's Ferry, but they are shortly expected in the
                        course of transit.</p>
                    <p>The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad will be in running order through to Wheeling,
