<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The 21st Pennsylvania cavalry, Col. Wm. H. Boyd, recently encamped near this
                        place--several companies of which belong to this county--are now near
                        Washington city. We learn that an order has been received requiring the
                        regiment to turn over all their horses, arms and equipment and report to
                        General Casey for duty as Infantry. This order
                        has caused much dissatisfaction amongst the officers and men, and to say the
                        least of it, is certainly taking a slight
                        advantage of them. They entered the service as cavalry, bargaining to serve
                        as such, and never imagined a change to a different arm. There can be but
                        one excuse for the government coming the "false pretense" game over these
                        men; the exigencies of the service may require the change, and if so, the
                        men should cheerfully acquiesce hard as it may seem, to be thus
                        disappointed.</p>
                    <p>The regiment is over twelve hundred strong, the company of Capt. Hullinger
                        numbering one hundred men, being at present on detached duty at
                    Scranton.</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Author attacks a Repository article insinuating that Copperheads aided a
                    deserter's escape.<br>(Names in announcement:   ,   )</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In a local item in the last issue of the Repository, narrating the escape of a deserter occurs the following
                        language:</p>
                    <p>He must have been aided by persons in this place, and taken off on horseback
                        or in a buggy. Can any of our copperheads guess as to how he escaped?</p>
                    <p>We are well aware that knaves and fools make up a large portion of the
                        abolition party but are at a loss to decide to which of these classes the
                        writer of the above belongs. A knave, we think, would have more discretion
                        than to write such nonsense and we therefore incline to the opinion that the
                        author is simply a fool, and a very great one at that. He must consequently
                        be acquitted of any knavish design in the matter. We advise the editor of
                        the Repository to take the man to a Phrenologist
                        and have his head examined. There is something wrong in it sure!</p>
