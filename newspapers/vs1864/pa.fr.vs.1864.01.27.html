<b>The Negro and the War</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors argue that the gradual emancipation of the slaves by advancing
                    Union armies has hurt the blacks more than it has helped them.<br>(Names in announcement:  Abraham Lincoln,  D.L. Jones,  Henton Jackson)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Although Mr. Lincoln's emancipation proclamation has been powerless for good
                        within the rebel lines--as idle as "the Pope's bull against the
                        comet"--failing in its weakness to strike the shackles from the limbs of a
                        single slave that could aid the rebellion; yet as our lines have advanced,
                        it has nominally liberated thousands; and as the armies of the Union march
                        on, "conquering and to conquer," it may liberate thousands more. The effect
                        of this proclamation has simply been to free the slaves from their masters,
                        and while it provides no remedy for the evils of slavery, leaves them in
                        filthy camps to die of starvation and disease. Deadened as the sensibilities
                        of the whole nation have become to scenes of suffering and distress, the
                        tales of horror which come up to us from the camps of freed negroes along
                        the Mississippi cannot fail to enlist our sympathies. The poor blacks, left
                        to the tender mercies of their pretended friends, are dying daily by fifties
                        and hundreds; and unless something be done to better their condition, the
                        whole race must soon be blotted out, and this war, which has been perverted
                        from its orignal [sic] purpose to aid in their enfranchisement, may result
                        in their total extinction. A recent report made by Mr. Yeatman, president of
                        the Western Sanitary Commission, portrays the horrors of the contraband
                        camps along the Mississippi in such fitting terms that we will transfer a
                        few paragraphs to our columns. He says:</p>
                    <p>"At Young's Point, D. L. Jones, of the 9th Louisiana Regiment, African
                        descent, is in charge of the camp. There are now some 2,100 in this camp, in
                        miserable huts, tents and hovels. There appears to be more squalid misery
                        and destitution here than in any place I have visited. The sickness and
                        deaths were most frightful. During the summer, from thirty to fifty died in
                        a day, and some days as many as seventy-five during the latter part of June,
                        July and August.</p>
                    <p>"At DeSoto, immediately opposite Vicksburg, there are about 275 old men,
                        women and children, to whom the Government furnishes rations, but from some
                        cause or other none had been received for more than two weeks preceding my
                        visit, and great destitution and dissatisfaction existed.</p>
                    <p>"At Natchez is a camp of 2,100 freedmen, all in cabins, which are without
                        proper light and ventilation, overcrowded, and most prolific sources of
                        disease. Seventy-five had died in one day. I was informed that some had
                        returned to their masters on account of suffering. Physicians are greatly
                        needed.</p>
                    <p>"This camp had numbered four thousand at one time, now it is reduced to
                        2,100--a sad tale to tell, but nevertheless true. The same I doubt not can
                        be said of other camps. Whoever will ride along the levee from Milliken's
                        Bend to De Soto, as I did, and see the numerous graves along the way, for
                        the distance of twenty-five miles, cannot doubt it."</p>
                    <p>This is the glorious jubilee of freedom to which Mr. Lincoln invites the
                        slaves of the South. It is for such liberty as this he asks them to leave
                        their master's plantations, where they were comfortably housed, clothed and
                        fed; where they were tenderly cared for in helpless youth and feeble old
                        age; where in sickness they received their medicines from the master's
                        store, and gentle nursing from the members of his household. Aye, let our
                        canting philanthropists talk to them of the blessings of liberty--let them
                        go and tell these starving contrabands what an inestimable privilege it is
                        to be a free man--and they will reply "Give us bread for ourselves and our
                        hungry wives and little ones; give us houses to shelter our shivering limbs
                        from the rains and snows of winter; give us medicine that we may not die
                        like dumb cattle, and you may take back your boasted liberty!" What are the
                        blessings of liberty, which we hear so much about, to suffering, starving,
                        dying men? What does it profit to tell a man he is free, and deprive him of
                        his bread?</p>
                    <p>This pretended philanthropy is as insincere as it is ruinous. The very men
                        who have advised and sanctioned this emancipation proclamation, who have
                        cried out the loudest against the poor compensation given to slave labor and
                        the evil treatment of slaves by their masters, are the ones who are to-day
                        profiting by the labor of the liberated slaves, who defraud them out of
                        their earnings, who subject them to a sorer bondage than they have ever
                        before experienced. In confirmation of this statement we again refer to the
                        report of Mr. Yeatman:</p>
                    <p>The firemen on the steamboat on which I was a passenger from St. Louis to
                        Memphis were all colored, and were receiving forty-five dollars per month.
                        These men were afraid to go ashore at Memphis, for fear of being picked up
                        and forced into Government, employment at less than one fourth their
                        existing wages. Beside the fact that men are thus pressed into service,
                        thousands have been employed for weeks and months who never received
                        anything but promises to pay.</p>
                    <p>This negligence and failure to comply with obligations have greatly
                        disheartened he poor slave, who comes forth at the call of the President,
                        and supports himself a free man, and that by leaving his rebel master he is
                        inflicting a blow on the enemy, ceasing to labor and to provide food for him
                        and for the armies of the Rebellion. Thus he was promised freedom, but how
                        is it with him? He is seized in the street, and ordered to go and help
                        unload a steamboat for which he will be paid, or sent to work in the
                        trenches, or to labor for some Quartermaster, or to chop wood for the
                        Government. He labors for months, and at last is only paid with promises,
                        unless perchance it may be with kicks, cuffs and curses. Under such
                        treatment he feels that he has exchanged one master for many masters; these
                        continued abuses sadden and depress him, and he sighs to return to his
                        former home and master. He, at least, fed, clothed and sheltered him.</p>
                    <p>"One of the freedmen, Henson Jackson, working at Wilton's plantation, said
                        that they get corn wherever they can find it on abandoned plantations: that
                        they frequently have to go as far as Tensas Bayou, that he has been without
                        bread for days, that four pounds of meat per week are all that is allowed
                        him, that he pays for his flour, and has worked since April without
                        receiving any pay or clothing whatever, that he only receives tickets for
                        actual days work, to be paid when the crop is sold. Others from the same
                        farm testified to the same thing and laborers from other plantations give
                        similar testimony. None received molasses, rice, or beans, and hominy only
                        when they choose to make it themselves.</p>
                    <p>"The poor negroes are everywhere greatly depressed at their condition. They
                        all testify that if they were only paid their little wages as they earn
                        them, so that they could purchase clothing, and were furnished with the
                        provisions promised, they could stand it; but to work and get poorly paid,
                        poorly fed, and not doctored when sick, is more than they can endure. They
                        do not realize that they are free men. They say they are told they are, but
                        then they are taken and hired out to men who treat them, so far as providing
                        for them is concerned, far worse than their "secesh" masters did. Besides
                        this they feel that their pay or hire is lower now than it was when "the
                        secesh" used to hire them. This is true."</p>
                    <p>This accounts for the canting hypocrisy of these abolition fanatics. They
                        wanted to reap some benefit from the labor of the negroes of the South, and
                        hence their pretended friendship. Their grasping cupidity denies to the
                        slave even the wages his old master gave him. True is it that he has but
                        exchanged one master for many masters; and no wonder is it, that he sighs
                        for his former home and master, who at least, fed, clothed and sheltered
                        him. Says Mr. Yeatman, "They do not realize that they are free men. They say
                            they are told they are, but then they are
                        taken and hired out to men who treat them worse than
                            their 'secesh' masters did!" This is "the great moral idea" which
                        we are told is being worked out under the Providence of a God of Justice!
                        This is the spirit of freedom and equality which breathes through our
                        institutions, and animates the charter of our liberties, and finds its
                        warrant in the Gospel! Isn't the idea a grand and ennobling one?</p>
                    <p>There is another feature of this negro question which is every day becoming
                        of vaster importance. We are placing arms in the hands of hundreds of
                        thousands of fierce and untutored slaves. Is it expected that when the war
                        is over they will quietly lay down those arms? They will be acquainted with
                        army drill and tactics, they will have learned the modes of organizing
                        armies and conducting campaigns. Will they not strike a blow for this
                        "liberty and equality," of which they have heard so much, but which they
                        have never realized? After England had armed the Sepoys of India, they rose
                        against the dominant race and deluged the land in blood. How was it when the
                        subject race in St. Domingo had arms in their hands? May we not have similar
                        scenes enacted within the United States? Let every man put the case to his
                        own heart, and suppose that he belonged to this negro army of three hundred
                        thousand. Would he be content to lay down his arms until negro equality was
                        acknowled [sic] in its fullest and freest terms? Would he now contend that
                        he had been wronged by the very men who professed to be his friends, and
                        would he not strike to avenge that wrong? When we look at this question, we
                        cannot resist the thought that the darkest and bloodiest chapter in the
                        history of America is yet to be written.</p>
                    <p>But we are told the negroes are to be colonized. We must remember, however,
                        that the consent of the negro himself must be obtained to this scheme, and
                        probably he will prefer to live in the United States. He will have the
                        power, backed by an army of three hundred thousand of his own race, and he
                        will use it. After this war is over, the negro will live just where he
                        pleases. But suppose this should not be the case, colonization has proved a
                        miserable failure. The President and the Secretary of State tried the
                        experiment, during the last year. A colony was sent to the Isle De Vache, we
                        believe one of the West Indies, and news has already been brought back that
                        it is on the verge of ruin. An agent of the government has returned and
                        reports the colonists well nigh starved to death, and unless the government
                        sends a steamer to return them to the United States very soon, not one of
                        them will be left alive. The island is fertile, the climate genial, the
                        colonists were well equipped with all the necessaries of life and labor; but
                        ignorant, thriftless and improvident, they have sunk beneath the weight of
                        their own independence. Thus ends the first experiment of establishing a
                        grand African Utopia. Truly may we say, in view of these facts, that the
                        Abolitionists have wrought out for the negro nothing but evil and that
                        continually.</p>

<b>Our Washington Letter</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A correspondent in Washington, D.C. writes the editors to describe the
                    latest congressional events. He relates a dispute between Senators Wilson and
                    Davis over the resolution of the former to expel the latter from the Senate for
                    alleged disloyal language. He also notes that there are a large number of
                    destitute women in Washington who have come to tend to the sick or claim the
                    dead, but who cannot get home again and must turn to "starvation or dishonor."
                    He hopes that the government, which is supporting "hundreds of lazy
                    contrabands," can do something about the situation. He reports that the

                    doubt anticipating, says the writer, further meddling by civilians in military
