<b>Ought a President to Re-Elect Himself</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This writer argues that President Lincoln is contemplating an attempt to
                    subvert the electoral process in order to engineer his re-election. His control
                    over the Republican political machinery, his ability to use the votes of
                    Republican troops, and his willingness to subvert political liberties all point
                    to the likelihood that Lincoln will do whatever it takes to stay in office.<br>

<b>"Loyalty" and Damages</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors note the introduction of a bill in the state legislature to pay
                    damages to those who sustained losses during the Confederate raids. However,
                    they add, a preamble added that required citizens to offer proof of loyalty
                    before they could be repaid is inappropriate and insulting. None of the charges
                    of disloyalty lodged against the citizens of Franklin County are true, say the
                    editors, and the names associated with these charges have only the most tenuous
                    connections to the county.<br>(Names in announcement:   Fitzhugh,   Logan,   Fishel,   Fisher)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We were always of the opinion that the leaders of the Republican party were
                        insincere in their advocacy of the payment, by the State or Federal
                        government, of damages sustained by our citizens from rebel raids and
                        invasions. That opinion was confirmed by the proceedings in the House of
                        Representatives, on Wednesday last. On the Monday previous, Mr. Sharpe
                        introduced a supplement to the set of 22d April 1863, providing for the
                        adjudication and payment of claims arising from losses by the rebel invasion
                        in June last, and moved that the bill and the whole subject matter be
                        referred to a select committee of five. On Wednesday, however, the following
                        preambles and resolution were offered by Mr. Kelley:</p>
                    <p>Whereas, There is reason to believe that the rebel
                        invasions of Pennsylvania, were, in a great measure, brought about through
                        the connivance and by the encouragement of disloyal persons in our own
                        State;</p>
                    <p>And Whereas, Claims for damages done during those
                        invasions are now being presented to this Legislature; therefore,</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That the select committee to whom are
                        referred all matters in relation to claims arising out of alleged losses
                        from the rebel raids of 1862 and 1863, be instructed to report as part of
                        their bill--if they report a bill--a clause requiring the parties presenting
                        claims to furnish positive proofs of their loyalty.</p>
                    <p>The first preamble contains an imputation upon the loyalty of the citizens of
                        the border counties, at once so foul and false, that it must challenge the
                        indignant reprobation of all our people, of whatever political party. We
                        scornfully hurl back the charge that "the rebel invasions of Pennsylvania
                        were brought about through the connivance and by the encouragement of
                        disloyal persons in our own State." Of the two men alluded to as citizens of
                        Franklin county in the debate--Fitzhugh and Logan--the former was a native
                        of Maryland or Virginia, resided in our State but a few years, and at the
                        time of the rebel invasion was a citizen of Maryland; neither is it true
                        that he acted as a guide to the rebel Stuart in his raid; he was captured by
                        our forces in Maryland, during the first rebel invasion of that State,
                        previous to Stuart's raid. Logan was a native of this county, but has for a
                        number of years resided in Maryland, from which State he joined the rebel
                        army. About the two men convicted by court martial, at this place, of
                        leading the rebels, Fishel and Fisher we believe are their names, no one
                        here knows anything. They are certainly not citizens of Franklin county, and
                        we do not know that they are citizens of the State. From the charges
                        preferred against them they seem to be ignorant, drunken, degraded
                        stragglers, without home or occupation. Their sins be upon their own heads,
                        we have nothing to do with them. As Mr. Sharpe well observed in his eloquent
                        defense of the people of Franklin county: "It is contrary to the instincts
                        of human nature, it is opposed to all human reason, to suppose that any man
                        would make such a fool of himself as to invite into the peaceful home where
                        he lived a band of vandals, who would lay waste and destroy not only his own
                        property, but the property of all his neighbors."</p>
                    <p>But the resolution provides that parties presenting claims for damages must
                        "furnish positive proof of their loyalty." How is this "positive proof" to
                        be obtained? Is a test oath to be administered? Must everybody take the oath
                        Mr. Lincoln has prescribed for the rebels--swear to support the confiscation
                        act, the emancipation proclamation, or any other unconstitutional
                        proclamation the President, in his infinite wisdom, may see fit to issue?
                        This oath is now the great test of "loyalty" in the eyes of the party in
                        power. They stigmatise the whole Democratic party as "disloyal," and as a
                        matter of course every Democrat who presents his claim for damages must take
                        this oath, or present other "positive proof" of his "loyalty." In the good
                        old times that have gone by, every man was presumed innocent until he was
                        proved guilty; but under the new regime the citizens of Franklin and the
                        other border counties are all to be considered guilty of treason, unless
                        they purge themselves of the charge by "positive proof," before a partisan
                        commission. And what justice can be expected from such a commission as this,
                        with full authority to decide upon the "loyalty" or "disloyalty" of their
                        fellow citizens? Truly these are strange and startling times in which we
                        live!</p>
                    <p>The object of this resolution is two-fold. First to give some coloring to the
                        charge of disloyalty which has been for the last three years made
                        indiscriminately against the whole Democratic party; and secondly indirectly
                        to kill the bill. It is high time that this malignant partisan malevolence
                        had run itself out. The Democratic party has borne these insults and
                        imputations until forbearance has almost ceased to be a virtue. So long as
                        they ended in mere vituperation, they were but regarded as the idle wind;
                        but when they are sought as a means of affecting the rights and interests of
                        a large portion of the community, we think we do not misunderstand the
                        temper of the public mind when we say they will not much longer be submitted
                        to. It has been determined to kill this bill as a rebuke to the counties
                        claiming damages, for sending Democratic members and senators to the
                        Legislature. Had we given large Abolition majorities, there then would have
                        been no difficulty in the passage of this bill as it was originally
                        presented. Could partisan meanness go farther than this?</p>
                    <p>We hope our Democratic members will oppose all amendments to the bill, and
                        defeat the bill itself, rather than have this odious provision incorporated
                        into it.--It will be far better to have no adjustment of claims at all than
                        on which will discriminate between citizens on account of their political
                        belief. All should be paid their claims or none at all.</p>

<b>Which, "On Foot," or "On a Black Mare"</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors report a charge in the state legislature that a Democratic
                    resident of Franklin County informed the Confederates of Col. Alexander
                    McClure's escape from his home on a black horse. In fact, said the editors, it
                    is well known that "the gallant Colonel" escaped at night, on foot, by way of
                    Rutherford's lane.<br>(Names in announcement: Col. Alexander McClure)</blockquote>

                    will include all able-bodied men between 10 and 45, with no money commutation
                    clause. This way, it will be stringent enough to "'gobble up' a fair share of

                    decries the disfranchisement of voters qualified under the Constitution who
                    refuse to take a loyalty oath, as well as the declaration of certain parts of
                    Louisiana's Constitution as being inoperable. It is a further sign, concludes
                    the writer, of the reduction of whites to slavery while elevating the status of
                    blacks.<br>
