<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The news from the front is not as encouraging as we could wish. Secretary
                        Stanton has ceased issuing war bulletins for the reason that our military
                        operations recently have been a series of defeats and disappoin[t]ments. The
                        disaster to a portion of our left wing on Wednesday last must have been a
                        severe mortification to the whole army. It seems the rebels succeeded in
                        capturing an entire brigade of Union troops. General Hunter's movement
                        against Lynchburg has also proved a failure. He was repulsed in the direct
                        attack upon that city, and now it is semi-officially announced that he is in
                        retreat to West Virginia. Thus ends the second combined movement against the
                        rebel capital. The first failed when Sigel was beaten in the Valley and
                        Butler failed in his assault upon Fort Darling. The second great combined
                        movement was to isolate the rebel capital by cutting off its communications
                        on every side. Grant himself was to capture Petersburg, Hunter Lynchburg,
                        and Sheridan was to destroy the Gordonsville Railroad. Each of these
                        movements has resulted in a failure, and General Grant must now form new
                        combinations. It is idle any longer to talk of starving out the rebels. The
                        roads northwest and southwest from Richmond are no longer even menaced. The
                        only real good news at hand is that the road south from Petersburg is
                        securely in possession of our army. This is no doubt an inconvenience to the
                        rebels, but that is all. It of itself effects no important object. We wish
                        we could write in a more hopeful strain; but the people are entitled to know
                        the truth.</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Authors defend themselves against criticism from the Repository about the
                    Valley Spirit's language in a recent article about Lincoln's and Johnson's
                    renominations.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Repository seems to have been much exercised
                        by an article in a recent issue of our paper, copied as an editorial from
                        the New York World, in which "Old Abe" is
                        denominated "a rail-splitting buffoon," and Andy Johnston "a boorish
                        tailor." The deduction by the Repository
                        therefrom that "it (the SPIRIT) revolts at the propositions to elect a
                        laborer and a mechanic to the first offices of the nation" is, to say the
                        least of it, disingenuous, and as refreshing a specimen of claptrap as has
                        lately come under our notice. A rails-plitter [sic], having opportunities of
                        culture and improving them, may become a learned and able statesman; and a
                        tailor by the same means, may attain an exalted position and occupy it
                        worthily; but a rail-splitting "buffoon" is scarcely the man to whom the
                        helm of a great nation should be confided in the hour of its most imminent
                        peril; nor is a "boorish" tailor, best fitted to preside in the most
                        dignified body of the world. It is not only buffoons who are
                        "rail-splitters," and tailors who are "boors," that are unfitted for such
                        exalted positions as the presidency and Vice Presidency, in times like the
                        present. We would make the same objection to buffoons and boors from any
                        other station in life, whether lawyers, doctors, clergymen, or even
                        newspaper editors. If President Lincoln has shaken off his buffoonery and
                        risen up to the full standard of statesmanship required in his position by
                        the perils which environ the country, and if Andy Johnston has acquired, by
                        culture, sufficient knowledge to entitle him to respect in the sphere to
                        which he aspires, the fact that the one was a rail-splitter, and the other a
                        tailor, would not, in our opinion, unfit them for the highest positions ever
                        attained by mortal men; but if "Abe," when he ceased splitting rails, still
                        remained a buffoon, and "Andy," when he relinquished an honest calling to
                        play demagogue, still remained a boor--as we have good reason to believe is
                        the case--we have nothing to take back, and are free to say that this
                        precious pair of worthies are not the men to manage with credit to
                        themselves, or profit to the country, the affairs of this great Republic in
                        a contest, which, if controlled much longer by unskilled hands, may prove
                        its death struggle.</p>

                        were sent to Colonel Green's Freedman's Colony. All the men able to work are
                        employed in the Quarter master's Department. The Colony is in a most
                        thriving condition, having three thousand acres under a high state of
                        cultivation, and crops of wheat and rye that promise a harvest valued at ten
                        thousand dollars." This is how the negroes stay in the South, as we were
                        told they would by our Abolition friends. This is how they are taken care of
                        and feasted on the fat of the land while soldiers families are suffering the
                        pangs of want--not to mention the fact that poor white Union refugees are
                        daily starving for food and perishing of hardships.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The an[n]iversary of our National Independence is fast approaching, but as
                        yet we have heard of no arrangement being in progress, in our midst, for its
                        proper observance. We are sorry to observe of late years, a decreasing
                        interest, on the part of our citizens in properly celebrating the nation's
                        birth-day and would be pleased to again participate in an old-fashioned
                        celebration, Spread-Eagle "oration," "regular toasts," "volunteer toasts"
                        and all. For upwards of eighty years our country has been blessed beyond all
                        the nations of the earth, enjoying a degree of happiness and prosperity
                        without a parallel, all resulting from the actions of our fathers on the 4th
                        day of July 1776. This accursed rebellion now afflicting our beloved
                        country, fostered and kept alive as it is, by the mistaken policy of those
                        who are charged with its suppression must end sometime, and prosperity and
                        peace once more bless us with their smiles. Let us, then, keep up the usual
                        celebration of the day, even during the present troubles of the country:
                        hoping that in the end we may have another day on which to celebrate the
                        re-union of these states under the constitution our fathers gave us, and
                        under the folds of that Star Spangled flag, which for eig[h]ty-eight years,
                        has been as a beacon to the oppressed of all nations, and the pride and

                    <p>There has been no very heavy firing within the last few days, but skirmishing
                        is kept up all along the line. The cannonading at times is heard. Firing was
                        heard about 5 miles from Bermuda Hundred on Saturday, where General Butler
                        is entrenched.</p>
                    <p>The enemy made an attack upon Butler's entrenchments but did not succeed in
                        effecting anything and were driven off. On Saturday the rebels attacked
                        Sheridan's rear at Wilcox's landing, and captured a few of his men.</p>
                    <p>A brigade of Infantry was at once despatched to protect Sheridan's rear, and
                        the enemy was kept back till Sheridan had succeeded in crossing the river
                        with the entire train.</p>
                    <p>The Railroad is advanced five miles from City Point toward Petersburg.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday, just before the Highland Light left, heavy firing was heard in the
                        direction of Petersburg. On Saturday night the rebels made an attack on our
                        pickets about the centre of our line as they were being relieved but were
                        repulsed with little or no loss to our troops.</p>
                    <p>On the Heights beyond Petersburg the rebels have an 18 gun battery bearing
                        upon the centre of our line in front of that place. This battery has been
                        very troublesome and so far has proved too heavy for any artillery that we
                        have brought against it.</p>
                    <p>Wilson has gone on another cavalry expedition and good news from him may be
                        expected soon.</p>
                    <p>A rebel Captain and four privates came into Butler's lines on Friday and took
                        the oath of allegiance.</p>
                    <p>Two hundred rebel prisoners were at City Point yesterday morning.</p>

                    <p>H.Q. Army of the Potomac, <br>June 23--6, A.M.</p>
                    <p>Wilson's division of cavalry have moved off in the direction of the Weldon
                        Railroad. When last heard from they had reached Reim's Station, and were
                        tearing up the track.</p>
                    <p>The Second and Sixth Corps moved from their old position on the right toward
                        the Weldon Railroad.</p>
                    <p>Lee seems to have anticipated a movement by our left, and determined to turn
                        our right flank.</p>
                    <p>When near the Jerusalem Plank Road, the Second Corps was confronted by Gen.
                        Hill's Corps, and a smart engagement ensued.</p>
                    <p>A battery of the Twelfth New York Artillery was annoying the Rebels, who
                        succeeded in getting round in the flank, and charged it.</p>
                    <p>The infantry support being surprised, retired, leaving four guns in the hands
                        of the enemy; but our line of battle was soon reformed.</p>
                    <p>The men had become accustomed to Lee's new practice of acting entirely on the
                        defensive, and must have been confused by his bold assault.</p>
                    <p>Two divisions of the Fifth Corps were within easy supporting distance on the
                        right, and the Sixth was ready for any hostilities on the left.</p>
                    <p>Several charges were made by the Rebels, who suffered severely.</p>
                    <p>There was heavy firing in front of the Ninth Corps about midnight. At times
                        the musketry broke out into regular volleys. The firing lasted all night.</p>

                    <p>Maj. Holt, of the First Massachusetts, is slightly wounded.</p>
                    <p>It is reported that the Seventeenth New York battery has lost four guns by
                        being surprised.</p>
                    <p>Skirmishing was continued all last night on our left, but with what result is
                        not yet known.</p>
                    <p>The Third Excelsior Regiment, Lieut. Col. Leonard Commanding, will leave
                        here, to morrow, for home, their term of service having expired. This
                        regiment participated in all the battles of the Peninsula, under Gen.
                        McClellan,a nd with the exception of Antietam, all those in which the Army
                        of the Potomac have been engaged.</p>

                        Hundred, reports no fighting up to 10 o'clock this morning.</p>
                    <p>There is nothing later from the Whtie House, and no particulars from Sheridan
                        since his arrival there.</p>

                        Railroad From Gen. Hunter.</p>
                    <p>H.Q. Army of the Potomac, June 23.</p>
                    <p>The attack upon the Second corps on Wednesday, near the Weldon railroad, did
                        not result so disastrously as was at first supposed.</p>
                    <p>The line was formed by Barlow's division being on the left, Birney's (Gen.
                        Mott in command) on the centre, and Gibbons on the right.</p>
                    <p>It was expected that the Sixth Corps would have connected on the left with
                        Burlow, but it seems quite a gap was left, into which A.P. Hill's corps
                        entered, and before our men were aware of it they had received a volley from
                        the rear which created a panic in the ranks and caused a rapid retreat to
                        the woods in the rear of the third division.</p>
                    <p>This left the flank of the third division unprotected, and the enemy, taking
                        advantage of it, charged through and fairly late the rifle pits, ordering
                        our men to surrender.</p>
                    <p>The troops, however, left the trenches and fell back rapidly, but many of
                        them were captured and quite a number killed and wounded.</p>
                    <p>Our loss in prisoners is reported at about 1,000 while some make the figure
                        higher. Our loss in killed and wounded is probably 1,500.</p>
                    <p>Four officers engaged in this fight had just joined their commands after
                        being exchanged, and when surrounded and ordered to surrender replied,
                        "Never! death rather than Libby!" and fighting their way as best they could,
                        several of them got back safe.</p>
                    <p>At 8 p.m., a change was made by the 2d corps and the line of works from which
                        they had been forced in the afternoon recovered.</p>
                    <p>We lost scarcely a man in this advance, as the enemy fired too high and the
                        balls all passed over the heads of our men.</p>
                    <p>A number of prisoners were taken.</p>
                    <p>Skirmishing was kept up all night along the line, the pickets being at some
                        points not more than 50 yards apart.</p>
                    <p>At daylight this morning an advance of the entire line was made, when it was
                        found the enemy had taken a new position, some distance further back, where
                        they had thrown up strong entrenchments during the night, which they still
                        hold.</p>
                    <p>Col. Blaisdell, 11th Mass., was killed today by a sharpshooter while visiting
                        the skirmish line.</p>
                    <p>W. H. Child of the 45th Pennsylvania regiment, who was but a few days ago
                        promoted from Sergeant Major of the regiment, to Lieutenant of Co. F. of the
                        same, was shot dead by a rebel sharpshooter on Tuesday evening.</p>
                    <p>The 6th Corps moved towards the railroad this morning, driving the enemy
                        before them and during the afternoon reported that they were in possession
                        of the road, and arrangements were at once made to destroy it.</p>
                    <p>At 5 p.m., a large force of the enemy were seen moving towards the the [sic]
                        front as if to resist the advance of the 6th corps. An engagement in that
                        direction is expected tonight.</p>
                    <p>June 24--5 P.M.--Nothing but picket firing took place during the evening or
                        night, and very little is going on this morning.</p>
                    <p>From Gen. Hunter's Command.</p>
                    <p>The War Department today received information from Gen. Hunter's command,
                        which, having fulfilled the mission on which it was sent, (the destruction
                        of the Central railroad in the vicinity of Stanton, and the Gordonville and
                        Lynchburg railroad and an important portion of the James River canal.) is
                        successfully pressing forward to the point in Western Virginia, to which it
                        was ordered.</p>
