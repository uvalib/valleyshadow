<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Convention relative to the proposed amendment to the National
                        Constitution, acknowledging God, continued its sessions in the West Arch
                        Street Presbyterian Church. The attendance was large. Rev. Dr. Edwards
                        presided.</p>
                    <p>Letters from Hon. B. Gratz Brown of Missouri, Prof. J.F. Winkler of Buffalo,
                        Rev. L. W. Habil of Wisconsin, Rev. Dr. Durfield of Detroit, and others,
                        favoring the movement were read.</p>
                    <p>Revs. A.M. Whitstone, A.C. Todd, James McDonald, Prof. McIlvaine, and others
                        delivered addresses upon the doings of auxiliary societies formed in various
                        States.</p>
                    <p>A session was held during the afternoon, and a number of addresses on the
                        subject were made.</p>
                    <p>In the evening, Dr. Edwards called the meeting to order; when the following
                        resolutions were adopted:</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That a national recognition of God, the
                        Lord Jesus Christ and the Holy Scriptures, as proposed in the memorial of
                        this Association to Congress, is clearly a Scriptural duty which it is
                        national peril to disregard.</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That in consideration of the general
                        diffusion of religious intelligence, principles and institutions throughout
                        our country; in view of the many express recognitions of Christianity by the
                        Constitutions, and the legislative enactments of the several States, and in
                        view also, of the religious history of the founding of this Government, it
                        is a striking and solemn fact that our present National Constitution is so
                        devoid of any distinctive Christian feature that one of our Chief
                        Magistrates once refused to appoint a day of fasting and prayer in an hour
                        of public calamity because the nation in its Constitution recognized no God
                        and another, in contracting a treaty with a Mahomedan Power, hesitated not
                        to declare that the Government of the United States is not in any sense
                        founded on the Christian religion. It has in itself no character of enmity
                        against the laws and religion of Mussulmen.</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That the measures proposed by this
                        Association are not sectional nor sectarian, nor partisan, but the general
                        voice of Christian patriotism, asking that which is right and wholesome,
                        which is keeping with our antecedents, and which will not operate
                        oppressively upon the conscience of any citizen.</p>
                    <p>Resolved, that the state of the times, recent and
                        present, and the state of pu[b]lic sentiment, warrant and encourage the
                        attempt to secure the amendment of the Constitution which is proposed by
                        this Association.</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That the hour of chastisement is the
                        hour of repentance, amendment and reform, and that in such a day of national
                        trouble and rebuke as has befallen us, every reformation from sin is
                        valuable and important; it is clear that in acknowledging God, in exalting
                        His Son and in diffusing the principles of His word through all our
                        Government and Administration, not only is there no mistake committed, but
                        an end of the first dignity and importance is secured.</p>
                    <p>The convention adjourned with prayer.</p>

                    <p>Under this caption the Newville Star of the Valley
                        remarks:</p>
                    <p>The children of our town have fallen into a confirmed habit of flocking in a
                        body to any house in which a death has occurred, for the purpose of gazing
                        upon the remains. At such a time the grief of survivors in a family from
                        which a loved one has been taken is too sacred for such rude intrusion, and
                        parents should see that their children are not permitted to make these
                        untimely visits.</p>
                    <p>The above applies with equal force to our own community. No death can occur
                        without crowds of rude ill-mannered children rushing into the house
                        containing the corpse, to the annoyance of relatives and friends. The
                        nuisance has become almost intolerable and some of our citizens on the
                        occasion of a death in the family, have been compelled to lock their doors
                        in order to keep out these rude intruders.</p>
