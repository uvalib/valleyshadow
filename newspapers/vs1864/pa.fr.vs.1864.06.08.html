<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Her Experience as a Spy in Dixie. <br>She meets the Rebel Generals Forrest,
                        Bragg, Hoone and Morgan. <br>Captured and Condemned to Death. <br>She is
                        Recaptured by our Troops and made a Major in the U.S. Service.</p>
                    <p>[From the New York World.]</p>
                    <p>We have now among us one of these heroic women whose glorious courage and
                        unflinching personal sacrifices have given a tinge of the olden time romance
                        to the somber annals of our terrible civil war. There arrived yesterday at
                        the Astor House, where she will remain for a few days, Miss Major Pauline
                        Cushman, the gallant and true-hearted girl, with whose exploits the country
                        North and South has been ringing for a year past. She has come among us on
                        her way to the farther recesses of our cool and salubrious climate in
                        pursuit of relaxation of her health from the wounds and fatigues to which
                        she has been subjected. A full narrative of all her "hair-breadth escapes
                        and ventures perilous" since she entered the secret service of the Union
                        would furnish forth a bulky volume, surpassing by far the real interest of
                        the most ingenious and highly wrought fictions of the day. Of course we can
                        tarry for only a brief narration of a few of the more striking incidents of
                        her career.</p>
                    <p>Her History,</p>
                    <p>since the war began, commences at Cleveland Ohio, where she was residing when
                        hostilities commenced in 1861.</p>
                    <p>Of mingled French and Spanish, descent, and a native of New Orleans, where
                        she first saw the light in 1863, she brought to the profession of the stage
                        all the fire and vivacity of her lineage and climes; and soon became by her
                        talents as well as the graces of her person, exceedingly popular. From
                        Cleveland, at an early period of the war, she removed to Louisville,
                        Kentucky, and there her histrionic success continued. Among her many
                        acquaintances and friends were some paroled confederate officers who, during
                        her engagements at Wood's theatre, in March 1863, were very attentive, and
                        presumed at length so far upon her courtesy as to ask her to offer upon the
                        stage during the performance of "The Seven Sisters," the following toast:
                        "Here is to Jeff Davis and the Southern Confederacy. May the South always
                        maintain her honor and her rights." Shocked in her patriotic feelings by
                        this proposal, she at once privately acquainted Col. Moore the provost
                        marshal who, after some serious conversation, held out such inducements as
                        persuaded her to enter the secret service of the Union. This being
                        understood upon a giving night offered the toast in question with full
                        advice and consent of the authorities. The theatre was crowed, and the
                        incident fell upon the multitude like a thunder clap, confusing and
                        mortifying all loyal persons present, and highly delighting their "secesh"
                        neighbors. This, of course, led to her mock arrest and dismissal from the
                        theatre. Speedily released, she next repaired to Nashville, and while there
                        engaged at the new theatre, it was suggested to her by Col. W. Truesdale,
                        the chief of army police, to make a little excursion to the headquarters of
                        the Confederate General Bragg. This idea fully coinciding with her own
                        innate love of wild and dashing adventures, and an excellent pretext being
                        available in the fact that she had a brother in the rebel service, she
                        willingly undertook the expedition, after having solemnly accepted the
                        following oath:</p>
                    <p>United States of America, <br>Dep't. of the Cumberland, <br>Office Chief of
                        Army Police, <br>May 26, 1863.</p>
                    <p>I, Pauline Cushman, do sol[e]mnly swear that I will bear true allegiance and
                        fidelity to the Government of the United States of America, and that I will
                        faithfully serve the same during the time that I am employed in the service
                        of the Army of the Cumberland, to the best of my knowledge and ability; that
                        I will observe and obey all the instructions which may be given me; that I
                        will in no manner or form convey or give any information to the enemies of
                        the Government of the United States which will be of advantage to them or
                        injury to the Federal cause, so help me God.</p>
                    <p>The Colonel then gave her a series of very minute, solemn and impressive
                        instructions for her guidance, and she set forth as a refugee and victim of
                        "northern tyranny."</p>
                    <p>She Is Caught At Last.</p>
                    <p>All good as well as evil fortune must one day take a turn, and at length, in
                        the very plenitude of her renown, the fair and brave Pauline was taken in
                        the dead of night by rebel scouts, while she was resting at the house of one
                        Baum, a farmer residing near the Hardin turnpike road, which she had been
                        exploring after the capture of Nashville by the Union forces, her purpose
                        being to ascertain the position and strength of the enemy after their
                        retreat from that city.</p>
                    <p>John Morgan,</p>
                    <p>or as she calls him, "Johnnie Morgan," the renowned guerrilla chieftain,
                        became her first custodian and conducted her to the quarters of General
                        Forrest. On the way "Johnnie" manifested all the gallantry that usually
                        distinguishes the genuine son of Mars in the presence of the fair and
                        offered the beautiful Pauline all his friendship, a magnificent diamond ring
                        and a silver mounted revolver as keepsakes and urged her to become his aid
                        de camp so soon as she should be released.</p>
                    <p>Her Interview with Gen. Forrest</p>
                    <p>was dramatic in a high degree. The General was not little pleased to see her
                        in his camp and greeted her with unfeigned warmth:</p>
                    <p>"Well, I'm really glad to see you," said he, "I've been looking for you a
                        long time but I have got this last shuffle" (the General still retained the
                        phraseology of his profession before the war) "and I intend to hold you. You
                        have been here before--you know all the roads, bridle paths and bog paths,
                        even in the country." While finely assumed indignation, our heroine
                        exclaimed, "Tis false! I've never been here before, and I should like to
                        send a bullet through the man mean enough to make the charge."</p>
                    <p>Forrest gazed at her with amazement, while she continued:</p>
                    <p>"Yes, and I'd send one through you if I could, if you dared to repeat the
                        assertion!"</p>
                    <p>He looked at her for a moment in silence, and then replied:</p>
                    <p>"Well! your'e [sic] made of good fighting stuff, if you are a woman. I got my
                        visit South as a poor refugee expelled from the Union lines on account of
                        her strong Southern feeling, and accounted most adroitly for the absence of
                        her baggage, stating that she had been deprived of all by Col. Truesdale.
                        The General questioned her as to her plans for the future in the South, the
                        position and resources of the Union army, &amp;c., and all those
                        inquiries she managed skillfully to meet with woman's ready with. At length
                        he summarily informed her that he should hand her over to his Provost
                        Marshal General, Col. M'Kinstry--"a humane and just man"--who would
                        investigate the serious charges against her, and according the truth decide.</p>
                    <p>After a little more bandying of words on both sides, Pauline still stoutly
                        maintaining her confederate loyalty, she was
                        dispatched to General Bragg's headquarters at Shelbyville, receiving, as she
                        parted from "Johnnie Morgan," his good wishes, expressed in the following
                        touching language:</p>
                    <p>"Good-bye! I hope we shall meet again where we can have something better than
                        corn bread, baked in ashes, and rot gut whiskey at fifte[e]n dollars per
                        quart!" Her parting song, as she rode away, was "Trust to luck." By a
                        curious coincidence, when she next saw the redoubtable Morgan, it was in
                        prison at Columbus, and in his convict garb, while she was then again free
                        and within the circle of Federal authority. Advancing to him she laughingly
                        exclaimed, as she held out her hand:</p>
                    <p>"How are you, Johnnie?"</p>
                    <p>"Ah! replied he, the boot is on the other foot now!"</p>
                    <p>A Quaint Interview With Gen. Braxton Bragg</p>
                    <p>was the result of her visit to Shelbyville.</p>
                    <p>Having been conducted to the General's tent, her coloquy with that important
                        personage thus began:</p>
                    <p>Bragg--Of what country are you? <br>Pauline--I am of French and Spanish
                        descent. <br>Bragg--Where were you born? <br>Pauline--In New Orleans.
                        <br>Bragg--Your speech savors of the Yankee twang. <br>Pauline--Well, as
                        an actress, I have been playing Yankee parts so long that I suppose I've
                        caught the "twang."</p>
                    <p>She then went on to narrate the history of her fighting qualities from a
                        woman--my own good, brave mother.</p>
                    <p>"But to the point. You have important papers in your possession, and if they
                        prove you to be a spy nothing can save you from a little hemp."</p>
                    <p>She carelessly replied: "Well, go on and root the whole thing up, if you
                        like."</p>
                    <p>Then picking up a packet of letters, he in turn said: <br>"Without sending
                        spies, I know everything that goes on at the
                        Yankee headquarters better than their own clerks there!" <br>Pauline--But
                        if I am found guilty what will you do with me? <br>Bragg--You will surely
                        be hanged. <br>Pauline--General, come, now! I don't think I'd be either
                        useful or ornamental dangling at the end of a rope. If I must die let me
                        choose the method of my death. <br>Bragg--I cannot promise that, because
                        you might prefer a natural mode of exit. <br>Pauline--No; if I must perish
                        let me be shot, for that would not hurt me so much.</p>
                    <p>Shortly after this highly consolatory interview, Miss Pauline was taken
                        exceedingly ill, and having been found guilty and condemned, was saved from
                        death by this circumstance alone. It was only after three months' captivity
                        that, one fine morning, while she still lay upon her sick bed, the joyous
                        sound of the Union bugles as the rebels fled and the Federals under Generals
                        Gordon, Granger, Mitchell, and Stanley entered the town, recalled her to
                        liberty and life. After this it was that General Garfield in recognition of
                        her long and most invaluable services and her sufferings in two severe
                        wounds received from the enemies of the Union while she was on duty, that
                        General Garfield conferred upon her the rank and title of Major by which she
                        is now universally known.</p>
                    <p>New Personal Appearance.</p>
                    <p>The fair "spy" whose name has already become historical, possesses, many
                        personal graces. Rather above the medium height, her figure is fully
                        rounded, yet agile and elastic; and a high brow of classic contour is adorned with clustering tresses of rich
                        dark hair, and a comely waist and feminine hand and foot subdue all the
                        ruder associations of the camp and field; and the ensemble of the thoughts awakened, as this lady stands before
                        you, and, in glowing phrase, recounts her own strange story, is bewildering
                        yet fascinating in the extreme, seeming rather some romance of the days Joan
                        of Arc than a reality of our own less golden time.</p>
                    <p>Miss Major Cushman has with her the various
                        passes, uniforms, etc., used by her, and will probably be visited during her
                        brief stay by thousands of her grateful country-men. It is rumored that
                        to-night a grand serenade will testify in patriotic melodies the
                        appreciation of very many personal friends who admire in her the true woman
                        and the tried and trusty patriot.</p>
