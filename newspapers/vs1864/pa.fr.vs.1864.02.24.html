<b>A Republican Panegyric on the Confederate Constitution</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The writer observes a recent article in the Times wherein that paper
                    examined the Confederate Constitution and found several aspects of it
                    admirable--specifically, those strengthening executive power, and those
                    providing for a longer term for the president. As the Times is a Republican
                    paper, the writer assumes that it is part of an effort to convince the public
                    that an election during the war would be dangerous. This is yet another sign
                    that Republicans hope to extend Lincoln's term by extraconstitutional means.<br>

<b>Are Negroes Descendants of Ham?</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A three-column reply to a letter written several weeks previously, by
                    correspondent "C," who argued against assertions in the Spirit and Times that
                    black people were the descendants of Ham and under the curse of Canaan. The
                    editors first question the writer's attempt to historicize the interpretation of
                    the biblical stories, and then move on to attempt to prove the connection
                    between the biblical stories and contemporary black people.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A correspondent, over the signature of "C," in our issue of week before last,
                        accuses us of falling into the "groundless and vulgar error" of supposing
                        the Afrcan race to be descendants of Canaan or Ham, and consequently
                        included in the prophecy of Noah, when he "awoke from his wine." The
                        argument by which he attempts to refute this "vulgar error" deserves credit
                        for its ingenuity, but beyond its ingenuity has little else to recommend it.
                        The very basis upon which it rests is fallacious. The writer asserts that,
                        "No true solution (of the question) can be attained without a careful
                        consideration of the relations of enmity existing between the people of
                        Israel and the Canaanites when this Scripture was
                            written." What bearing the state of affairs existing at the time
                        "this Scripture was written" can have upon the interpretation of the
                        prophecy, we are unable to see. Moses merely recorded the prophecy, which was uttered by Noah long ages before
                        the inspired writer was born. Moses is simply writing history--simply
                        recording what was said and done almost a thousand years before--and must we
                        not look for the true solution of the prophecy in the state of affairs
                        existing, not in the times in which the historian lived, but in the time
                        when the facts transpired and the prophecies were uttered which that
                        historian records? Let us illustrate our meaning by an example from profane
                        history. We find it recorded in a recently published volume of American
                        history that the Father of his Country, in his farewell address, warned his
                        fellow-citizens against the evil of sectionalism, which he predicted would
                        sever the Union. We cannot speak of the prediction as being made under the
                        facts and influences which existed when it was recorded by the
                        historian--the States discordant and belligerent--the land drenched in
                        fraternal blood. No, it stands sublimely by itself, in the mighty past, as
                        the almost prophetic utterance of the purest patriot and greatest statesman
                        of the age and nation. So does the prophecy of Noah; and it matters nothing
                        what influences may have operated upon the mind of the inspired writer when
                        he recorded it. The inimical relations between Canaan and Israel, in the
                        time of Moses, have much less to do with the interpretation of this passage,
                        than those same relations in the time of Joshua, when the Gibeonites, the
                        descendants of Canaan, were made hewers of wood and drawers of water for the
                        congregation of Israel, and thus this prophecy, to a limited extent, was
                        fulfilled in their enslavement. To approach a true solution of the prophecy
                        on this basis, we must take our stand with Noah and not with Moses--with
                        Noah as he stands in his hoary-headed majesty as the father of postdiluvian
                        man, and looks down through the vista of coming centuries, tracing the
                        development of the races sprung from his loins, through all the ceaseless
                        changes of the world's history.</p>
                    <p>In another respect the groundwork of "C"s argument is fallacious. He tells
                        us, "No interpretation (of this passage) can be admitted by reflecting men,
                        which makes the curse upon Canaan to be the immediate consequence of the conduct of Ham." While we admit that the
                        curse is not the immediate consequence of the
                        conduct of Ham, yet we contend that "C" entirely loses sight of the true
                        connection between the narrative and the prophecy itself. He regards the
                        events detailed as merely the occasion on which
                        the prophecy was uttered. We maintain that there is a typical relation
                        between the narrative and the prophecy, which renders it necessary that they
                        should correspond with each other. We can illustrate our meaning by
                        reference to a similar case in the Scriptures, where King Joash smites the
                        ground with his arrows, at the bidding of the Prophet Elisha [2 Kings 13;
                        15-19]. As many times as he should thus smite the ground, so many times was
                        he to overcome the Syrians. He smote it but thrice, "and the man of God was
                        wroth with him and said thou shouldst have smitten five or six times; then
                        hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed it." No one would pretend
                        that the future defeats of the Syrians were smitten out thrice, because the king smote but thrice. So in the case
                        under consideration. The narrative and the prophecy are so closely related
                        as to be mutually dependant [sic] upon each other. The facts recorded
                        previously just suit the prophecy; and had the prophecy been of a different
                        character, we are compelled to believe that Providence would have provided a
                        different state of facts. That this is the true theory of interpretation is
                        evident because Moses relates the facts as the introduction to the prophecy;
                        because the three sons of Noah who appear in the narrative appear again in the prophecy--two of them in proper person and the third in the person
                        of his son Canaan, a change which Moses leads us to expect by previously
                        announcing that Ham was "the father of Canaan" who is mentioned in the
                        prophecy; and lastly because those who behaved righteously, as recorded in
                        the narrative, were blessed in the prophecy, and those whose sins are recorded in the
                            narrative are cursed in the prophecy. Surely, then, though the curse of Canaan
                        is not the immediate consequence of the conduct
                        of Ham, yet there is an inseparable connection between the narrative and the
                        prophecy, which compels us to take them together, if we would arrive at a
                        correct understanding of the whole passage. But this is just what our
                        correspondent don't [sic] wish to do, because it will not serve his purpose.
                        He must isolate Canaan from all his surroundings, and argue as if the
                        preceding verses were blotted from the Bible; though in doing so he violates
                        every known rule of interpretation in Law, Science or Scripture.</p>
                    <p>From these false premises "C" builds his argument. We might be content to
                        stop here, for when the foundation gives away the whole superstructure must
                        tumble. Yet it shall be our purpose to show that this curse was pronounced
                        upon all the descendants of Ham, that the
                        descendants of Ham did people the continent of Africa, and that in them, and
                        in no other people on the earth, this curse has been and is being fulfilled
                        even down to the present day.</p>
                    <p>The inspired writer evidently designs to explain the occurrence of the name
                        of Canaan, by previously stating that Ham was "the
                            father of Canaan," thus showing that he regarded the latter as
                        the representative of his father. A number of the most able commentators,
                        amongst them Hengstenberg, hold that Canaan was the eldest son of Ham,
                        though mentioned last in the list of sons, for the sake of convenience; just
                        as Japheth, the eldest son of Noah is always mentioned last, though at
                        Noah's death he became the head of the whole family, and is called Japheth
                        "the elder." So here, Canaan, the eldest son, is the representative of his
                        father. This same view is suggested by the words of the prophecy, "cursed be
                        Canaan, a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren." Canaan's
                        brethren were Mizraim, Cush, and Phut, and it is clearly established by
                        history that neither he nor his descendants became the servants of his
                        brethren; while it is just as clearly established that the descendants of
                        Ham, including Canaan, did become subject to the
                        descendants of his brethren Shem and Japheth. The
                        prophecy, moreover, says, of both Shem and Japheth, "Canaan shall be his
                        servant." Both passages taken togehter would read, "cursed by Canaan, a
                        servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren Shem and Japheth." But Canaan is not the brother of Sham and Japheth,
                        and can only be considered so when standing in the place of his father. He
                        must therefore represent his father in this prophetic view of the future
                        history of the three great families of the human race, and through him the
                        curse must have passed from all the descendants of Ham. There is extant an
                        Arabic version of the Scriptures, which renders this passage "Cursed be Ham
                        the father of Canaan." Bishop Newton, in his work on the Prophecies, says
                        "If we regard the metre, this line 'cursed by Canaan' (the ancient Hebrew
                        being written in metre) is much shorter than the rest, as if something was
                        deficient. May we not suppose therefore that the copyist wrote by mistake
                        only Canaan, instaed of Ham
                            the father of Canaan?" There are other arguments to prove that
                        the curse was pronounced upon all the descendants of Ham, but our space will
                        not admit of them.</p>
                    <p>Having thus shown that the curse had reference to all the descendants of Ham,
                        we now proceed to prove that the Africans were the descendants of Ham, we
                        now proceed to prove that the Africans were the descendants of Ham, and that
                        the curse applies to them. The very name of Ham signifies "the blackish one"
                        and it is used in the Scriptures, a number of times, as synonymous with
                        Ethiopia. The descendants of Cush, the first mentioned son of Ham, emigrated
                        to Assyria and Arabia, and founded a kingdom in Meroe, now called Abyssinia.
                        The Rev. Dr. Alexander says the kingdom of Cush, ****</p>

<b>Military Damages</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors note the supplement to the act passed last session in the state
                    legislature to provide compensation for damages incurred during the Confederate
                    raid in 1862. The addition, proposed by Mr. Sharpe, would include all incursions
                    of the enemy into the state, and would also cover damages sustained from the
                    occupation by state militia forces. Those who suffered losses due to occupation
                    of their land or supplying troops will be given certificates of indebtedness
                    bearing four percent interest, redeemable in twenty years or sooner at the
                    option of the state; those who lost horses or other property taken by the
                    Confederates will receive certificates of redemption that will be funded by a
                    special tax of one-fourth mil on the dollar. The editors urge representatives
                    from counties not invaded to consider the bill favorably.<br>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Republicans, note the writer, have begun to act under the assumption
                    that the Confederates have no rights under the Constitution. Now, it would be
                    impertinent for Confederates to try to claim Constitutional rights, as they
                    reject the Constitution in other ways, but for Republicans to deny the
                    Confederates the privileges of the Constitution implies that they release them
                    from its obligations as well. The editors compare it to a Christian claiming
                    that an infidel cannot claim treatment as a Christian since he does not live by
                    those laws, but it does not mean that they would not treat this infidel without
                    Christian obligation.<br>

<b>The Veterans and Local Bounties</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Provost Marshal General, in reply to an inquiry from the Provost

                    as they see no reason that veterans should be denied the "liberal local
                    bounties" being offered, and they believe the effect of the opinion will be to
