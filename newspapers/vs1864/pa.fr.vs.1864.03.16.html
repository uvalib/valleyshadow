<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Men shrink, says the Journal of Commerce, from
                        looking into the future. They find fault with those who insist on
                        questioning the effect of present policy on the nation's destiny. The
                        rebellion must be put down. To this all agree; but what then? This question
                        is [illegible] ill-timed--copperish--disloyal. The voice of the dominant
                        party overpowers the voice of the earnest lover of this country, who asks
                        anxiously what is to follow the suppression of the rebellion? "What business
                        is it of ours now?" they say--what right have you to interrupt the work of
                        crushing the rebellion by suggesting that there is any other question?"</p>
                    <p>The rebellion is a terrible curse--a grand evil--a huge crime. It must be got
                        rid of.--But there are other curses, other evils, other crimes. A disease in
                        the human body is a great evil. But the Physician is a murderer who directs
                        his whole skill to suppressing the disease, and pays no attention to the
                        preservation of the constitution. Many diseases might be suddenly and wholly
                        driven out of the system by doses of arsenic. Many a terrible swelling or
                        tumor might be eradicated by a free use of the knife, but the blood and the
                        life might follow the knife. Fevers might be cured by remedies that would
                        bring bodily weakness and certain death soon afterward.--Shall we crush a
                        rebellion in such a way as to destroy the vital system, when it can be done
                        otherwise? Shall we carry on this war so as to come out of it weakened,
                        impoverished, with a terrible load of debt and a terrible load of sectional
                        hatred and bitterness, and without that compact, hearty, healthy condition
                        of the nation which is necessary to enable us to recover even ordinary
                        strength? The life blood of our country is the affection of the people for
                        the Union; and if this affection fails, blood fails, and the body dies.
                        Temporary alienation may be cured, but if we seek to cure it by means
                        calculated to make the alienation permanent, we are not likely to benefit
                        the system by our experiment. The work can be accomplished without this
                        result. Why not be wise in time?</p>
                    <p>Men may seek to stifle these questions, but they are seizing fast hold on the
                        minds of the people. It is plain as the noonday sun that if the policy of
                        the present administration is continued into another four years, we have
                        seen the end of the American Union. Mr. Lincoln and his advisers can never
                        restore that Union to life and health, nor can they build up a new
                        Constitution to replace that which they are destroying. They cannot save the
                        life or the nation. If we are to trust to them, it may as well be confessed
                        to-day, as it certainly will be confessed next year, that the old Union is
                        gone, and forever, and that their new government will be a weak and
                        worthless experiment. Why close our eyes to these solemn truths?--The
                        principle of wholesale abolition and confiscation, founded on the idea of
                        conquering and govering[ sic] as a conquered people millions of Americans,
                        is contrary to the spirit of free institutions. It is poison in the blood of
                        the Union. It is death to republican government. The one-tenth plan of Mr.
                        Lincoln, by which one man is to govern nine, and one tenth of the population
                        are to elect representatives, electors, legislators and governors for the
                        whole population, wielding the old power of the whole, as if all were
                        acting--this plan is in direct violation of American principles and of moral
                        right. It is directly hostile to the constitutional guarantee of republican
                        forms of government. At best the one-tenth ought not to elect more than
                        one-tenth of the representatives--ought not to be wielding the power of more
                        than one-tenth the population. How would free principles survive the shock
                        of beholding one tenth of the population of Virginia balancing, in the House
                        of Representatives, the votes of five Northern States, and ten times their
                        number of Northern voter [sic]? The idea is not only absurd, but it is a
                        deadly thrust at the whole fabric of our government! But what if that be
                        permitted, and the one tenth do make a new State Constitution for the
                        nine-tenths, as the absolute, incontrovertible law of the State, are those
                        nine-tenths ever likely to be cheerful lovers of the Union? It is useless to
                        discuss this plan. It is too plainly contrary to the fundamental principles
                        of our government to commend the respect even of the most devoted followers
                        of those who invented it.</p>
                    <p>What sort of a free government will the United States be when re-constructed
                        on this plan? New York, with her millions of freemen, will find herself
                        out-voted and out-weighed in both houses of Congress by other States with
                        one-tenth of her own numbers; and that tenth will be partly or wholly negro,
                        if the dominant party carry out consistently its present avowed policy! Does
                        any one imagine that that will be a Union which North-men or Southern men
                        will love, will cling to, will fight for? Was it such a Union as that, for
                        which we have poured out treasures of money and life to save?</p>
                    <p>How will such a Union pay the interest on thousands of millions of debt? How
                        pay the debt?</p>
                    <p>If the present policy is pursued, the war will last for years, and only
                        terminate in an armed occupation, equivalent to a constant war, with
                        expenses annually footing up hundreds of millions. We want no unwilling
                        union, no mere conquered submission, to carry out such a debt as ours will
                        be. We must have a cordial, hearty, willing union, or we are bankrupt,
                        ruined. Our nation, united willingly, can carry more debt than any other
                        people, and can pay it. Our nation, pacified by the confiscation of Southern
                        property, the extirpation or disfranchisement of Southern men, cannot carry
                        that debt. The first element of doubt and danger will be the existence of
                        States unpledged to pay the debt, and mortgaged to act only by one-tenth of
                        their people. The future is big with other forms of discord, with other
                        elements of national disease, and if the union be not healthy and willing,
                        they will break out as ulcers here and there.</p>
                    <p>It is in vain to close our eyes on these truths. The rebellion must be put
                        down, but it must be put down in such a way as to leave the nation with
                        vitality, energy, and hope. Under the present policy, there is no future of
                        union. A new government, a new constitution, a new form of union, a new
                        principle of unity--all these go into the radical calculation, but all these
                        fail to show anything but a wreck of the old American Union in the radical
                        view of the future. Men of American, rouse yourselves to the truths we have
                        set before you! Awake before it is too late! The opportunity to return to
                        the safe policy is before us in the coming election. Let us go back. Let us
                        present to the vast population of the South the old Union and old
                        Constitution for their acceptance, with the rights of the States unimpaired.
                        Let the principles of the Crittenden Resolutions be studied carefully and
                        adopted heartily. The present disease of the nation is rebellion. Let that
                        disease be eradicated without introducing new forms of internal suffering
                        and complaint. Let us act as millions of men talking to millions of men
                        should act if they would exercise ordinary common sense based on the
                        experience of nations in all the centuries.</p>
                    <p>Our of this terrible strait the nation may be brought, free, ennobled,
                        strong, to resume her old pathway of glory and beneficence. Rebellion will
                        have received a lesson which will prevent its hideous form from again rising
                        for a century, either in New England or the South. But if we go on as now,
                        the very principles established will be in favor of new rebellions whenever
                        any part of the people become insane over some fanatical notion of
                    reform.</p>
