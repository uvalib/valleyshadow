                    in this crisis as the character of Washington qualified him for the great part
                    for which he was destined in achieving our independence."</excerpt>
                <transcript>
                    <p>In the hurry and confusion incident to refitting an office and getting under
                        way again, we are unable to speak at length, in this issue of our paper, of
                        the nominees of the Chicago Convention. We have only to say that the action
                        of that Convention has inspired the people with renewed confidence in the
                        stability of our institutions and sent a thrill of joy and patriotic hope to
                        the heart of every true friend of Constitutional Government, and the Union
                        as our fathers made it.</p>
                    <p>In the absence of anything which, under other circumstances, we might have
                        written, we submit the following articles, on the candidates and platform,
                        from the New York <emph rend="italic">World</emph>, which meet our most
                        hearty endorsement:</p>
                    <p>The Union Candidates.</p>
                    <p>The National Democratic Convention has done its work, and done it well. It
                        has nominated the ablest and most popular ticket ever presented for the
                        suffrages of the American people. Both candidates are in the early prime of
                        vigorous manhood; both are men of such decided power that they made their
                        mark as soon as they were called to act in a public capacity; both are, by
                        instincts and education, gentlemen; neither is old enough to have become
                        incrusted with prejudices which unfit him for playing a useful part in new
                        circumstances or to have surrounded himself with a set of party hacks who
                        will prevent his discerning merit or ability out of their own circle.</p>
                    <p>The nomination of General George B. McClellan for President of the United
                        States is a sure augury of triumph in the election, and success in restoring
                        the Union. The personal qualifications which General McClellan brings to the
                        arduous task for which he has been selected are of a very high order. A mind
                        equally comprehensive and vigorous; a robust, decisive will; a soldier's
                        sense of honor; inflexible integrity; far-reaching sagacity which, on a
                        great subject or a great occasion, has never been at fault; generous warmth
                        of disposition which wins hosts of friends; purity of private character
                        which even the envenomed breath of slander has been compelled to respect;
                        love of country and reverence for the Constitution which were never exceeded
                        in the earlier days of the republic; and a native elevation of character
                        which cannot descend to crooked ways and scorns demagogic arts, this is the
                        assemblage of traits which in General McClellan make up one of the most
                        efficient and best-balanced characters ever called to act on a public stage.
                        His extraordinary combination of solid with popular qualities, of military
                        capacity with civil aptitudes of the generosity of early with the wisdom of
                        later manhood, of fitness for the highest office with availability as a
                        candidate, qualifies him as preeminently for his allotted part in this
                        crisis as the character of Washington qualified <emph rend="italic"
                        >him</emph> for the great part for which he was destined in achieving our
                        independence, and will give to "The Savior of the Union" a place in our
                        history second only to that of "The Father of his Country."</p>
                    <p>"Thou didst begin the quarrel," said an ancient sage, "but I the
                        reconciliation." The election of Abraham Lincoln was a trumpet of sedition
                        and civil war; that of George B. McClellan will be the herald of reunion and
                        peace. The people understand this without argument; and the nomination made
                        yesterday will be hailed throughout the loyal states with a spontaneous
                        fervor of hopeful enthusiasm such as never before greeted the announcement
                        of a presidential candidate. General McClellan's election will be welcomed
                        by outpourings of popular gratitude and demonstrations of public rejoicing,
                        which will be the precursor and exemplar of those that will soon follow to
                        celebrate the return of peace. Peace will then be at hand, for the simple
                        reason that, after his inauguration, the character of the war will have so
                        changed that the southern people will no longer have a sufficient motive to
                        stand out. They will then see that submission to the Union does not involve
                        the overthrow of their institutions, the destruction of their property,
                        industrial disorganization, social chaos, negro equality, and the nameless
                        horrors of a servile war. They now feel that they are fighting, not only as
                        every invaded people are said to fight, <emph rend="italic">pro aris et
                            focis</emph>, but that, owing to the peculiar organization of their
                        society, no other people ever had much at stake either in the sanctity of
                        their homes or the preservation of their property.</p>
                    <p>The property of other invaded peoples can only be destroyed; theirs can be
                        converted into instruments of wholesale arson, rape, and murder, making
                        men's most terrible foes those of their own households. It is by appeals
                        resting on these considerations that the rebel leaders have been able to
                        stimulate the southern people to a stretch of sacrifice and endurance such
                        as the world has seldom witnessed. These appeals have been irresistible
                        because the danger was felt to be real. On the election of General
                        McClellan, the overstrained energies of the South will relax; with relief
                        from impending danger there will supervene a general lassitude and
                        prostration; and a peace party will spring up, as if by magic, in every part
                        of the South. In their strong yearnings for peace, the door will easily be
                        opened for reconstruction on terms consistent with the honor of the
                        government.</p>
                    <p>The nomination of Hon. George H. Pendleton for Vice-President of the United
                        States, is a deserved recognition of the merit, patriotism, and fidelity of
                        an able and a rising statesman. Though not quite forty years of age, there
                        are few men in public life in this country who have given better proofs of
                        political sagacity and a clear comprehension of the necessities of the
                        country than Mr. Pendleton. He is principally known to the country as a
                        distinguished lawyer and a member of Congress, in which he represents one of
                        the Cincinnati districts. He is a powerful debater, who bears himself with a
                        decorum and courtesy which command the respect even of political opponents,
                        and which fit him to preside in the Senate with dignity and acceptance.</p>
                    <p>Since receiving intelligence of the nominations this city is all alive with
                        enthusiasm. So far as we can judge, the effect is likely to be equally
                        electric in every city, town, and hamlet in the loyal states, and, if its
                        exhibition would be allowed, in every corps, division, brigade, and regiment
                        of the loyal armies, and among the weary, suffering, patriot captives held
                        as prisoners of war by the rebels.</p>

                    <p>During the past two weeks enlisting has been going on very briskly. The
                        neighborhood of the Provost Marshal's office presented a lively scene from
                        morning till night. Committees from the different sub-districts of the
                        county were present prepared to offer large bounties and to plank down the
                        "greenbacks," and were very successful in getting men. We learn that St.
                        Thomas, Peters, Guilford, and a number of other districts have their quotas
                        already filled, whilst, committees of other districts are actively at work
                        with every prospect of success in getting a sufficient number of men in time
                        to avoid the draft.</p>
                    <p>The draft has been postponed for home time, and from the exertions made to
                        get volunteers, we think there will be no necessity for a draft in the
                        county.</p>

                    <p>This gallant regiment has suffered very severely in the recent battles on the
                        Weldon railroad. At one time the entire regiment was within the enemy's
                        lines, but owing to the density of the thicket in which the battle was
                        fought, a portion of it escaped. All the line officers but three were
                        captured. The regiment now consists of a Colonel, Lieutenant Colonel, Major,
                        two Captains, one Lieutenant and forty men. Its loss was principally in
                        prisoners.</p>
