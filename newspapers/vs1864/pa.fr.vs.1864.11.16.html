                    <p>Hd.Qrs., Middle Military Div. <br>November 8.</p>
                    <p>General Sheridan has received informa[tion] that the rebels intend to
                        immediately assume the offensive. General Ewell has superseded General Early
                        in command of the rebel troops in the valley. Yesterday Fitzhugh Lee's
                        Division of cavalry was at Wardensville, on Cacapon River. Imboden was also
                        reported there. The rebel force at this point was over five thousand strong.
                        Mosby has been reinforced by a regiment of Virginia cavalry, and was
                        yesterday at Berryville.</p>
                    <p>A raid is expected on Winchester, or on the line of General Sheridan's
                        communications. The rebel movements have already been counteracted. To-day a
                        force from General Kelley's command successfully attacked a rebel force that
                        was moving towards Moorfield. A general engagement is now looked for in a
                        day or two. There is much indicating that the rebels will attempt to flank
                        General Sheridan in his position at Cedar Creek. Early has gone to
                    Richmond.</p>

<b>Desecration of the Pulpit</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Expresses anger that the Rev. F. W. Conrad has been preaching abolitionists
                    themes to the local Lutheran congregation.<br>(Names in announcement: Rev. F. W. Conrad)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On last Sunday morning a week--the Sunday immediately preceding the
                        Presidential Election--the Lutheran congregation of the place were regaled
                        with another Abolition harangue from the lips of the Rev. F. W. Conrad, the
                        Pastor in charge. We were not present to hear him, but we are told that such
                        his "speech" was disgusting and insulting in the extreme. As is well known,
                        no sooner had this man Conrad taken charge of the congregation than his
                        pulpit was converted into a political rostrum for the fulmination of
                        Abolition heresies and unqualified denunciation of all who did not fully
                        square up to the new standard of "loyalty" as laid down by Abraham Lincoln
                        and his worshippers; but it is said this last effort capped the climax of
                        fanaticism, and some few to our certain knowledge who still had a little
                        faith in him as a christian minister, have none at all now--having becoming
                        thoroughly convinced that he is nothing more than a noisy, windy,
                        half-crazed bigot and fanatic.</p>
                    <p>We regret exceedingly to be compelled to speak thus plainly of a professed
                        minister of Christ. We have heretofore refrained from saying aught while
                        urged to do so by others. But forbearance has ceased to be a virtue. We
                        conceive it to be our duty, as it is that of all right-thinking persons, to
                        raise our voice against this glaring evil which is rending in twain the
                        Church of the Redeemer. We write more in sorrow than in anger; for the Rev.
                        F. W. Conrad's Church is our Church. In her
                        worship we took delight, and in her communion and fellowship we realized
                        many seasons of enjoyment in the days when men were not reviled and persecuted by their brethren for entertaining honest
                        and conscientious political convictions, and before the pulpit of the Church
                        was turned into a rostrum and the demon of fanaticism had usurped the place
                        of the Prince of Peace.</p>
                    <p>On the occassion [sic] referred to the reverend gentleman, we are informed,
                        undertook to instruct this hearers how to vote!
                        He in effect stated that all who did not vote for Abraham Lincoln would be
                        eternally damned! Did mortal man ever hear of such a bold and shameless
                        assumption? Where does the Reverend Conrad obtain the right to instruct the
                        people how to vote? Where does he find his authority for making the
                        political opinions of a man the ground of his damnation? Surely not in the
                        great commission which directs him to go into all the world and preach the
                            Gospel (not politics) to every creature. We
                        are astonished that christian professors can countenance such a mockery of
                        religion--such a prostitution of the sacred office of the ministry--such a
                        violation of the holy Sabbath day--such a desecration of the pulpit and
                        sanctuary of the most High God!</p>
                    <p>Among the most mischievous influences which inaugurated the civil war now
                        raging in the land, and have since exasperated to diabolical hatred and
                        inhuman thirst for blood thousands of otherwise well meaning men, and even
                        inflamed to fury many of the gentler sex, is the prostitution of the pulpit
                        to partisan purposes and the degredation [sic] of clergymen from their
                        former position of usefulness to that of blatant advocates of destruction.
                        The preaching of the Reverend Conrad is of this character and has this
                        tendency. His speeches, or sermons if you please, are generally more noted
                        for rhapsody and denunciation, than for logic or truthfulness. His style is
                        of the transcendental type, largely partaking of the ranting and
                        enthusiastic. With all the zeal of a monomaniac, he combats an imaginary
                        foe--places him in a vulnerable position, and then demolishes with a
                        ruthless hand, the creation of his own brain, and claims with great egotism
                        a tremendous victory.</p>
                    <p>The introduction of politics into the pulpit by a faithless ministry, is the
                        main cause of the low state of religion in the land; and we cannot
                        reasonably expect the Church to prosper so long as the ministry are recreant
                        to their ordination vows, and continue to prostitute their sacred office.
                        While they minister in unholy things, and inflame the passions of the
                        people, and alienate a large portion of the community by their fanatical
                        course--the worship of God will wane--the courts of the sanctuary will be
                        neglected--and Zion will languish. Their ministration will be partial, and
                        pertain almost exclusively to things that are earthly and transient. Instead
                        of luring the soul to the skies, they chain it to the earth. Instead of
                        Christ, they preach an earthly potentate. Instead of promoting charity and
                        good will, they stir up strife and contention.</p>
                    <p>We pity a fallen minister, whose apostacy can be traced to extraordinary
                        temptations; but we execrate one who deliberately "steals the livery of
                        Heaven to serve the Devil in." We honor the minister who stoops not to soil
                        his office with unministerial acts, one who can preach Christ to all--who has access to all--who can beseech all to be reconciled
                        to God. Alas, how few yet remain in the pulpit who have not by their foolish
                        course, destroyed their usefulness. We could record numerous instances where
                        excellent and pious families have been driven from the Church by this
                        suicidal crime. No church can prosper under such a ministry.</p>
                    <p>To the class of ministers we have been describing belongs the Reverend
                        Conrad. Reverend Conrad, a professed follower of the meek and lowly Jesus;
                        Reverend Conrad, who chose the profession of preaching salvation to a fallen
                        race; Reverend Conrad, who came to announce glad tidings of the gospel of
                        peace and to save souls from perdition, (except "copperheads"); Reverend
                        Conrad, whose Master declared His kingdom was not of this world, and who
                        prayed not for the world but for those whom the Father had given him out of
                        the world; Reverend Conrad, a wolf in sheep's clothing, who preaches to the
                            animal and not to the spiritual man, for the applause of the multitude, and not for a
                        crown of life. In so doing, does he follow the example of the great Teacher,
                        during his mission on the earth? Did the Savior ever make political
                        speeches? Did the Apostles ever go along with the Cabal, idolizing and
                        glorifying man? Did the Disciples who were to go into all the world and
                        preach the gospel to every creature, betray their mission and make stump
                        speeches in the synogogue [sic] or elsewhere? Truly is the prophecy
                        fulfilled that in the last days perilous times shall come, with false
                        teachers having itching ears, turning many from the faith. From such turn
                        away.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Wednesday morning last about 10 o'clock, Mrs. Snoke, wife of William
                        Snoke, now a prisoner in Richmond, was found dead in the tenant house of Mr.
                        Henry Shearer, in which she resided, about one mile from Orrstown, in this
                        county. A jury of inquest was promptly summoned by William H. Blair, Esq.,
                        and a post-mortem examination of the corpse was made by Drs. Kennedy, of
                        Orrstown, and Hunter, of Strasburg. After a thorough examination of the
                        body, and a searching investigation of the circumstances attending the case,
                        the jury found that she came to her death by means of poison administered
                        with an intent to produce abortion; the deceased being in an advanced stage
                        of pregnancy. On Saturday last, Dr. S. D. Kell, a physician of Orrstown, was
                        arrested with the perpetration of the crime and was brought to this place
                        and confined in prison. He was brought before one of the Judges of our Court
                        on Monday last and admitted to bail in the sum of $5,000. It seems to us
                        that the bail taken in this case is insufficient, and that persons charged
                        with crimes of such high grade should be held in a larger amount. Some of
                        our Judges, however, appear to have reversed the usual order of things and
                        demand bail in an inverse ratio to the grade of crime charged; as an
                        evidence of which we would refer our readers to a recent case of Assault and Battery in which $5,000 bail was
                        demanded.</p>
