                    a return to the Union, would have been made, causing, instead of unity, divided

                    <p>We publish below the official returns of the late election in this county
                        including the army vote. The aggregate vote polled is the largest ever cast,
                        being 7683. This we believe is considerably in excess of the full legal vote
                        of the county and is swelled to these figures by the vote of a number of
                            <emph rend="italic">attaches</emph> of the army whose bona-fide
                        residence is in other localities but many of whom voted in this county. We

                    <p>After a previous notice having been given, a large congregation of citizens
                        of Mercersburg and vicinity assembled at 6 o'clock, P.M., in the German
                        Reformed Church. On motion the Rev. Dr. Creigh was appointed President and
                        A.M. Whetstone Secretary.</p>
                    <p>The object of the meeting as stated by the chair, was to adopt the measures
                        to aid in the general movement of effecting an amendment to the Constitution
                        of the United States so as to recognize the distinctive character of
                        christianity. The circular of the National Association was read (containing
                        a memorial to Congress,) after which quite an animated discussion of the
                        general subject ensued, in which the Rev. Dr. Harbaugh, Prof. Higby, Judge
                        Carson, Mr. Leidy, Dr. McDowell and others, participated. On motion, the
                        form of memorial (to Congress) of the National Association was adopted and a
                        committee appointed to obtain printed memorials and the signatures of our
                        citizens and forward the same to the corresponding secretary of the National
                        Association. On motion, the secretary and Samuel Bowles, Esq. were appointed
                        to attend the next meeting of the Association, which is to be held in
                        Philadelphia, on Tuesday, November 29th. The exercises of the evening were
                        interesting and partook of a devotional character. All present manifested an
                        interest in the proceedings of the meeting and a desire for the success of
                        the movement.</p>
