<b>The Constitution</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors explain that they reprinted the Constitution in this issue to
                    remind readers of the clauses that they believe are being violated by the
                    Lincoln administration. Among others, the confiscation act has deprived people
                    of property without due process, the admission of West Virginia was not done
                    with the consent of Virginia, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and
                    freedom from false imprisonment have all been violated by federal authorities,
                    the right of states to organize militias has been trumped by federal
                    conscription laws, and military authorities have interfered with free elections.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>A Bogus Senator</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors protest the attempt by Republicans to file a resignation for
                    Major White, a Republican state senator who has been unable to take his seat
                    because of his commission. White's resignation has not been presented to the
                    proper authorities, claim the editors, and thus there is no legal ground on
                    which they can hold a replacement election.<br>(Names in announcement:  Major White)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>The Age</blockquote>
<b>The Coming Financial Crash</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors cite a report by the Comptroller of the Currency that warns
                    that the end of the war may bring an end to the "apparent prosperity" of the
                    country. They accuse the Lincoln administration of misleading the country with
                    falsely optimistic statements about the future of the economy.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors note the call of the Repository to Congress to issue a ruthless
                    conscription bill, one that will, in the Spirit's words, "gobble up every poor
                    man as well as every man of moderate means, and force him into the army before
                    spring opens."<br>

<b>How to Avoid the Draft</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors reprint a call by Governor Curtain for volunteers to fill up
                    the 2nd and 9th Army Corps, under the command of Major Generals Winfield Hancock
                    and Ambrose Burnside. The following Pennsylvania regiments and batteries are
                    included. 2nd Army Corps: 53rd, 69th, 71st, 72nd, 81st, 106th, 116th, 140th,
                    145th, and 148th regiments, and Independent batteries C and F, and batteries F

                    100th regiments, and Durrell's Independent Battery D. The editors encourage
                    enlistment "thereby avoiding any necessity for another draft."<br>(Names in announcement: Governor  Curtain, Major General Winfield Hancock, Major General Ambrose Burnside)</blockquote>
<b>Another Draft</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors reprint an order from President Lincoln authorizing a draft for
                    500,000 men on March 10 for three years service. The editors note that this
                    follows on the October order for a draft of 300,000. This order includes the
                    300,000, and assumes a volunteer rate of 2000 per day. The order credits any men
                    who have been enlisted or drafted up to the 1st of March to the state's quota.<br>(Names in announcement: President Abraham Lincoln)</blockquote>
<b>The Nine Months' Men to be Drafted</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Senate has amended the conscription bill to exempt only those men
                    currently in the service, or who have been in the service two years and have
                    been honorably discharged, from the draft. This makes all those who served in
                    the nine months regiment subject to the draft. These veterans do receive an
                    additional bounty of $40 on top of the $362 for first-time enlistees.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>A Row</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A fight among members of the troops stationed in town took place in front
                    of the Post Office last Friday.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Friday night last, just after dark, considerable of a row was gotten up,
                        in front of the Post Office, by some of the military now stationed in and
                        near town. Several knock downs occurred; but we could not ascertain whether
                        cavalry or artillery came off second best. Our country's gallant defenders
                        appear so anxious for a fight, that, in the absence of rebels, in order to
                        keep their hands in, they occasionally pitch into each other.--Such displays
                        of the progress of our soldiers are not at all creditable, and no laurels
                        are to be gained in such encounters, we would therefore suggest that they
                        reserve their valor for the enemies of our country "away down South in
                        Dixie."</p>

                    spying for and giving intelligence to the enemy, and was sentenced to be hanged.
                    The finding and sentence were approved, but the sentence was commuted to
