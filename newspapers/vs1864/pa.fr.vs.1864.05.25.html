<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Fort Marcy, Va., May 13, 1864.</p>
                    <p>Editors of the Valley Spirit:</p>
                    <p>Gentlemen:--A few weeks ago I became a member of
                        Battery (Company) B, of the 2d Penna. Artillery. Soon after I was ushered
                        among the boys I ascertained that the Battery was partly composed of
                        Franklin county men, with whom I had no difficulty in associating, from the
                        fact that they are, generally, as well as a majority of the rest of the
                        Battery respectable, sociable and unassuming men.</p>
                    <p>In connection with the many newspapers that are received here I see the
                        Valley Spirit is a regular visitor to some of the boys. Its contents are
                        read and its doctrine approved by a number of the members of Battery B. At
                        the option of the Editors I will endeavor to give the readers of the Spirit
                        a few items of information which may be of interest to them.</p>
                    <p>Fort Marcy, which we at present garrison, is situated on the Virginia side,
                        about one-fourth mile from the banks of the Potomac river, in close
                        proximity with the large fort Ethan Allen and about five miles from the
                        National Capital. It is beautifully located on the summit of a hill, a
                        little more elevated than the many surrounding knolls; affording therefore a
                        splendid view of the surrounded devastated and war blighted country. From
                        the parapet of the fort can be seen the waters of the famous river Potomac
                        as they noiselessly approach in the distance, when they rapidly pass by
                        tossing, foaming and furiously splashing as they roll over uneven rocks, and
                        until they again, some miles below, assume the calmness so peculiar to this
                        element when undisturbed.</p>
                    <p>The fort mounts twenty-two guns ranging in different directions which from
                        their elevated position can be turned upon an object at a great distance.
                        These guns are manned by the members of Batteries B. C. and M., the rest of
                        the regiment being at fort Ethan Allen. From the condition of the fort and
                        guns and being manned by troops well versed in artillery, as well as
                        infantry tactics, as the men of these respective Batteries are, I have not
                        the least hesitancy in saying that an approaching enemy would be severely
                        dealt with.</p>
                    <p>Our officers deserve much credit for the careful attention they pay to
                        properly drilling and providing for their men. Col. A. A. Gibson, commanding
                        the regiment, is highly deserving of the popularity which he has gained for
                        himself and is well qualified for the high position he holds. He is
                        reasonably indulgent and kind to his men, but necessarily stern and resolute
                        in the enforcement of that discipline so indispensable to the efficiency of
                        military organizations.</p>
                    <p>Capt. Barney, late commander of Battery B, having been favored with the
                        colonelcy of the new regiment formed out of the excess of men enlisted for
                        the 2d artillery, the Battery is now under command of Lieut. Guisinger. He
                        is a man of noble qualities--unassuming and in every way gentlemanly. An old
                        adage and frequently expressed, says, "We all have our enemies," but I must
                        say this for Lieut. Guisinger, that I do not believe he has one enemy among
                        the men under his command. All seem to entertain the greatest respect and
                        kindest regard for him, of which his conduct makes him highly deserving.</p>
                    <p>Our orderly or first Sergeant, Mr Gayette, is by birth a Frenchman. Men are
                        few in number who are so well calculated to fill the important position of
                        Orderly Sergeant in a military company. His military qualification and his
                        energy in the discharge of his duties qualify him for a higher position.</p>
                    <p>I am under obligations to Corporal Beldel from Chambersburg for the patience,
                        and interest he has manifested in teaching me military tactics and "how to
                        shoot." The Franklin county men are generally well and in good spirits over
                        the late war news, all hoping that in a year hence the war will be over and
                        they can again enjoy the blessing of peace in their homes in old Franklin.</p>
                    <p>RAW RECRUIT.</p>
