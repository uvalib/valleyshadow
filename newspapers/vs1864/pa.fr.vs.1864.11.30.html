<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We publish below the official returns of the late election in this county
                        including the army vote. The aggregate vote polled is the largest ever cast,
                        being 7683. This we believe is considerably in excess of the full legal vote
                        of the county and is swelled to these figures by the vote of a number of
                            attaches of the army whose bona-fide
                        residence is in other localities but many of whom voted in this county. We
                        congratulate the gallant Democracy of Franklin county on the fact that the
                        "Green Spot" has been revolutionized, and that in future elections when the
                        votes of her own citizens, alone, are cast, their success is certain by
                        several hundred majority.</p>
