                            Waters," by James Bumgardner, Jr., May, 1913</h3>
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> An obituary of Captain James H. Waters, a soldier in the Virginia 5th Infantry
                    Division.</p>
<p>Capt. James H. Waters departed this life on May 13,
                    1913, at the Odd Fellows' Home in Lynchburg, Va.,
                    in the eighty-fifth year of his age. He came from New Jersey to Staunton, Va., in 1850. He engaged in business, married Miss
                    Elizabeth Carroll, a native of Staunton, and promptly identified himself with
                    the people of that place. He was one of the original enlisted members of that
                    renowned volunteer company, the West Augusta Guard, which was organized in 1858,
                    was in service during the John Brown raid in 1859, and on during the entire
                    period of the War of the States. It was in service during the late war with
                    Spain, and is now one of the best companies in the volunteer military service of
                    Virginia.</p>
<p>At the organization of the company Captain Waters was elected first lieutenant;
                    and when the company was ordered to Charlestown during the John Brown raid,
                        Capt. (afterwards Col.) William S. H. Baylor (who was later killed at Manassas on August
                    29, 1862, while leading the Stonewall Brigade in a desperate charge) was
                    prostrated with typhoid fever, and Captain Waters commanded the company.</p>
<p>The West Augusta Guard was of the 5th Regiment of Virginia Infantry, in the
                    Stonewall Brigade. This regiment was organized about the 12th of April, 1861, as
                    "a volunteer regiment of Virginia militia," and William S. H. Baylor, captain of
                    the West Augusta Guard, was made colonel.</p>
<p>On April 17, 1861, the West Augusta Guard, under command of Lieutenant Waters, by
                    command of the Governor of Virginia, left Staunton for Harper's Ferry. The order
                    of the Governor reached Staunton about 8 A.M. of that day, and the company
                    embarked about 6 P.M. of the same day. There were of the company on that April
                    day (1861) one hundred and twenty-five men, rank and file. When the roll was
                    called, one hundred and twenty-three answered to their names and boarded the
                    train. Captain Waters was commissioned as captain in May, 1861, and commanded
                    the company at Falling Waters, First Manassas, during the Romney expedition of
                    General Jackson, and at Kernstown. In July, 1862, he was made commissary of the
                    5th Regiment with the rank of captain, and was soon afterwards made commissary
                    of the Stone-wall Brigade, and served in that capacity until the close of the
                    war.</p>
<p>In 1880 he was made chief of the police department of Staunton, in which capacity
                    he rendered devoted and efficient service until 1900, when he was retired by
                    reason of advanced age and infirmity. After his retirement as chief of police of
                    Staunton, Captain Waters went to the Odd Fellows' Home in Lynchburg, where he
                    remained until his death. His funeral service was held in the Odd Fellows' Home,
                    after which his body was transported to Staunton and on the 15th of May, 1913,
                    was buried in Thornrose Cemetery. His body was followed to its final resting
                    place by the three sole survivors of the men who originally enlisted in the West
                    Augusta Guard-viz., Henry Hyer, William Wholly, and James Bumgardner, Jr.</p>
<p>Captain Waters was a member of the Episcopal Church, and his entire life was an
                    illustration of the best and noblest qualities of the Christian, the soldier,
                    and the gentleman.</p>
