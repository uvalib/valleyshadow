                <p>In 1914, Kauffman's Progressive reprinted this newspaper article--originally
                    published in 1862--that describes the Ladies' Aid Association of Greencastle in
                    glowing terms and asks readers to subscribe money.</p>

            <div1 type="article" id="d5">
                <p>At a meeting of ladies and clergymen of this place, in the lecture room of the
                    Presbyterian church for the purpose of forming a society to relieve the sick and
                    wounded soldiers of our Army and Navy, the <abbr expan="Reverend">Rev.</abbr>
                    Appel was called to the chair, and <abbr expan="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Hartsock
                    chosen Secretary. The following Ladies were elected officers of the Association.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Breidenbaugh, president; Mrs. Bentz, secretary and Mrs. Hartsock, treasurer.</p>
                <p>A board of managers, consisting of eight, was chosen, viz: Mrs. Rupley,
                    McLanaham, Michael, Weaver, Wallace, Appel, and Misses Robison and Detrich.</p>
                <p>At a subsequent meeting of the Association the following regulations wore
                    adopted. The society shall hold its regular meetings on Wednesday afternoon of
                    each week, commencing at two o'clock in Burns hall, (which was kindly offered to
                    them by the Reading Club). Any lady can become a member of this Association, by
                    paying the sum of 12 1/2 cents. We invite all who are friends of our soldiers,
                    to aid us in this good work. The following ladies were appointed soliciting
                    committees for the town:</p>
                <p>Misses McLanahan, Michael, Prather, Kunkel, Hays, Hartman, Rowe Shirey.</p>
                <p>For the county:</p>
                <p>Misses Empich, Davison, Stine, Young, Brown and Gordon.</p>
                <p>Donations of money, material for making up clothing, socks, yarn, all kinds of
                    canned and dried fruit, jellies, and any articles suitable for hospitals, can be
                    sent to these ladies, or to Burns Hall, on Wednesday afternoon. S. C. B., <abbr
                        expan="Secretary">Sec'y</abbr>.</p>
                <p>It will be seen from the above report of proceeding, that a "Ladies Aid" Society
                    has been organized in Antrim. We have not room at present to speak of the
                    necessity of such organization. Indeed, it is useless, when there are
                    twenty-eight thousand sick and wounded soldiers in the United States Hospitals.
                    Do not they deserve attention, and every comfort we can bestow upon them? Some
                    of them have been stricken down in battle, while fighting for their country, and
                    to protect your homes and ours.</p>
                <p>There is no time to be lost. What the ladies want most is money. Fill up the
                    subscription papers. A good sum now is worth more than many driblets. If each
                    one does his duty, we will do as much as any other district in the State.
                    Readers! the subject is before you; the ladies are soliciting money; and you
                    have now an opportunity to alleviate the sufferings of many a noble patriot.
                    Shall the appeal be coldly and mercilessly rejected?</p>
