                    Border People Had Peace at Last-Peculiar Political Conditions-How Cameron Lost
                    His Candidate for Auditor General by His Struggle to Obtain Control of the Party

                    of the Republican Ticket.</p>
<p>THE darkest hour is, sometimes just before the break of day, and the people of
                    smitten Chambersburg realized the truth of the adage within a week or ten days
                    after the adjournment of the Legislature that had refused them any measure of
                    relief, leaving them to struggle with despair. About midnight on the 9th of
                    April, 1865, when the sorely-depressed people of Chambersburg were at rest, many
                    of them in hastily-improvised homes, the bell of the courthouse that had been
                    hastily rebuilt awaked the community from its slumbers as it rang out its
                    loudest tones. The ringing was continued for a considerable time, and in a
                    little while the bells of churches, which had escaped the torch of the vandal,
                    joined in the welcome music. It was known to all that there was then no
                    immediate danger of a raid from the enemy, and all understood that some cheerful
                    news had come to the desolated town.</p>
<p>I was waked from sleep in the little cottage formerly occupied by a colored house
                    servant, that Captain Smith, in his haste, had neglected to burn. My first  impression was that shared by nearly all when the first toll of
                    the bell was heard, that some new danger threatened, but very little reflection
                    made me understand that there could be no immediate peril to the community, and
                    that the bells were ringing out the proclamation of some achievement toward
                    peace. After a hurried and imperfect toilet I hastened toward the town and first
                    heard the echo of cheers from the center of the village, and as I approached
                    nearer I was finally enabled to distinguish the shouts which mingled with the
                    cheers of the people, announcing that Lee had surrendered. The trained lightning
                    had flashed the same message from Eastern to Western sea, and there was
                    universal rejoicing throughout the entire loyal brotherhood of people, but in no
                    one community was the news so profoundly appreciated, or so wildly welcomed, as
                    in Chambersburg and its beautiful and bountiful surroundings on the border.</p>
<p>For four long years the people of Franklin County had been under the severe
                    strain of border warfare. They had been raided in 1862 by Stuart, in 1863 by
                    Jenkins, in 1864 by McCausland, who had levelled
                    Chambersburg to ashes, and in addition Lee's army occupied the county for some
                    days before the battle of Gettysburg. There was no time during those four years
                    when Moseby, or any like commander of Southern raiders,
                    could not have penetrated even as far north as Chambersburg in a single night,
                    excepting only in the dead of winter. The people had not only suffered from
                    actual raids, but by the appropriation of property alike by Union and Southern
                    soldiers, and there was rarely a month during any of the four summers when they
                    were not under the exhausting strain of apprehension of raids or invasion from
                    the South. To these long-suffering people, who had not only given their full
                    quota of their fathers and sons to join in the flame of  battle for
                    the Union, but had suffered constant waste and terrible anxiety, the surrender
                    of Lee meant more than peace to the nation, and the final triumph of the Union
                    cause; it meant to them peace in their homes, protection against robbery, and
                    safety in the pursuit of their daily avocations.</p>
<p>I have many times seen aggregations of people express enthusiastic delight, but
                    never before nor since have I witnessed a mass of people express such
                    whole-souled gratification. Not only those who rent the air with their cheers,
                    and the many enthusiasts who shook hands and embraced each other in the fervor
                    of their joy, but there were other hundreds of men and women whose mute but
                    expressive eloquence told the story that at last relief had come to the
                    long-fretted and plundered people. To them it was not only peace to State and
                    Nation, but it was rest in the homes which had long been racked by constant
                    apprehension. All who were able to leave their beds were on the street, and
                    remained there until the light of another day broke in the east as the sun arose
                    to shine upon the liberated people.</p>
<p>The surrender of Lee that was soon followed by the surrender of Johnston, and
                    later by every organized Confederate command in the field, at once brought the
                    people of the North to face the new grave problems which confronted them. The
                    North had overthrown the military power of the Confederacy, and the Confederacy
                    itself was hopelessly destroyed, with its chief executive a prisoner at Fortress
                    Monroe. General Grant, with all his heroic record, exhibited the highest heroism
                    of his life when he dictated the generous terms on which the surrender of Lee's
                    army was accepted. He was severely criticised by
                    the more radical element of the Republican party, but the people of the country
                    very soon learned to appreciate how grandly Grant had  vindicated
                    himself, and how, in defiance of well-known views of the cabinet, he had opened
                    the door wide for the return of peace by paroling General Lee and all the
                    officers of his army, under the solemn assurance that they could return to their
                    homes and remain unmolested as long as they obeyed the laws of the government in
                    force in their respective localities.</p>
<p>This condition, for which Grant was alone responsible, made it impossible for the
                    government, without violating its solemnly plighted faith, to persecute or
                    punish any of the officers in Lee's army; and some months later, when President
                    Johnson, in the floodtide of his vindictive assaults upon the South after he
                    became President, decided to inflict some punishment upon Lee and other
                    officers, Grant, then the General of the army, notified the President that he
                    would be guilty of an act of dishonor in violating any of the terms of Lee's
                    surrender, and stated distinctly that if the President attempted it the General
                    could no longer, with self-respect, hold a commission in the army of the United
                    States. That position assumed by General Grant, and that alone, saved Johnson
                    from adding to his many other follies the prosecution of Lee's paroled officers
                    and other Confederate generals. While all in the North had been for several
                    years discussing the basis of peace with little agreement of public sentiment,
                    Grant solved the problem himself by teaching the Nation that the way to peace
                    was by the highest measure of magnanimity to the vanquished. I honor Grant more
                    for what he did at Appomattox than for any military achievement of his life. He
                    not only heroically blazed the way to peace, but his first thought after signing
                    the surrender with Lee, and voluntarily issuing an order for all of Lee's
                    exhausted heroes to be bountifully fed from the Union commissary stores, made
                    him hurriedly start to Washington to take the promptest  measures
                    for the reduction of the army to halt the appalling expenses of the war.</p>
<p>With all the enormous taxes gathered from the people to support the war; with the
                    lavish expenditure for bounties that loaded not only cities and counties but
                    townships with enormous debt, the debt of the nation was over two billions, and
                    there were few, indeed, at that day who were hopeful that the National credit
                    could be maintained. The government bonds were payable in coin, and silver was
                    at a premium over gold, while in all the transactions of every-day life among
                    the people the currency of the nation was accepted as a legal tender enforced by
                    law, when a dollar of the lawful money of the country did not purchase
                    two-thirds thirds of its face value in the necessaries of life. Had President
                    Johnson at once planted himself on a peace platform with Grant after he had
                    waded into the Presidency through the tears of a bereaved nation, there would
                    have been less disturbance and uncertainty in the North, but he started out to
                    pursue the leading men of the South most vindictively. He proclaimed Davis and
                    others as assassins of President Lincoln, and his whole policy seemed to have
                    but one aim and that to plunge the two sections, at the close of the war, into
                    an aftermath of even more fiendish hatred and brutality than war itself had
                    given. Fortunately, he changed his attitude before the summer ended, but, like
                    the violently-swung pendulum that had gone beyond its normal point, the swing of
                    vengeance naturally exceeded the normal point of generous peace in its rebound.</p>
<p>These conditions brought the Republican leaders of Pennsylvania to a sober
                    realization of the new duties which had come upon the party. We had a National
                    administration that was ostensibly Republican, and yet the new President had
                    already taken two positions  on the question of adjustment with the
                    South so violently extreme and so violently opposing each other that the party
                    was placed in a very embarrassing condition when the State convention of 1865
                    met at Harrisburg to nominate candidates for auditor general and surveyor
                    general. The incumbents of those offices were Democrats, having been elected in
                    the Republican break of 1862, caused chiefly by the Emancipation Proclamation,
                    but neither Auditor General Slenker nor Surveyor General Barr was a candidate
                    for renomination. The Democrats were greatly encouraged by the varying radical
                    policies of the President, and at the time their convention met they were
                    hopeful, and a with good reason, that Johnson would gradually, and at an early
                    day, develop into a full-fledged Democratic President. They placed at the head
                    of their ticket for auditor general the gallant Democratic soldier, General
                    Davis, of Doylestown, who was not only distinguished as a soldier, but a
                    gentleman of the highest character and admirable personal qualities. For
                    surveyor general they nominated John Linton, of Cambria, who had been a Whig in
                    the earlier days, and unusually strong in the interior of the State, and they
                    made an earnest battle; but public sentiment was easily aroused against placing
                    the Democrats in power to make peace after four years of war, whose policy they
                    had so generally opposed, and General Davis was defeated by over 20,000.</p>
<p>The Republicans had every indication of a very peaceful convention. John A.
                    Heistand, of Lancaster, then editor of one of the leading inland Republican
                    papers of the State, who had served in both house and senate, was a candidate
                    for auditor general. He was ranked as a supporter of General Cameron, but while
                    he faithfully followed Cameron in every emergency that called for a rally of
                    Cameron's friends, he maintained  very friendly relations with
                    Governor Curtin, and nearly or quite all the men around him. He knew that the
                    friends of Curtin would be likely to control the convention, and he personally
                    visited Curtin and others closely connected with him and appealed to them to
                    assent to his nomination for auditor general and have the party with a united
                    front and a candidate who would not be presented to the people by a faction. He
                    was a jolly, genial fellow, was personally liked by all who knew him, and some
                    time before the meeting of the convention Curtin and his people had all assented
                    to the nomination of Heistand for auditor general.</p>
<p>The convention was composed of a number of the ablest of the Republican leaders,
                    including Thaddeus Stevens, who had consented to come as a delegate for
                    Heistand; General Todd, of Carlisle, who was one of the ablest and boldest of
                    leaders in the fight; John Cessna, of Bedford, ex-Democratic speaker, with many
                    others of much more than ordinary ability and influence. The convention was
                    known to have a decided majority of delegates who were friends of Curtin, but as
                    there was to be no contest on the nomination of Heistand, a follower of Cameron,
                    for auditor general, it was accepted all around that there was little or nothing
                    to do beyond the formality of making nominations. The morning session of the
                    convention was devoted to the appointment of committees for permanent
                    organization, resolutions, etc., and after a brief session adjourned to meet in
                    the afternoon.</p>
<p>Before the meeting of the afternoon session it became whispered around that
                    Cameron, not content with getting the head of the ticket from the Curtin
                    convention, had manipulated the committee on permanent organization by
                    compelling Heistand to give his two members of the committee from Lancaster
                    County to the Cameron side, and thus nominate Johnson, a  prominent
                    and aggressive friend of Cameron, for president of the convention. Inquiry was
                    at once made, and we ascertained that Cameron had forced Heistand to transfer
                    the committeemen from his own county against their wishes to the Cameron
                    candidate for president, and a murmur of indignation swelled up at once
                    throughout the whole Curtin ranks, as Cessna was expected to be named without a
                    contest. A hasty conference was called in which Stevens participated, as he felt
                    that the transfer of the committeemen from his own county under Cameron's order
                    was an outrage not to be pardoned, and we decided that instead of defeating the
                    Cameron candidate for president of the convention, as we could have done, we
                    would give him a unanimous election, and then when he entered the chair, and was
                    presumably in possession of the power of the convention, we would publicly
                    impale him.</p>
<p>When Heistand was reproached for his perfidy to the Curtin people, he could do no
                    more nor less than to admit that Cameron had demanded it of him, and in less
                    than an hour the convention that was to nominate Heistand for auditor general
                    unanimously, organized to defeat him, and then to strip the president of the
                    convention of his power to appoint the chairman of the State committee. Stevens
                    said that he would obey his instructions and vote for the nomination of
                    Heistand, but insisted that he had committed an outrage that should be resented,
                    and he participated in the conference that decided who should be presented to
                    defeat Heistand, and how it should be done. Cameron's purpose in forcing
                    Heistand to betray his Curtin friends in the selection of the president of the
                    convention was to be able to name the chairman of the State committee, either
                    for himself or for some one who would be distinctly in his interest, and with a
                    Cameron man at the head of the ticket, a Cameron man president of 
                    the convention, and a Cameron man chairman of the State committee, he would
                    present the appearance of omnipotence in the State.</p>
<p>I was one of three men assigned to the duty of conferring with General Hartranft,
                    who was present at the convention, but not a delegate, to ask him to accept a
                    nomination for auditor general. I might here say that at that time General
                    Hartranft was regarded by Curtin and his friends as their candidate for Governor
                    the following year, 1866, and Hartranft, of course, had no thought of being
                    auditor general, and reluctantly accepted it; but as the men who urged him to
                    accept were the men upon whom he depended for the gubernatorial nomination, he
                    finally yielded to their importunities, and agreed that his name should be
                    presented to the convention if we thought it best to do so.</p>
<p>It was known that the Democrats would present General Davis, a distinguished
                    soldier, for the office, and it was arranged that General Todd, who had a good
                    military record, and who was a most eloquent champion of any cause he supported,
                    should present the name of Hartranft to the convention, and demand his
                    nomination as a matter of justice to the gallant soldiers of Pennsylvania. John
                    Cessna, who had been a Democrat, legislator and speaker of the house, and who
                    had been slaughtered by Heistand, followed Todd in support of the soldier
                    candidate, and several other able like appeals were made; and when the first
                    ballot was footed up, Heistand was dumfounded to discover that he was largely
                    defeated by Hartranft, who had been sprung upon the convention just on the spur
                    of the moment. The convention made its record consistent by nominating General
                    J. M. Campbell, another gallant soldier, for surveyor general, thus presenting a
                    solid soldier ticket of candidates exceptionally strong.</p>
<p>After the nominations had been made the work of  the convention was
                    about to conclude, and Stevens rose in his place and offered a resolution that
                    John Cessna be appointed chairman of the Republican State committee. The Cameron
                    leaders at once saw that they had not only defeated themselves in the convention
                    for auditor general, but that their control of the president of the body was to
                    bring them nothing but humiliation. They vainly urged that it was the immemorial
                    custom of the party to have the president of the convention appoint the chairman
                    of the State committee in consultation with the candidates on the State ticket,
                    but it was answered that the president of the convention of 1864 had appointed
                    the chairman of the State committee against the expressed wishes of nearly
                    three-fourths of the members of the body. It was a hopeless fight for the
                    already-defeated supporters of Cameron, and the resolution was carried by a
                    decided majority. Cameron not only thus lost his candidate for auditor general,
                    who would have been accepted by the Curtin people, but he had an aggressive
                    anti-Cameron man placed at the head of the organization, instead of one
                    reasonably acceptable to both sides, as would have been done if Heistand had not
                    been compelled to violate his faith with his Curtin friends and defeat himself.</p>
<p>It was a most unexpected and humiliating defeat for Heistand, but he realized
                    that he had been forced wantonly to provoke the battle that unhorsed him. He was
                    popular with his people, who later sent him to Congress for two terms, and
                    closed his official career as naval officer of Philadelphia, a position with
                    liberal salary and little or nothing to do. He enjoyed the navy office
                    immensely, and frequently gave high encomiums to the genius of Alexander
                    Hamilton, who had created one honorable and lucrative office with limited
                    duties, which could be performed wholly by  assistants. Like many
                    others, as age grew upon him he did not appreciate the celerity with which
                    business conditions were advancing about him, and that journalism was a most
                    exacting mistress, and he went on in the good old quiet way until others
                    outstripped him in his calling. Then broken health came; his life-work was
                    finished, and green memories come back to many in the gentle whispers from the
                    tomb.</p>
