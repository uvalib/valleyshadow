<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> This obituary from the Confederate Veteran honors
                    William E. Bell, who served in the Stonewall Brigade.</p>
<p>William E. Bell, a member of Company C, 5th Virginia Infantry, Stonewall Brigade,
                    died at his home near Mossy Creek, Va., March 12,
                    1912. He enlisted at the beginning of the war and served until the end at
                    Appomattox, most of the time with the sharpshooters of his regiment. He was one
                    of eighteen young men of the name (brothers and cousins) who went to the front
                    from the same neighborhood and served in the same company, six of whom were
                    killed or died from wounds and five of whom died from disease during the war.
                    Mr. Bell was wounded at Sailor's Creek; and except for the few weeks he was at
                    home recovering from his wound, he was with his company at the front during the
                    entire four years of the war.</p>
