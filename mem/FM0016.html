<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> This chapter offers a favorable description of Hooker's efforts to frustrate
                    Lee's invasion of the North and an account of the Confederate occupation of
                    Chambersburg in June 1863. The descriptions of the occupation hiasize the
                    Confederate army's discipline and respect for private property.</p>
<p>Hooker's Suggestions Rejected by Lincoln-Hooker's Strategy Defeated Lee's
                    Movement to Cross the Potomac near Washington-Meade Suddenly Called to
                    Command-Large Emergency Force Called to the Field-Severe Discipline of Lee's
                    Army-Jenkins' Raid into Chambersburg-Ewell's Requisition for Supplies Including
                    Sauerkraut in Midsummer-Lee's Headquarters at Shetter's Grove.</p>
<p>AFTER the defeat of Hooker at Chancellorsville the opposing armies fell back to
                    their former positions, and remained there until the Gettysburg movement began.
                    On the 2d of June Lee's army was encamped on the south bank of the Rappahannock,
                    near the city of Fredericksburg, and Hooker's army was on the north bank of the
                    same river among the Stafford Hills and nearly opposite that city. Hooker's army
                    consisted of eight corps, commanded by Reynolds, Hancock, Sickles, Meade,
                    Sedgwick, Howard and Slocum, with Pleasanton's cavalry corps, and Lee's army
                    consisted of four corps, commanded by Longstreet, Ewell, and A. P. Hill, with
                    Stuart commanding the cavalry. There has been much dispute as to the strength of
                    the two armies which met at Gettysburg, but after a careful investigation of all
                    the varied statements on the subject, I think it safe to assume that Lee's army
                    numbered 80,000, and that Meade's army, as stated by himself in his testimony
                    before a committee of Congress on the conduct of the war, numbered 95,000. His
                    precise language was that his "army numbered a little under 100,000, probably
                    95,000." They were nearly or quite equal in artillery and cavalry, and Lee's
                    army, flushed with repeated  victories, was entirely confident that
                    it could defeat the Army of the Potomac on any field where they might meet.</p>
<p>Hooker was reinforcing and reorganizing his army. It had become greatly
                    demoralized by Burnside's failures, and the open quarrels forced upon him by his
                    subordinate commanders. Hooker had reorganized the commissary and quartermaster
                    departments, getting ample supplies, and the steady stream of reinforcements
                    that came more than filled the places of many thousands whose term of service
                    expired. Although he had suffered a disastrous defeat at Chancellorsville, the
                    army had confidence in him, as he was known to be one of the best fighters among
                    its officers. The crippled condition in which his army was left after the defeat
                    at Chancellorsville, and by the expiration of the term of service of a large
                    number of his troops, required that he should have time to get his army restored
                    alike in numbers and efficiency. Lee was also largely reinforcing his army, and
                    when he started in his campaign of invasion he commanded the largest Confederate
                    army that ever appeared on a battlefield.</p>
<p>For several weeks the two opposing armies remained inactive on the opposite sides
                    of the Rappahannock, near Fredericksburg. Lee knew that it would be some time
                    before Hooker could take the field in an aggressive movement against him, and he
                    had ample time to perfect his plans and complete his preparations for the
                    Gettysburg campaign that had come to be recognized as an inexorable necessity,
                    regardless of the fact that it had to be planned and executed in opposition to
                    the accepted military laws which usually govern armies in the field.</p>
<p>The Confederacy could not survive without the recognition of foreign governments,
                    and it was finally accepted by the Southern leaders, and doubtless in  accordance with the most reliable advices from their friends in England and
                    France, that the transfer of the war to Northern soil, the defeat of the Union
                    army and the capture of Baltimore and Washington would at once command the
                    recognition of the Confederacy and end the war.</p>
<p>While Hooker could make no movement against Lee in Fredericksburg, he kept very
                    close watch upon Lee's movements, and as early as the 28th of May he was fully
                    convinced that Lee had decided upon the invasion of Maryland or Pennsylvania,
                    and so wrote the President. His information given to the President was fully
                    vindicated, as on the 2d of June Lee's army commenced its movement by Ewell's
                    corps advancing to Culpeper Court House. This was followed by Longstreet's corps
                    and General Lee himself on the 3d, and by the 8th of June all of Lee's army,
                    excepting Hill's corps, that remained at Fredericksburg to watch Hooker, was
                    concentrated at Culpeper Court House. Hooker was very anxious to attack Lee's
                    rear at Fredericksburg, and suggested it to the President, who promptly
                    disapproved of the plan as he would have to attack the enemy in entrenchments,
                    and, to use Lincoln's own language, "so man for man worse you at that point,
                    while his main force would in some way be getting an advantage of you
                    northward." Hooker's next suggestion takes high rank in heroic purpose, as he
                    urged the President to permit him to let Lee move northward while he would make
                    a forced march upon Richmond, to which Lincoln replied: "I think Lee's army and
                    not Richmond is your sure objective point." At that time Lee's army was
                    stretched out with its rear between Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville, and the
                    head of it at Martinsburg, and Lincoln made this quaint but incisive suggestion
                    to Hooker: "If the head of Lee's army is at Martinsburg and the rear of it on
                    the  plank road between Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville, the
                    animal must be very slim somewhere; could you not break him?"</p>
<p>On the 5th of June Hooker began a movement to keep in touch with Lee and
                    gradually advanced his different corps to hold the interior line between Lee and
                    the Capital, and also between Lee and the Potomac. He had a very efficient
                    cavalry force, and kept it constantly employed in reconnoissance to ascertain the movements of the enemy. On the 8th
                    of June Hooker had his cavalry corps making a reconnoissance in force south of the Rappahannock. Pleasanton's
                    cavalry crossed the river at night and, protected by a heavy fog, struck the
                    main force of Stuart's cavalry corps, compelled it to retreat, and came into
                    possession of Stuart's headquarters, in which Stuart's important papers were
                    captured, including Lee's orders outlining his movement into Maryland and
                    Pennsylvania. A heavy infantry force came to the support of the Confederate
                    cavalry, and the purpose of the reconnoissance
                    being fully accomplished, Pleasanton retired, but that cavalry conflict, and the
                    information derived from General Stuart's orders received from Lee, defeated one
                    of the most important features of Lee's plan.</p>
<p>Lee's purpose was to move along the east base of the Blue Ridge, cross the
                    Potomac near Washington, where he could operate on an interior line. Hooker's
                    army was promptly hastened forward and Lee was compelled to make his invasion by
                    first entering the Shenandoah Valley, thus greatly lengthening his line, and
                    making Baltimore and Washington, his objective points, twice or thrice the
                    distance from him after he crossed the Potomac that they would have been if
                    Hooker had not discovered his plans and compelled him to change them. If he had
                    crossed the Potomac in the neighborhood of Poolsville and the Monocacy as was
                        indi-cated in his instructions to Stuart, he would have been
                    saved long marching to the upper Potomac and back again to Gettysburg, and could
                    have delivered his decisive battle certainly ten days sooner with less depletion
                    of his army because of a shorter line from its base.</p>
<p>On the 21st of June Hooker had his army so placed that every approach to
                    Washington south of the Potomac was completely guarded, and Lee was in the
                    Shenandoah Valley and unable to obtain information of Hooker's movements.
                    Hooker's strategy in meeting Lee's movements was masterly, and when he found
                    that Lee was certain to cross the Potomac he was moving with his army in
                    Maryland extended on a long line north and south to enable him to concentrate
                    speedily against Lee whether he moved by the Susquehanna or the Potomac line
                    toward Washington. He urged that Milroy, who had some 8,000 men at Winchester,
                    should evacuate that place, retire from the valley and join his command. General
                    Schenck, with headquarters in Baltimore, in whose department Milroy was
                    operating, ordered Milroy to retire from the valley, but Milroy was a soldier
                    with more courage than discretion, and begged to be permitted to remain,
                    declaring that he would defeat any force of the enemy that could be brought
                    against him. Schenck, unfortunately, left the question to the discretion of
                    Milroy, and the result was that Milroy's 8,000 men were defeated, routed,
                    several thousand of them captured, along with vast stores of guns and supplies,
                    and that entire force was lost to the Army of the Potomac.</p>
<p>It became known throughout Pennsylvania early in June that Lee's movement was
                    reasonably certain to lead to the invasion of the North, and the government at
                    Washington created two new military departments in Pennsylvania-that of the
                    Monongahela, with head-quarters at Pittsburg, assigned to Major General W. T. H. Brooks, and the Department
                    of the Susquehanna, with headquarters at Harrisburg, assigned to Major General
                    D. N. Couch. On the 12th of June Governor Curtin issued a proclamation to the
                    people of the State warning them of the danger of invasion and calling for
                    volunteers to meet the emergency, but as the peril was to the National cause
                    quite as much as to Pennsylvania, President Lincoln on the 15th called upon the
                    States of Pennsylvania, Maryland, New York, New Jersey, Ohio and West Virginia
                    to funish 120,000 of their militia for temporary
                    service. The Governors of the States seconded the call of the President; but
                    there was then hardly any organized militia remaining in the States, and the
                    response was 25,000 from Pennsylvania, 15,000 from New York, 5,000 from
                    Maryland, 3,000 from New Jersey, 2,000 from West Virginia, making a total of
                    50,000. Most of them reported at Harrisburg, and General William F. Smith,
                    better known as "Baldy" Smith, and General Dana were each given a division under
                    General Couch. This emergency militia gave no aid to the Army of the Potomac in
                    the battle of Gettysburg, but it is probable that the presence of General
                    Smith's division at Harrisburg prevented General Rhodes, who occupied Carlisle
                    and whose pickets were at one time within a few miles of Harrisburg, from
                    capturing the State Capital. Beyond that the militia rendered no service
                    whatever.</p>
<p>It was not the fault of the emergency troops, as they did all that was in their
                    power. They were hastily thrown together, without discipline, quartermaster or
                    commissary organizations, and when marching through the Cumberland Valley lived
                    upon the country and were vastly more destructive foragers than were the
                    Confederates. Lee's army was under strict discipline and also under severe
                    orders against the need-less destruction of private property.
                    Ewell's corps occupied the 200-acre field on my farm, at the edge of
                    Chambersburg. The middle fences had all been destroyed by military visitors, and
                    more or less of his corps remained there for a week. His 22,000 men did less
                    injury to private property in a week's occupation than did one regiment of New
                    York militia in a single day when it made its camp in the same field.</p>
<p>General Jenkins, with a large cavalry force, led the advance of Lee's invasion,
                    and he crossed the Potomac at Williamsport on the evening of June 14. The people
                    in the Cumberland Valley had notice of the approach of the enemy by the
                    scattered fragments of the Milroy forces which covered all the highways reaching
                    north in squads of ten, twenty or more, thoroughly demoralized, and well
                    calculated to terrorize the community. On the 15th of June the people of the
                    border commenced a general exodus northward with their live stock, and the
                    wildest excitement prevailed. Merchants hurried their goods away to points in
                    the East, banks shipped all their money and families sent their valuables, while
                    all the roads were crowded with fleeing, terrorized people, driving their stock
                    away from the enemy. There was no military force whatever to impede the advance
                    of Jenkins, and early in the evening of the 15th it was known in Chambersburg
                    that his force was rapidly advancing upon the town. He reached Chambersburg
                    about eleven o'clock at night, took possession of the town without a conflict,
                    passed through the main street leaving a strong guard in the town, and made his
                    camp on my farm, as did all the armies of both sides in their valley campaigns
                    during the war. He made his headquarters in my comfortable farmhouse, and used
                    the large barn as a hospital, where Mrs. McClure provided the sick soldiers with
                    all the necessaries, including medicines. I was impressively 
                    reminded of this fact thirty years after the war, when, on a visit to
                    Montgomery, Ala., while a guest of the hospitable
                    Governor of the State. Notice was brought to the Governor that a man at the door
                    specially desired to see me. The Governor did not recognize the name, but
                    invited him to join us. When he came into the room he apologized in his awkward
                    way for his intrusion, and said that having heard that I was visiting the city
                    he had walked a number of miles that morning to meet me, and thank me personally
                    for the kindness he received from my family when, as one of Jenkins' privates,
                    he was on the sick list and was cared for in my barn. It seems like the irony of
                    fate that this same command, under the lead of McCausland, who became its
                    commander after Jenkins fell, burnt the town of Chambersburg only one year
                    later, including the barn where its sick had been ministered to, and the house
                    where Jenkins received generous hospitality while he made it his headquarters.</p>
<p>Jenkins' command did not destroy much property. There was little left in the
                    country that was useful to the army, as stores were empty of goods, banks
                    without money, and farmers generally without horses or cattle. His first order
                    required all persons in the town possessing arms, whether guns or pistols, to
                    bring them to the front of the court house within two hours, and the penalty for
                    disobedience was that all who refused would expose their houses to search, and
                    make them lawful objects of plunder. A number of guns and pistols were brought
                    and delivered to him, but few of them were considered of sufficient value to be
                    retained by the soldiers.</p>
<p>Early in the morning of the 17th of June Jenkins ordered the stores and shops to
                    be opened for two hours to enable his men to purchase such goods as they
                    desired, all of which were to be paid for, but, of course,  in
                    Confederate money. The order was obeyed to the extent of opening the stores and
                    shops, but as most of them were nearly or entirely empty, there was little
                    traffic. There were odds and ends of valueless stock not deemed of sufficient
                    value to ship away, but the Confederate customers cleaned out the remnants and
                    paid liberal prices in Confederate money that was printed by the army as it
                    moved along. Jenkins then withdrew his force and fell back to Greencastle, and
                    spent four days in that rich portion of Franklin County, gathering in all the
                    property that could be made useful to the army. On the 22d Jenkins' raid ended,
                    and on that day he rejoined the advance of Lee's infantry between Greencastle
                    and Hagerstown, when the invasion of Lee's army in force began.</p>
<p>About ten o'clock on the morning of the 23d, Jenkins cavalry returned to
                    Chambersburg as the advance of the infantry that was closely following him.
                    Ewell's corps was in the advance, and made liberal requisitions upon Greencastle
                    on the 23d, and on the 24th it entered the town of Chambersburg to the music of
                    the "Bonnie Blue Flag."</p>
<p>Many requisitions were made by Ewell upon the citizens of Chambersburg, all of
                    which were impossible of fulfilment, as all valuables that could be removed had
                    been sent away. One of the most amusing features of his several requisitions was
                    a demand for the immediate delivery of nine barrels of sauerkraut. He knew that
                    sauerkraut was regarded as a very valuable antiscorbutic, and as some of his
                    troop suffered from scurvy because of their unwholesome rations, he assumed that
                    sauerkraut would be an invaluable remedy for those who were threatened with that
                    malady. He was quite incredulous at first, when informed that sauerkraut was a
                    commodity that could not be kept in midsummer, and that such a thing was  unknown even in the German communities where sauerkraut was one of
                    the great staples of the table. If there had been a barrel of sauerkraut in
                    Chambersburg in midsummer he could have scented it any place within a square,
                    and he finally abandoned that feature of the requisition when told that it was
                    not an article that could be concealed in hot weather.</p>
<p>Ewell paid me the usual compliment of all commanders of both armies who visited
                    Chambersburg, of taking possession of my large field for his camp and of a
                    nearby Dunkard church for his headquarters, while subordinate officers occupied
                    my house. During the week or ten days in which a portion or the whole of his
                    command was there encamped, the most scrupulous care was taken to prevent the
                    destruction of any private property whatever. Lee issued a general order
                    forbidding that any private property should be taken by the army, excepting by
                    an authorized officer, and loose foraging was not only forbidden, but severely
                    punished. It is due to General Lee and his army to say that the order against
                    the wanton destruction of property was generously obeyed by his infantry.</p>
<p>An interesting incident occurred that showed how Lee himself was inclined to
                    temper the sorrows and sacrifices of war. Chambersburg depended wholly upon the
                    surrounding country for its daily supplies of flour, vegetables and meats, and
                    as all teams had been sent away and no supplies could be brought in, it required
                    only a very few days to bring the people of the town to a state of starvation.
                    The mills were all in the possession of the enemy and run to their utmost
                    capacity to furnish supplies for the army, and Mrs. William McLellan, whose
                    husband was one of the leading members of the bar and my law partner, decided to
                    make a personal visit to General Lee, who had his headquarters in Shetter's
                    woods, only several  squares distant from Mrs. McLellan's residence.
                    She was promptly admitted to his presence and appealed to him to permit supplies
                    to be brought in to the people of the town without being seized by his army. Lee
                    promptly arranged with her to have sufficient supplies of flour furnished to the
                    people, and after his generous order she thanked him and asked him for his
                    autograph, to which he replied: "Do you want the autograph of a rebel?" Mrs.
                    McLellan said: "General Lee, I am a true Union woman and yet I ask for bread and
                    for your autograph." His answer was: "It is to your interest to be for the Union
                    and I hope you may be as firm in your purpose as I am in mine." He gave her the
                    autograph and Mrs. McLellan brought bread to her starving neighbors, and among
                    her most cherished relics during her life was her autograph of Robert E.
                Lee.</p>
