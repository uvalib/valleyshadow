                <p>Incidents of Lee's Invasion As Written By W. A. Reed for the Greencastle Press
                    June 22, 1886</p>
                <p>Greencastle in the Confederate Lines Without Soldiers or Aid of Any Kind to
                    Oppose the Men Lately Led by Stonewall Jackson</p>
                <p>Twenty years is an age when as a young man we attempt to look forward, but, when
                    we come to look back, how short it is! We will attempt in a few paragraphs to
                    glance back to 1863, when "war's rude blast was heard', in these vales. It is
                    difficult to bring up to the memory all the moving incidents and accidents of
                    that period, and we ask reader's indulgence for errors and omissions.</p>
                <p>In looking at "The Pilot" (the only paper <orig reg="issued">issed</orig> in
                    Greencastle at that time) of June 9, 1863, we read: "It was reported in
                    Cincinnati, on Friday, that General Johnson is marching upon Mhiis. Advice
                    from General Grant (Vicksburg) assure the government that the <orig reg="siege"
                        >seige</orig> is progressing favorably. The fall of this Rebel Gibraltar is
                    near at hand." In the local news we notice the report of the <orig reg="Ladies'"
                        >Ladies's</orig> Aid Society of Greencastle, showing the hospital stores
                    sent to the Christian Commission at Philadelphia. Mr. S. H. Eby still conducts
                    his News and Periodical establishment in the post office room. <abbr
                        expan="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> T. G. Apple's congregation met on Sunday to
                    celebrate the ter-centenary of the (German) Reformed church. The choir sang most
                    beautifully "A Hundred Years to Come." Jacob Shook, esq, is enrolling officer.
                    "Corn and locust blossoms" tell the meaning of the old sign. Our poetical
                    assistant (for we were them the chief writer on the Pilot) goes off into
                    rhapsodies over "June, the fairest month of all the year. The caroling of birds,
                    the rippling of brooks, the balmy zephyrs, all invite us to enjoy the beauties-"
                    Surely all is quiet on the Conococheague. But how soon the change! A fortnight!
                    "The rebels are coming!" 'Ah, it is the same old story." "No, not quite," said a
                    voice near by, they are coming." This was Sunday, June 14. In less than 15
                    minutes it had spread over town. Bad news always travels fast, you know. Evening
                    came, but it was not the quiet, holy Sabbath evening, such as we used to know,
                    when the family circle was brought together and recited the Westminster
                    catechism and engaged it services befitting the day. No: on this evening such
                    things were forgotten. The people were stirred up, or, to speak moderately, they
                    were excited You could hear the hammer of the merchant engaged in packing up his
                    goods. In a little while side walks were filled with boxes and the shippers
                    impatiently "waiting for the wagon" to transport their merchandise to the
                    railroad. Then came horses, wagons, carriages, with a retinue of drivers, riders
                    and skedaddlers. Virginia refugees, too, were not few in number; their stories,
                    too, were listened to by vast crowds; their tales of rebels, dangers, escapes
                    and "accidents by flood and field," were, as, usual, moving, we wouldn't say
                    without foundation, or, like Wright's Pills, sugar coated, that the victim-the
                    patient we mean-may swallow them more readily. Ye 'contraband" heard the news,
                    The "intelligent" and those otherwise felt the magic of the word "skedaddle."
                    Black faces, blue gingham, linsey woolsey, gay cloth, huge bundles, and cooking
                    utensils were all seen making their exit out the borough limits, steering for a
                    place of safety just "furder norf." The cars were too slow for traveling just
                    then, so they "took it afoot,"</p>
                <p>The foregoing is an extract from an article in the Pilot (July 26 1864)
                    describing an incident about a year later than Lee's invasion, but it is just as
                    true of June 1863. Our memory readily, <orig reg="confirms">confirme</orig> it.
                    On that Sunday evening <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr> J. Gilmore Rowe
                    went to Williamsport on his little black pony we knew so well, and made a <orig
                        reg="reconnaissance">reconnoisance</orig> in person. His return was eagerly
                    waited for; his intelligence was quietly given, and we expected the foe. The
                    morning came, goods were hastily packed and horses sent away, but Monday evening
                        <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Jenkins made his first appearance his
                    troopers made a spirited dash for the water station, expecting to capture the
                    freight train, but the engineer got his train off just in time to save it.
                    "Hudibras" wrote:-</p>
                <p>"Do you remember, reader,<lb/> The evening the rebs came here?<lb/> They came in

                <p>Jenkins spent the week in visiting Chambersburg and other points in the county,
                    taking horses and cattle and pillaging stores. Sunday he set apart for "looting"
                    the stores in Greencastle. The merchants then in business were <abbr

                    >Co</abbr>, where they now re-<pb n="2"/>mains: A. L. Irwin's hardware store in
                    what is now known as the Rhodes building; Prather &amp; Krens, where J. Adam
                    Carl has his family grocery; S H. Prather &amp; <abbr expan="Company"

                    >Co.</abbr>, in Mrs. Fleck's house. All these places and others were visited by
                    the chivalry. Such good as would suit them they took and what they could not
                    take they injured or wantonly destroyed. The plunder Jenkins's men carried south
                    on the Williamsport turnpike road. But in the early gray of the next morning
                    more alarming news came in, and the strains of martial music gave notice
                    of-General Ewell's Advance.</p>
                <p>There remained nothing for the citizens to do but to accept the situation and
                    become for a while citizens of the Confederacy. There were no arms, <orig
                        reg="there">their</orig> were no soldiers to oppose the men until lately led
                    by "Stonewall" Jackson. It was nearly noon when Jenkins, chosen to lead on
                    account of his knowledge of the country <orig reg="gleaned">gleamed</orig> from
                    a week's raiding through our country, reached the town, and marched out the
                    Chambersburg road. Hearing that a body of Federal troops was somewhere in the
                    vicinity, artillery was placed in position, on Shook's hill to the west and in a
                    field to the right. Jenkin's cavalry then pushed forward, and when a few hundred
                    yards beyond Fleming's. <abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Boyd's company of the
                    1st New York Lincoln cavalry came out from the little woods then standing on the
                    right of the road and making a gallant charge the Virginians fell back toward
                    the main column. The Federals were unable to drive them further, for, when the
                    artillery opened upon them and numerous infantry rose up in the wheat field like
                    the clan of Rhoderick Dhu they could drive the Johnnies no further but,
                    undismayed, the Federals fired boldly into the ranks of the enemy, and, learning
                    the <orig reg="strength">strenth</orig> and situation of the southern troops,
                    withdrew again to the woods. They were <orig reg="not">dot</orig> pursued,
                    because Jenkins doubtless thought it was a <orig reg="feint">faint</orig> and
                    that a larger force was certainly behind them. Mr. Hoke, in his "Reminiscence of
                    the War," states upon the authority of D. K. Appenzellar, who was captured that
                    morning by a scouting party, that they were informed that <abbr expan="General"
                        >Gen.</abbr> Couch was on his way south from Harrisburg with a force of
                    20,000 men. The boldness of this charge doubtless confirmed them in the belief
                    that the report was true. Under cover of the woods the feasibility of another
                    attack was discussed and some impatient spirits, unable longer to contain
                    themselves, rushed out with Sergeant Cafferty to make another onset. This time
                    they lead not proceeded far when Cafferty was shot through the leg, and young</p>
                <p>Corporal William H. Rhial Fell</p>
                <p>mortally wounded. Cafferty was paroled and received into the hospitable home of
                    George Ilginfritz and was kindly cared for until he was ready for duty. He is
                    expected here to-day, a living witness of that day's charge. Rhial was buried in
                    a shallow grave, and in a few days afterward <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr>
                    David Detrich and Jere. Detrich, with the assistance of citizens, took up the
                    remains and buried them in the Lutheran graveyard with appropriate services by
                        <abbr expan="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> John Rebaugh and <abbr expan="Reverend"
                        >Rev.</abbr> E. Breidenbaugh. <abbr expan="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Rebaugh
                    never officiated at a funeral afterwards. Rhial was but a lad, born in
                    Philadelphia, and joined Company C, raised by <abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr>
                    W. H. Boyd, also of Philadelphia. The 1st <abbr expan="New York">N. Y.</abbr>
                    Lincoln Cavalry had peen raised for the purpose of being the President's body
                    guard, and it was expected that the Eastern States would each furnish a company,
                    but New York filled all the companies except two, one from Michigan and the
                    other Company C-here mentioned.</p>

                    Chambersburg and Greencastle we encountered a scouting party sent out by
                    Jenkins, and sending word from advance guard, which I commanded, back to <abbr

                    closed up on the advance and we drove them several miles until just near the
                    edge of Greencastle, at a large white <orig reg="house">horse</orig>; we were

                    erect a suitable monument to the-First Union Soldier Killed In Battle<lb/> on
                    the free soil of Pennsylvania. As an historic incident it deserves to be
                    perpetuated, and his fellow soldiers this duty as they are reminded of the many
                    dangers they have passed, and in remembrance of the glorious causes of freedom
                    and union, will drop a tear at his grave. And when the last soldier shall have
                    been placed under the <orig reg="clouds">clods</orig> of the valley, may the
                    memory of Rhial and fellow soldiers of the Union long live in the hearts of
                    every American citizen.</p>
