                <p>S. T. Shank, of North River, <abbr expan="Virginia">Va.</abbr>, has consented to
                    give an interesting event of the great war of which very little is known:</p>
                <p>I was a sergeant in <abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> McClanahan's Battery,
                        <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> J. D. Imboden's Command, and we had just
                    returned to Virginia, after <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Early's near
                    approach to the Federal capital in August, 1864, in which campaign two of our
                    guns had taken part. The section was in command of <abbr expan="Lieutenant"
                        >Lieut.</abbr> Carter Berkeley, of Staunton, <abbr expan="Virginia"
                    >Va.</abbr> In an engagement with the enemy a few days before, near Leesburg,
                        <abbr expan="Virginia">Va.</abbr>, we had burst the barrel of one of our
                    guns. This was ordered to be taken to Staunton, and, as that was the home of our
                    lieutenant, he accompanied the disabled gun, leaving me in command of the other
                    gun. We were now in the lower valley, in Clark County, <abbr expan="Virginia"
                        >Va.</abbr>, near the Shenandoah river and the town of Berryville.</p>
                <p>On the morning that <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr> Berkeley was to start
                    to Staunton an order was received for a commissioned officer and one gun to
                    report to <abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Long, of the Sixty-Second Virginia
                    Infantry, at Berry's Ferry for guard duty. <abbr expan="Lieutenant"
                    >Lieut.</abbr> Berkeley told the officers in command that I could fill the
                    place, as there would be nothing to do but lie around the ferry during the day.
                    So he started to Staunton and I to the place designated, reaching there about 8
                    A.M. We were on the west side of the river, which is flanked by a low ridge of
                    hills. The road to the ferry passes through a deep ravine of this ridge.
                    Arriving here, I found that the enemy had thrown a skirmish line across the
                    river, which had advanced as far as the entrance to this ravine, and had just
                    been driven back by our pickets, which consisted of only a few detachments of
                    infantry, possibly in all one hundred men. I reported at once to <abbr
                        expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Long, and he told me to select a position, and
                    do the best I could. This was the only order I received during the day. I took
                    my gun to the top of the hill on the south side of the ravine, adn there had an
                    opportunity for using it most effectively. On the opposite side of the river,
                    about a mile distant, there was a stretch of bottom land literally covered with
                    troops just in the act of crossing the river by wading. In a moment we brought
                    our gun into position, and threw shells into their very midst as rapidly as we
                    could, until they sought shelter. During this time we had all in our own hands,
                    as we were too far off to be reached with their smaller arms, and their
                    artillery, it seems, had not arrived. In a short time, however, they had a
                    battery of six rifle guns in position, and opened fire on us at such a distance
                    that we could not reach at all with our howitzer. As we could do no effective
                    work for a while, we left the gun in position and retired behind the brow of the
                    hill for protection. Their firing continued for some time, and whenever their
                    infantry or cavalry would become visible I alone would load and fire our gun,
                    not wishing to expose more than one man at a time. One or two others did this
                    after me. After some time I inferred from their movements that they were
                    preparing to charge across the river with their cavalry and capture our gun,
                    thus opening the way for their army to cross over.</p>
                <p>We then drew our gun by hand, not wishing to expose our horses, below the crest
                    of the hill, limbered up and moved several hundred yards to the right, placed in
                    position without being seen by the enemy, and awaited developments. We had not
                    long to wait, for soon the anticipated charge was made through the placid waters
                    of the Shenandoah, and on through our feeble line of infantry, out through the
                    ravine, then wheeled to the left up the ridge and over the very ground our gun
                    had occupied all morning. Then at a short distance on their right we began
                    firing, using first the shell with which the gun was loaded and then canister.
                    We fired so rapidly into their midst that very few of them were able to recross
                    the river to their friends. As soon as all this was over I went to where they
                    had passed, and where our gun had been. Two men, whose horses had been shot,
                    were crouching under some bushes like frightened birds. I walked up to them
                    wholly unarmed and demanded their arms. They deliberately unbuckled their belts,
                    and gave me two new Colt's army revolvers, which had never been fired, and forty
                    round of cartridges. I gave one of those pistols to the first one of our boys
                    who asked for it. The other I gave to the person who afterwards became my wife,
                    and we have it yet as a momento of the war.</p>
                <p>This was the last effort made to cross the river, and it may be said practically
                    that one howitzer prevented an entire brigade of infantry, a battalion of
                    cavalry, and a battery of six guns from making that crossing. We remained upon
                    the hill until night, then were relieved by others sent to our assistance.</p>
                <p><abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Imboden, who had been captain of a battery in
                    the Mexican war, and had commanded the same battery the first year of our war,
                    came on the field that evening and rode a portion of the way to camp with me. He
                    was highly complimentary, and said that he had never seen anything to equal the
                    valor and sagacity displayed by us that day. He also complimented me very
                    highly, as did <abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Long and other officers. <abbr
                        expan="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr> Berkeley wrote to the department asking for
                    a commission for me, but it never came. Of course I felt very much gratified
                    over all this, for I was only a boy. I was doing only my plain duty. I have
                    never seen this episode in history, and have no idea what troops were opposing
                    us. As our battery was made up of boys from many different States and, in many
                    instances, remote sections, I rarely see any of my old comrades. The other day I
                    met six of them at Staunton, whom I had not seen since April 9, 1865. I was much
                    impressed with the change time had wrought in their appearance. We had parted as
                    boys, and then met as gray-haired veterans.</p>
