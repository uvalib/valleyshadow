<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> Description of life in Greencastle while it was occupied by the Confederate army
                    in June 1864.</p>
<p>As civilization has no perminent home in this life
                    but comes and goes with the ages leaving in course of time no living witness of
                    human events we deem it a duty to keep the reading public and especially the
                    readers of Kauffmans Progressive News is touch with the history of the late
                    Civil War as acted out in Greencastle.</p>
<p>It is taken from the files of The Pilot a weekly Greencastle publication under
                    the ownership and control of the late James McCrory who conducted it from
                    January 15, 1861 to July 16, 1864 and is the only authentic account in
                    existence.</p>
<p>The events as they transpired were written not on the impulse of the moment but
                    after at least a weeks consideration and comparison of
                    notes with other witnesses of the scenes. There was no need of putting a thrill
                    in the news or enlarging upon it. It had all the thrill the citizens were
                    looking for and then some. The facts were gathered and compiled as we herewith
                    give them, word for word as recorded.</p>
<p>The facts as given are often called for by tourists, strangers and new comers to
                    the town as well as school children in search of local history as related to
                    this community. It should be ready information on the tongues of all as there is
                    no excuse for any citizen not being familiar with the history of the town,
                    especially Lee's invasion which occurred June 1863, just 64 years ago this month
                    and which was followed by the battle of Gettysburg July 1, 2 and 3, which
                    terminated in defeat for the Confederate army and broke the backbone of the
                    rebellion.</p>
<p>For weeks we had been constantly told by the daily press that the Rebel Army,
                    under General Lee, intended to invade the North.-But so accustomed were we to
                    rumors of this kind, that no attention was paid to the warning. Many thought it
                    very probable that the Confederates might make the attempt. Some hooted at the
                    idea of such a thing, while others said, "let them come, and they will find
                    force enough to check them before they tread the "free soil" of Pennsylvania."
                    So, from one reason or another, no timely preparation was made. All thought that
                    if such undertaking was really contemplated by Gen.
                    Lee that, in an event, his cohorts could not be precipitated upon us ere we were
                    aware of it. It took Longstreet almost a week, in September, 1862, to march from
                    Frederick City, Md., to Hagerstown; and surely the
                    army of Gen. Lee could not leave Culpepper and reach the Potomac before we were aware
                    of it. The sequel tells another tale.</p>
<p>On the evening of Sabbath, June 14, 1863, we heard that Gen. Milroy had been threatened by a superior force, at Winchester,
                        Va., and that the United States troops had
                    been driven out of Martinsburg. The affair seemed inexplicable, and many chose
                    to disbelieve the story. On the morning of the day (Monday) a large number of
                    wagons belonging to the wagon train of Milroy, passed through town at a furious
                    rate. The teamsters were evidently in a most woeful "panic," and said the Rebels
                    were just in their rear, and that they had been fired into on this side of the
                    river. Despite the former indifference of our citizens, the panic some how
                    became contagious. The merchants, who had already began to pack up their goods,
                    hurried still more, and made banner and nails fly faster than ever.-Horses were
                    run off to the country to places of fancied security. Good housewives, too, were
                    in great agitation and bustle. They were alarmed lest the Rebels might burn and
                    destroy and what were they to do with their furniture, bedding and wearing
                    apparel? It was a puzzle, truly. Non came and with it a
                    detachment of the First New York Cavalry under Capt. Boyd, which had succeededin
                    getting away from Winchester, and protested the rear of the wagon train spoken
                    of above. An hour more and the Rebels had not yet appeared.-The people grew
                    cooler. Some thought that Milroy had been frightened. At all events, the foe
                    would not cross the Potomac. Affairs reminded in
                    state quo for a few hours more.-At 6 o'clock, P. M., one of our citizens who had
                    ridden to watch the appoach of the invaders, came in
                    in hot haste, his steed covered with foam and quivering in every limb from the
                    great speed at which it had been compelled to travel. This citizens had reported that he had got into the advance at the State
                    Line-had talked to officers and men-told them he lived in the vicinity of
                    Middleburg, and was allowed to turn off at a by-road, by which means he
                    succeeded including them, and got to the place just in time to give the
                    telegraph operator and other officials an opportunity to make good their escape.
                    The New York Cavalry knowing their own force to be too small to offer
                    resistance, wheeled and left. In a few minutes, Gen. Jenkins's Western Virginia Cavalry dashed into town, and finding
                    the coast clear, commenced their pleasant task of searching stables, and taking
                    there from all the horses they could find. Their stay on this occasion, hardly
                    exceeded an hour. We were confident then that it was only a raid for plunder. We
                    lay down to sleep, and our slumbers were disturbed by visions of Jenkins and his
                    men.-Morning dawned and small squads of cavalry were dashing up and down the
                    streets. It was ascertained that the gang had spread out in all directions,
                    securing the country for horses.-They had taken possession of Chamberburg. A couple of their messengers were
                    captured by some civilians of Waynesboro; and taken to that place. In the
                    afternoon of this day, (Tuesday) a lot of "contrabands," about thirty in number,
                    under charge of a Chaplain and three or four other soldiers on their way to
                    Hagerstown, were captured by a crowd of people near East Baltimore street. The
                    darkies were liberated, and the Chaplain and soldiers sent toward Waynesboro.
                    This created a wonderful excitement. In the evening a number of citizens sighed a paper, protesting against the proceedings, and
                    presented it to a Rebel Colonel(-,) who desired to know what had become of the
                    missing men.-The next day the captured Rebels were released and brought back.
                    The Chaplain demanded $50,000 in lieu of the contrabands; and in case this was
                    not complied with, the town should certainly be burned. Two horses were given to
                    make up the money. Every one knew the money could not be made np, so many of the citizes commenced to
                    remove valuables, in anticipation of the "burning." The allowed time passed, and
                    the money was not forth coming-and the town was not burned. In the evening the
                    main body, under Jenkins, retreated towards Hagerstown with a large number of
                    horses, wagons and plunder. That same night we believe two hundred and fifty
                    men, under Gov.Furguson, went to M'Conellsburg and
                    captured horses, &amp;c. We congratulated ourselves
                    that evening upon the termination of the "raid." The next morning, however,
                    about 10 o'clock A. M., as some hands were employed in repairing the telegraph
                    line, a sudden dash was made into town, and the hand car and hands captured, but
                    were soon after released. Each succeeding day of the week witnessed a repetition
                    of former scenes. Capturing horses was all the go. Indeed it seemed as if these
                    men possessed some sort of peculiar instinct in finding horses which were
                    concealed in the most secret places. They found tickets, dales and secret places
                    which few of our people could find without being shown thither. Yet these men
                    had no guides, at least none of the citizens of this township. The success of
                    these horse dealers was amazing.</p>
<p>On Sabbath, June 21st, was chosen by Ferguson's gang to make a systematic pilaging of the stores. In some of the stores, a
                    great quanity of goods were destroyed. The order
                    given by an Artillery Captain, in front of S. H. P. &amp; Co's store, was
                    ordered to "dismount and ramsack the store." Mr. Riley's store had, a day or two
                    previously, suffered heavily by these men. The losses it is impossible now to
                    state. If it had not been that our merchants had a portion of their stock sent
                    East, there would have been a clean sweep made.</p>
<p>Maj. Paxton took possession of the warehouses, and
                    loaded the Confederate States wagons with flour grain &amp;c.</p>
<p>Evening came, and this delectable job was over for the present.</p>
<p>The following morning, (Monday June 22,) Gen.
                    Jenkin's Cavalry made their appearance, announcing themselves as the advance
                    guard of Gen. Rhodes Division of Ewell's Corps said
                    to be close at hand. Gen. Jenkin's troop having
                    passed through, his advance was attacked by forty three Union Cavalrymen, a
                    detachment of the First New York-Capt. Boyd-and
                    driven back at full speed upon his main force, a mile north of town, when the
                    Rebels who had ambushed in the wheat field to retreat. In this, the first
                    engagement that took place on Pennsylvania soil, the Rebels lost two killed,</p>
<p>Sergeant Rhil, Company C, New York Cavalry, was killed, and Sergeant Cafforty
                    wounded in the leg. The body of the former was buried by the Rebels in a shallow
                    grave, having first been stripped of hat, shoes and coat buttons. A few days
                    afterwards he was disintered, placed in a neat
                    coffin and accompained by a large concourse of
                    citizens, was buried in the Lutheran graveyard of this place Sergt. Rhil was the first man who poured his life's
                    blood, and fell a bleeding sacrifice upon his country's altar, in the State of
                    Pennsylvania. Let his name be numbered down among her honored ones, and be
                    handed down to remote posterity!-Sergeant Cafferty was removed to the residence
                    of Mr. George Ilginfritz, where his wounds were dressed and where he received
                    the kind attentions of the family and citizens.</p>
<p>Gen.Rhode's division
                    encamped on the 22d, in the vicinity of the town. His headquarters were in the
                    field belonging to Rev. J. Loose. Col. Willis of the 19th Georgia Reg., was appointed Provost Marshall, assisted by
                    Captain Carson and the Adjutant. To the guards from this regiment, and to the
                    officers, and men, credit must be given for the good order maintained.</p>
<p>On the 24th of June, General Rhodes' Division left here and marched direct to
                    Chambersburg, with the excep-tion of one division under
                    command of Gen. Stuart, (infantry,) which went
                    there via Mercersburg, M'Connellsburg, and
                    Loudon. Gen. Stuart's Division arrived in
                    Mercersburg about 12 o'clock, M., and at once made itself at home, understanding
                    a Theological Seminary was located there, placed a guard around the property for
                    its protection, forbade soldiers from entering its grounds or the homes of
                    citizens, under penalty of severe punishment. They ordered the stores to be
                    opened, declaring that they wanted the articles, and would have them. To their
                    credit it must be said every thing was done by them in an orderly manner. No
                    pillaging by soldiers was permitted. What they took was taken by appointed
                    officers, who made bills out, and paid in Confederate Script. Maj. Goldsboro', of Baltimore, was Provost Marshall. He
                    has since been killed in the battle of Gettysburg.</p>
<p>General Rhode's Division was followed by that of General Johnson. General Early's
                    Corps, of the same division, however, went by way of Waynesboro and Gettysburg
                    to York.</p>
<p>On the 24th, General Ewell passed through town closed in a carriage, and closely
                    examining a map. He appeared pale and delicate.</p>
<p>On the 26th, General Anderson's Division, of Gen.
                    Hill's was with them. Two divisions of the corps went to Waynesboro.'</p>
<p>On the 27th General Longstreet's Corps went through. His was the largest and most
                    destructive set of men. His whole route was marked by destruction.</p>
<p>To General M'Laws was reserved the honor of
                        cutting down the Union Pole, which had been left standing
                    by preceding forces.-During the night of this day,   Fitzhugh Lee's Cavalry
                    passed through.</p>
<p>The Rebel force that passed through town was estimated at about 50,000 or 60,000
                    men, accompanied by 192 pieces of ordinance. The force that went by way of
                    Waynesboro', it is said, numbered between 20,000 or 40,000 makig a total force of about 90,000 or 100,000.</p>
<p>The following requisitions were made upon the Authorities, during the stay of
                    Ewell's Corps.</p>
<p>Headquarters 2d. Army Corps<br> June 23d, 1863</p>
<p>To the Authorities of Greencastle:</p>
<p>By direction of Major General R. S. Ewell, I make requisitions for the following
                    articles:</p>
<p>100 saddles and bridles, 12 pistols</p>
<p>These articles are to be furnished at 2 o'clock P. M.</p>
<p>J. A. Harmon.<br>Maj. and Ch. Q. M., 2d Corps de Armie.</p>
<p>Soon after another requisition was sent in for onions, sourkrout, potatoes, radishes, &amp;c.,
                    and signed by A. M. Mitchell, Maj. and Ch. Com.</p>
<p>Then followed one, demanding<br> 2000 pounds of lard, 1000 pounds of leather,
                    100 pistols, 12 boxes of tin, 300 curry combs and brushes.<br> (Signed) Wm.
                    Allen, M and C.</p>
<p>The chief of Topographical Engneers demanded two
                    maps of Franklin county.</p>
<p>These demands were so heavy that the Council felt it impossible to fill them. The
                    Rebels got a few saddles and bridles, and some vegetables, about town.</p>
<p>They seized and carried away about $2000 worth of leather from Mr. Stiffel.</p>
<p>Fitzhugh Lee, wanted to find the authorities, to make requsitions for commissary stores, but hearing the "Yanks' were
                    close upon his heels; he did not take time to hunt up the Council. He declared
                    it was the strangest place he ever saw, nobody seemed to know who the members
                    were.</p>
