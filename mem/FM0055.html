<h3 class="section-head">Franklin County: "The Lesson of Our Civil War," by A. K. McClure,
                            June 16, 1886</h3>
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> In this lecture before the literary societies of Washington and Lee University,
                    A. K. McClure, McClure describes the origins of the Civil War as the conflict in
                    vision between Jefferson and Washington, while slavery played a role only as an
                    obvious expression of the deeper conflict.</p>
<p>
                    <u>Gentlemen of the Literary Societies of Washington and Lee
                        University:</u>
                </p>
<p>Do not shudder at the theme I have chosen. I do not come to criticise the past, or to speak to those of the past. There are deep
                    wounds not yet wholly healed; there are fierce passions which, though enfeebled,
                    have not perished; there are bereavements whose shadows linger in countless
                    homes; and there are sorrows which are tempered by time, but not effaced. I come
                    to speak to a new generation, to which we, who witnessed our great civil
                    conflict, must soon give place. I do so because I address young men, most of
                    whom were not born when Appomattox became historic, and young men who, by reason
                    of their better opportunities and attainments, are to be teachers and leaders
                    when the memorable names of the war shall be known only in the exceptionally
                    grand, and thrilling history whose annals they have made illustrious.</p>
<p>There is no history or tradition of man that does not tell of civil war. Even the
                    chosen people of God, led by His own appointed lawgiver-fed, guided, and rescued
                    by miracle-were made wanderers in the wilder-ness by secession and
                    fraternal dispute; and, when in possession of the promised land, the tribes of
                    Judah and Israel plunged into bloody conflict. Thus, through all the strange
                    mutations of ancient and modern national structures, every civilization has
                    carved out its destiny with the battle-axe and sword, and chiefly by internecine
                    war. It was the natural employment of the barbarian. As a better civilization
                    dawned, wars often multiplied until they blotted out the grandest monuments they
                    had erected; and the history of every great nation of to-day has for its foundation the arbitrament of sanguinary battle. Our
                    own republic was deeply crimsoned with the blood of its founders, and it was
                    through the deadly struggle of mother and son of proud Britain that the noblest
                    government of earth was created.</p>
<p>But the civil wars of other countries and civilizations bear no analogy to the
                    two great internecine conflicts which the American people have made memorable.
                    The wars of the ancients were wars of ambition, of conquest, of robbery. All
                    that is immortal in Roman or Grecian or Carthaginian history, where we read of
                    popular rule-all the wonderful temples, triumphal arches, and other monuments of
                    antiquity, and even the later achievements commemorated by the imposing columns
                    of modern art, as a rule, proclaim how history has repeated itself in all ages,
                    by wars of ambition. Every great nationality of the past was rocked in the
                    tempest of civil conflict; every civilization of the present has bloody pages of
                    fraternal strife, and there is no more thrilling record of sanguinary internal
                    struggle than that  of England, the accepted fountain of the best
                    civilization the world has known. The right of might is the sole title to every
                    monarch's sceptre in the Old World, and that tells the whole story.</p>
<p>But history is among your collegiate studies; and, with the strange conflicts and
                    mutations of living, languishing, and perished nationalities, you are familiar.
                    Let us deal with what is least taught in colleges, and what is most needed to be
                    learned by students-our country and ourselves.</p>
<p>You are told, by many inconsiderate political writers and orators, that our late
                    civil war was the creation of extremists in both sections: of Northern
                    abolitionists and Southern fire-eaters; that they inflamed the people beyond the
                    bounds of reason; that they precipitated North and South into causeless war. It
                    is not so. They aided and hastened the conflict, just as the driftwood of the
                    resistless current adds to its momentum. They were only the white-caps of the
                    often angry surface-waves which betokened the restless unfathomable deep. They
                    were seen and heard by all, while the profound unrest that flung them up to play
                    fantastic parts was unnoted and unappreciated.</p>
<p>It is a reproach to American intelligence and heroism to assume that mere
                    sectional agitators could lead the most peace-loving, the most cultivated, and
                    the most prosperous people of the earth into the bloodiest war of modern
                    history. No: there were rational causes arising from sincerest conviction, which
                    became too great for adjustment by statesmanship, and war came because of  irreconcilable dispute on problems which defied solution by the
                    methods of peace. It is easy to present many plausible theories by which the
                    conflict between the North and the South could have been averted; but those who
                    thus theorize do not understand the best attributes of American citizenship.
                    There were statesmen and soldiers who welcomed war, but they were rare
                    exceptions. There was not a great soldier, of either North or South, who did not
                    draw his sword with painful reluctance: there was not a great statesman, in
                    either section, who did not profoundly deplore the resort to arms. I saw tears
                    jewel the eyes of Winfield Scott, the morning after the surrender of Fort
                    Sumter, as he stood in the President's room and looked across the Potomac to his
                    mother commonwealth. "I fear Virginia-I fear Virginia," was the sad and
                    tremulous exclamation of the hero of two wars, and the great Captain of the Age.
                    I then, for the first time, understood how deep and implacable were the opposing
                    convictions of allegiance, when State and Nation gave opposing commands.</p>
<p>Let me say to the young men before me, who must learn of the great civil struggle
                    of their fathers from the pages of history, that, to be just to their country
                    and their countrymen, they must intelligently and dispassionately search beneath
                    the partisan and sectional rubbish of the day, for the rational causes and the
                    logical results of the most heroic conflict of either ancient or modern times.</p>
<p>Will it startle you to be told that the germ of discord, that ripened into civil
                    war after two generations had nourished it, was planted by the two most
                    illustrious men of our history? They were George Washington and Thomas
                    Jefferson: men who made the grandest records of unsullied patriotism, of
                    loftiest heroism, of wisest statesmanship. They differed widely, radically, as
                    to the true theory of popular government Washington believed in a strong
                    centralized government, Jefferson believed in the supreme power of the people;
                    and the conflicts between the elder Adams and Jefferson surpassed even the
                    intense partisan asperities of the present time.</p>
<p>Had either Washington or Jefferson defined the basis and powers of our
                    government, there never could have been an issue between State and Nation, with
                    color of law; but they created the issue, in all the integrity of their
                    matchless devotion to the republic, and neither was able to solve the problem.
                    Could they have foreseen the fierce sectional struggle over Missouri in 1820,
                    that brought the country to the very verge of dissolution, or the
                    "nullification" disturbance of 1831, or the Kansas-Nebraska tempest, that raged
                    from 1854 to 1860, or the fearful climax that was reached in 1861, they would
                    have left no such issue to convulse the people to whom they had given free
                    government. They not only could not forecast the future magnitude of the
                    question, but they could not control the discordant and almost chaotic elements
                    of the country in the formation of a permanent government. The Confederation of
                         1781, the firstborn governmental structure of the Union, was
                    fruitful chiefly in demoralization and the lack of government. Although
                    impoverished by war, and without currency or credit, extravagance and a growing
                    disrespect for authority prevailed throughout the land. A government that would
                    govern became a supreme necessity; and it is wonderful that, with the honest
                    antagonisms of the ablest and best men of the day, and the power of the
                    demagogues-who were potential then as now-so beneficent a structure of
                    constitutional government was finally attained in 1789.</p>
<p>Had the Constitution been any less a succession of compromises, it would have
                    been rejected; and it was by the supreme necessity of compromise, even to the
                    extent of ambiguous definition of what later proved to be most vital questions,
                    that an acceptable fundamental law was framed. Opposing partisans, failing to
                    obtain the plain command of the Constitution in harmony with their views, at
                    once claimed by construction what they had failed to obtain in indisputable
                    terms. From the day of the adoption of the Constitution and the organization of
                    the government, the sovereignty of the State as against the Nation, and the
                    sovereignty of the Nation as against the State, were both taught with equal
                    ability and earnestness, and the high warrant of the fundamental law was claimed
                    with equal positiveness by the disputing statesmen.</p>
<p>Vital as the issue was regarded by the leading founders of the republic, it grew
                    into paramount importance as the interests of sections became more and more  involved. Slavery was accepted as warranted by the common law of the
                    country, as there were slaves in all of the thirteen colonies excepting
                    Massachusetts, at the adoption of the Constitution, and Puritan Massachusetts
                    profited largely by the slave-traffic.</p>
<p>Washington, Jefferson, Madison, and Henry did not approve of slavery; but they
                    accepted the compromises of the Constitution, believing that it would gradually
                    perish without convulsion to property-interests. Jefferson's great lesson to the
                    republic on the subject was given in the Ordinance of 1787, that excluded slaves
                    from the whole Northwestern Territory; but there were not only great
                    property-interests, but strong convictions, in some of the Southern States, to
                    sustain slavery: and it is not surprising that the framework of a new
                    government, aiming to harmonize widely-conflicting views, trusted to the future
                    the adjustment of antagonisms which it was hoped would perish, in the fullness
                    of time, without disturbing the peace of the nation.</p>
<p>We can now see wherein Washington and Jefferson erred; but who of their day, or
                    of ours, could have been as wise as they, in surmounting the countless obstacles
                    to the creation of a constitutional republic?</p>
<p>You are often told that slavery was the issue that plunged the North and the
                    South into fraternal conflict. Slavery was not the source of the war. Its
                    interests happened to be most intimately interwoven with the fundamental dispute
                    that estranged the two sections; but the slavery-issue never could have assumed
                    disturbing proportions, had the founders of the republic clearly 
                    decided the supreme question of the scope of our nationality. It was the broader
                    and deeper issue of the constitutional power of State and Nation that defied
                    peaceable adjustment. For three-quarters of a century, the question had been
                    asked: Are we a Nation or a Confederation at will? and it had been answered with
                    equal ability, integrity, and patriotism, and in nearly equal numbers, affirming
                    each.</p>
<p>The growth and power of slavery, that were not anticipated by those who framed
                    our structure of government, were the creation of the steady and positive
                    enlargement of the theory of State sovereignty and the long-passive assent of
                    those who disputed and feared it. Jefferson boldly taught the sovereignty of the
                    State; Calhoun enlarged upon Jefferson; and the leaders of 1861 enlarged upon
                    Calhoun, until the refusal to recognize the individual rights of States, as
                    paramount to the National authority in every State of the Union, precipitated
                    civil war. Slavery had much to do with broadening and intensifying the issue,
                    but there was not a disputed demand of slavery that was not anchored in the
                    unsettled sovereignty of the State.</p>
<p>Jefferson, the great leader for popular government, for the dethronement of
                    centralization, and for the sovereignty of the State, had consecrated the great
                    Northwest to freedom; and he was logical in all his theories, when we consider
                    the great battle he had to fight. He dreaded centralization, and wisely dreaded
                    it. He saw the dregs of monarchy in the demand for a strong government, and he
                    had no weapon with which to oppose  it successfully but the
                    sovereignty of the State. He did not battle for slavery, for he was not its
                    friend: he did not battle for slavery-extension, for he did not dream of that.
                    He rescued popular government from what he regarded as its most dangerous foes,
                    and the States now glittering as jewels in the crown of the republic, created in
                    the then unknown land ceded to the Union under Jefferson's matchless
                    statesmanship, tell how exceptionally grand were his achievements.</p>
<p>And what more beautiful or attractive theory could be presented to a free people,
                    than the sovereignty of the State? It was the bulwark of safety against the
                    despotism of centralized power, and it quickened every instinct and impulse of a
                    free people. Who could forecast the fearful peril with which it was fraught? It
                    required no special perspicacity to appreciate the danger of disruption, if
                    Hamilton had triumphed over Jefferson and made centralization a positive feature
                    of the new republic; but the sovereignty of the State appealed to freedom: it
                    appealed to the pride of community: it appealed to the self-appreciation of
                    individual manhood: and it appealed to the love and sanctity of home; but it
                    rejected every attribute of nationality.</p>
<p>Centralized governmental authority had visible peril: it invited despotic
                    elements to effort; it appealed to the human infirmity that grasps power; and
                    its logical tendency is to the stealthy abridgement of popular rights. But the
                    sovereignty of the State, in a government of free people, was beautiful and
                    fragrant as the rose with its hidden thorns. Of the two great highways  open to the feeble and hesitating government, both gave promise of
                    future safety, both were beset with danger; and concession and compromise handed
                    down to succeeding generations the grave problems the fathers could not solve.
                    You naturally ask: "Was there no middle-ground on which the new nation could
                    have been founded?" No: there was no middle-ground then; there is none now;
                    there can be none in the future.</p>
<p>The prerogatives of nationality must be clear and unmistakable, or the nation
                    must be the plaything of every popular caprice or passion. There is but one
                    source of safety in our nationality founded in the liberty of law: that is, the
                    reserved sovereignty of the people over the power of their government. They make
                    and unmake constitutions and government, and in their unquestioned
                    sovereignty-asserted, as it ever can be, in all the channels of authority-is the
                    sole safety of the republic, against the despotic abuse of national
                    prerogatives.</p>
<p>In the very cornerstone of the new republic, shattered by antagonistic
                    construction from the day the government was organized, and in the growing and
                    adverse interests which attached to disputed policies, we have the true source
                    of our civil conflict. For nearly the period of a generation, the opposing
                    theories of the power of State and Nation were discussed as abstract
                    propositions, rather than as vital principles applicable to practical
                    statesmanship. Slavery was sheltered under the sovereignty of the State, and
                    there were none of consequence to assail its constitutional right; but, in 1820,
                    the  admission of Missouri precipitated a direct issue between
                    disputing constructionists. Vast property-interests were enlisted with the
                    South; and, in the South-as in the North, and as in all peoples-interest colors
                    and intensifies conviction. Jefferson, Madison, and Marshall were yet living;
                    but the South had passed from the policy of gradual emancipation, that was
                    expected by the founders of the government, to the policy of slavery-extension.
                    It had then become a great property-power and a great political power: and, with
                    the sovereignty of the State taught by the ablest and best statesmen of the
                    South, and by many of the ablest and best of the North-with both the sovereignty
                    of the State and the divine authority for slavery taught in every home, in every
                    school, in every pulpit, of the Southern States, and with sincerest political
                    and religious conviction and individual and general property-interest to
                    crystallize Southern sentiment, you can understand how the Missouri contest
                    brought the loosely-anchored nation to the very verge of destruction.</p>
<p>And how was it saved? Then, as in the framing of the Constitution, the vital
                    point of dispute was evaded: concession and compromise again transmitted to
                    posterity the problem that the statesmen of 1820 could not solve. It created a
                    pacificator in Henry Clay; but it left our government with doubtful and disputed
                    prerogatives, to vex the coming generation. Missouri was admitted, with slavery:
                    all the territory north of it was solemnly dedicated to freedom: and the
                    disputants retired from the drawn battle, to fortify their camps for future  struggle. That conflict made slavery-aggression the logical
                    offspring of the sovereignty of the State. The lines were clearly defined: the
                    obviously opposing interests of the free industry of the North and the menial
                    industry of the South were arrayed in hostility that, however smothered for a
                    third of a century, was implacable.</p>
<p>The threat of nullification in South Carolina, in l831, was another and a bolder
                    assertion of the sovereignty of the State; and it, like the Missouri dispute,
                    was settled by a compromise tariff, without touching the vital point in
                    controversy. Again did our statesmen transmit to posterity the problem they
                    could not solve.</p>
<p>In 1850, the disputing hosts were marshaled to convulse the nation over the
                    admission of California and the organization of the other Mexican Territories.
                    After tempestuous strife, compromise measures were enacted admitting California
                    with a free Constitution, organizing the Territories without interdicting
                    slavery, and revising the law for the rendition of slaves. Political revolution
                    followed, in North and South. Toombs and McDonald locked horns on the compromise
                    in a battle for the gubernatorial chair of Georgia; and Jefferson Davis and
                    Henry S. Foote resigned their seats in the Senate, to contest the Governorship
                    of Mississippi on the same issue; while the banner of Free Soil was unfurled
                    with formidable numbers in its following in the North. Georgia and Mississippi
                    elected Toombs and Foote; but Massachusetts and Ohio, in the confusion of
                    parties, called Charles Sumner and Salmon P. Chase, then un-known in
                    the circles of partisan politics, to a new destiny as great national leaders,
                    and Henry Wilson was sent to fill the seat of Daniel Webster in the Senate.
                    Then, as in 1820, and again in 1831, our statesmen transmitted to their
                    successors the problem they could not solve.</p>
<p>Growth of population, growth of industry-free and slave-growth of commercial
                    interest in the opposing theories of constitutional power, the friction of
                    perpetual watching, and the wounds of repeated conflicts intensified alike
                    conviction and effort on both sides; and the repeal of the Missouri compromise
                    in the Kansas-Nebraska bill of 1854 was logical, because that restriction was a
                    frowning menace to the whole theory of the sovereignty of the State, as then
                    taught in its advanced features.</p>
<p>The sovereignty of the State made slaves property; the Territories were the
                    common property of all; and equal rights for Northern and Southern property of
                    every kind were demanded and obtained. Then came the logical demand, from the
                    new standpoint of the sovereignty of the State, for the right of transit in free
                    States; and finally came the Dredd Scott decision, that crowned the South with
                    victory. It had sectionalized freedom and nationalized slavery. It was then that
                    Abraham Lincoln, in the most carefully considered and prepared political address
                    of his life, delivered before the Springfield convention that nominated him for
                    United States Senator, against Douglas, in 1858, voiced the considerate
                    sentiment of all sections, when he said: "I believe this government cannot
                    endure permanently, half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to  be dissolved: I do not expect the house to fall; but I do expect
                    that it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the
                    other. Either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it, and
                    place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course
                    of ultimate extinction, or its advocates will push it forward till it shall
                    become alike lawful in all the States, old as well as new, North as well as
                    South." This was before Mr. Seward's bitterly-criticised proclamation of the irrepressible conflict, and it was the
                    sober truth.</p>
<p>The general political disruption that followed created a new party, with a single
                    creed; and a change of half the number of votes in a single ward of Philadelphia
                    would have given the new party the victory in its first battle, and made Fremont
                    President instead of Buchanan. In l860, Mr. Lincoln was chosen President: it was
                    the first lawfully-expressed mandate of the sovereign power of the Nation, that
                    the sovereignty of the State was not supreme; and then, for the first time since
                    Washington, and Hamilton, and Jefferson, and Madison met the issue and passed it
                    by, three-quarters of a century before, the grave problem had to be solved.</p>
<p>In vain did sincere men plead for compromise: the sturdy conviction and
                    intensified purpose of the most intelligent and earnest people of the world made
                    it impossible. We point to unwise acts on both sides, and thoughtlessly charge
                    them with precipitating war; but, over and above all the follies of sectional
                    disturbance, were the wisest and bravest men of both sections, who 
                    saw and accepted the inevitable, while ceaselessly but hopelessly striving to
                    avert it. The sovereignty of the State then summoned its last prerogative: to
                    sever the Union, and end the pretense of nationality. Peaceable dismemberment or
                    civil war: such was the only choice presented, and civil war was inevitable. Do
                    you inquire why it was inevitable? Let me answer in a single sentence: I am sure
                    that peaceable disunion would have brought anarchy to the North; I believe that,
                    sooner or later, and soon at the latest, it would have brought anarchy to the
                    whole continent.</p>
<p>There are two memorable political deliverances to which the student of to-day can turn, in beginning the study of the causes
                    which led to what must ever seem a most unnatural conflict. Jefferson boldly
                    gave the keynote for the construction of the Constitution in favor of the
                    sovereignty of the State, in the Kentucky resolutions of 1798. He framed them,
                    and Madison framed like resolutions passed by the Virginia Legislature the same
                    year. In the first of Jefferson's resolutions, he declares that the States "are
                    not united on the principle of unlimited submission to their general
                    government," that "they constituted a general government for special purposes,
                    delegated to that government certain definite powers, reserving, each State to
                    itself, the residuary mass of right to their own self-government, . . . that
                    this government, created by this compact, was not made the exclusive or final
                    judge of the powers delegated to itself, . . . but that, as in all other cases
                    of  compact among parties having no common judge, each party has an
                    equal right to judge for itself, as well of infractions as of the mode and
                    measure of redress.'' One year later, the Kentucky Legislature simply amplified
                    Jefferson's resolutions of 1798, by another resolution declaring "that the
                    several States which formed the instrument, being sovereign and independent,
                    have the unquestionable right to judge of the infraction; that a nullification,
                    by those sovereignties, of all unauthorized acts done under color of that
                    instrument, is the rightful remedy."</p>
<p>Such was the theory of our nationality proclaimed by Jefferson, whose policy
                    ruled the republic for sixty years. The States were not only declared sovereign,
                    but independent, and they were to be the sole judges of any wrong, and of the
                    remedy, in a conflict between State and Nation. All that followed, touching the
                    dispute, was entirely logical under Jefferson's construction of our feeble
                    fundamental law. From the Missouri conflict of 1820 to the South Carolina
                    eruption of 1831, thence to the California struggle of 1850, thence to the
                    Kansas-Nebraska controversy of 1854-60, thence to the Dredd Scott decision, and
                    thence to supreme national mastery or war, it was steady and consistent
                    progress.</p>
<p>The other memorable deliverance came from the Chicago Lincoln convention of 1860,
                    when a body of able and intensely earnest men came to reverse and direct our
                    national destiny, as Jefferson came to reverse and direct it in 1800. It
                    declared "that the new dogma that the Constitution, of its own force, carries
                    slavery  into any or all of the Territories of the United States is
                    a dangerous political heresy, at variance with the explicit provisions of that
                    instrument itself, with contemporaneous exposition, and with legislative and
                    judicial precedent: is revolutionary in its tendency, and subversive of the
                    peace and harmony of the country."</p>
<p>These two deliverances, coming from equally honest and earnest conviction, are
                    the landmarks of the sixty years of political history which made the issue of
                    the powers of State and Nation so momentous and fraught with such vast property
                    and political interests, that there was no middle-ground, no basis of
                    compromise, no solution but peaceable dismemberment or fraternal war. Had it
                    been possible to evade the issue then, as it was evaded in the formation of the
                    Constitution, or in the Missouri, the South Carolina, the California, and the
                    Kansas-Nebraska controversies, disruption could and would have been delayed, but
                    not averted; but the issue had finally confronted the country in an attitude
                    that demanded prompt and final solution, and the question whether State or
                    Nation was sovereign mocked every arbitrament but the sword.</p>
<p>Thus came our civil war. It is erroneously accepted by the multitude as a war
                    caused by slavery, and waged solely for the maintenance or destruction of
                    slavery. Slavery became so important a factor in precipitating the appeal to
                    arms, and the effect of the conflict upon slavery was so distinctly visible to
                    all, that even pretended historians have assumed that slavery was the one great
                    issue that summoned a million reapers to the har-vest of death. The
                    young men before me, who must be among the teachers of the future, should better
                    understand the struggle that established a new epoch in the history of the
                    republic. Let us briefly look at the fountain, and trace its streams as they
                    coursed through the Lincoln administration. The fourth resolution of the
                    declaration of principles on which Lincoln was elected declared: "That the
                    maintenance inviolate of the rights of the States, and especially the right of
                    each State to order and control its own domestic institutions according to its
                    own judgment exclusively, is essential to that balance of powers on which the
                    perfection and endurance of our political fabric depends." There were men in
                    that convention who did not honestly believe in that hiatic declaration, but
                    they were inconsiderable in number and power; and no man in Virginia more
                    sincerely believed in it, in the broadest interpretation, than did Abraham
                    Lincoln. He had never, by word or deed, questioned the right of States to
                    establish, maintain, or abolish slavery; and, in his first inaugural address, he
                    pointedly declared, by quoting from a previous public address: "I have no
                    purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with slavery in the States where
                    it exists. I believe that I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no
                    inclination to do so."</p>
<p>There were leading men in the North who either welcomed civil war or accepted it
                    with complacency, because they expected from it the bloody overthrow of slavery;
                    but I speak what Lincoln's public and private utterances, and what his public
                    and private acts, uni-formly declared, when I say that there was not
                    a day, from the date of his inauguration till the first of January, 1863, when
                    the final proclamation of emancipation was issued, that the war could not have
                    been ended by the restoration of the National Union and its authority, without
                    destroying slavery in a single State. The very circumstances under which the
                    secession of Southern Senators and Representatives occurred proved that it was
                    not slavery they were defending by revolutionary action. The President, the
                    Senate, and the Supreme Court were each a bulwark of safety to the South against
                    any infraction of the sovereignty of the State in the regulation of its own
                    domestic institutions, and the political power of the Senate was given to the
                    Lincoln administration only by the resignation of Southern Senators. Slavery in
                    the States was safe beyond question; but the higher issue of the absolute
                    sovereignty and independence of the State, as then interpreted, was assailed
                    with resolute, aggressive purpose, and it had no hope but in revolution.</p>
<p>When war came, and great battles had been fought, the pressure on Lincoln for an
                    avowed emancipation policy daily grew in strength and intensity, and Lincoln
                    severed strong personal and political ties by patient and exhaustive effort to
                    end the war by the restoration of the Union without forcing the final decision
                    of the slavery issue. He knew that slavery was not the cause of the war; he knew
                    that, with slavery gradually and peaceably abolished and the sovereignty of the
                    State still paramount to the sovereignty of the Nation, new South Carolina
                    nullification of revenue-laws, or new Connecticut conven-tions to
                    interpose in favor of foreign enemies, or new Pennsylvania whiskey-rebellions
                    would peril our national existence. He concisely stated his position, in his
                    letter to Horace Greeley, on the 22d of August, 1862, when he said: "If there be
                    those who would not save the Union unless at the same time they could destroy
                    slavery, I do not agree with them. My paramount object is to save the Union, and
                    not either to save or to destroy slavery."</p>
<p>At last, it became a supreme necessity to obey public sentiment in the North, and
                    to disarm the threatening sentiment of foreign nations which hated free
                    government North or South, by an avowed emancipation-policy; but, when it was
                    avowed, it was done with every opportunity for the absolute safety of slavery in
                    the States. The preliminary proclamation of emancipation was issued on the 22d
                    of September, 1862, and it fixed the following 1st of January, more than three
                    months in the future, for the final proclamation, with the assurance that it
                    should not apply to any "not then in rebellion"; and it proffered compensation
                    for slaves to all who, at the expiration of the more than three months of time
                    given, were found under the authority of the Union, and accepted immediate or
                    gradual emancipation. And, when the final proclamation was issued-on the lst of
                    January, 1863-it excepted parts of Virginia and Louisiana, and all of the States
                    of Missouri, Kentucky, and Tennessee, from its mandate.</p>
<p>That step once taken by the Government, after nearly two years of war for the
                    maintenance of the Union, could be receded from only when the sword com-manded it; but there was not a day, from the date of the final
                    proclamation of emancipation until the 3d of February, 1565, when Stephens,
                    Hunter, and Campbell, the Confederate commissioners, met Lincoln at Fortress
                    Monroe, that Lincoln would not have gladly accepted peace under a restored
                    Union, with compensated emancipation. I well remember hearing him discuss it,
                    late in the autumn of 1864, when the question of military success on great
                    battlefields was no longer problematical; and, could the people of the South
                    have heard him as I did, and trusted him as all trusted who knew him, I believe
                    that there would have been early peace with compensated emancipation, and
                    reconstruction without the desolating tread of the thief and adventurer. I saw
                    his plan, written out by his own hand, based on the payment of four hundred
                    millions to the owners of slaves. I shall never forget the sorrow with which he
                    contemplated the probability of future battles and sacrifice of life, and the
                    earnestness with which he sought peace when mere ambition would have pressed for
                    the laurels of the conqueror. He said: "Four hundred millions! It seems a large
                    sum to add to our already heavy debt; but one hundred days of war will cost as
                    much. If we are to be reunited, the loss North and South is equally the loss of
                    the Nation; and, when the sacrifice of life and the added sorrow to the homes of
                    both sections are considered, there is no argument against compensated
                    emancipation. It would not only give us peace, but it would temper the sad
                    sectional estrangement, and enable the South to resume her 
                    industries and contribute her share to the payment of our national debt." I give
                    the exact substance of his remarks, and nearly his exact words.</p>
<p>When he met the Confederate commissioners, on the 3d of February, 1865, he was
                    precluded from proposals for peace by the limitation upon their action from the
                    Confederate President, making the recognition of the Confederacy a condition
                    precedent to negotiation. Compensated emancipation was possible even then, for
                    it had one unfaltering potential friend in Abraham Lincoln. How wise he was when
                    he suggested it, in the fall of 1864, is proved by the expenditure of nearly
                    twice four hundred millions in war, with its countless cost of life and sorrow
                    added, before peace was finally attained.</p>
<p>Thus did Lincoln, the oracle of the North during the war, seek to protect slavery
                    in the States until an emancipation-policy became a military, political, and
                    diplomatic necessity; and, from the date of the emancipation-policy until the 3d
                    of February, 1865, he was the open, earnest supporter of compensated
                    emancipation. He waged war not against slavery, but for the supreme sovereignty
                    of the republic.</p>
<p>I have thus presented the supreme issue that led to our civil war; but you will
                    still ask why peaceable adjustment was not possible with a people so grand in
                    statesmanship, and bound together by the most patriotic ties. In answer, let me
                    ask you to glance at the distinctive character of our people, from the Congress
                    of 1776 to the Congress of 1886, and from the battlefield of Bunker Hill to that
                    of Yorktown, and from Bull Run  to Appomattox, and you will see that
                    every effort and achievement was of heroic type. The fathers who fled from their
                    vexed homes beyond the sea, for freedom of conviction, gave equally sturdy
                    conviction to their children, and Puritan and Cavalier were alike resolute in
                    their purpose. The same people were in North and South: inheritors of the same
                    heroic manhood: sharers of the same traditions, of the same freedom, of the same
                    religion: worshipers of the same God, at the same altars: warriors under the
                    same flag, from Valley Forge and Lundy's Lane to New Orleans and the halls of
                    the Montezumas: and yet how strangely and sadly they misunderstood each other!
                    Neither credited the other with the profound sincerity that pervaded the great
                    body of the people of both sections; and, stranger still, with the most heroic
                    record of any nationality, neither believed the other heroic to the extent of
                    sacrifice, in the sectional issue that divided them. Both were forgetful that,
                    for nearly two generations, the education, the worship, the prayers, of the two
                    sections, had been in direct antagonism on the issues of national sovereignty
                    and slavery. They were forgetful of the heroic religious conviction that had
                    dismembered great churches on the issues which finally precipitated war. The
                    North believed the South to be bombastic without courage, and the South believed
                    the North to be shriveled into money-getting and cowardice. I remember, as if it
                    were but yesterday, a Legislative caucus of the dominant party in my own State,
                    held when Sumter was fired upon, in which I declared that, if war came, the
                    South would be heroic  as the North in battle; and the response was
                    a flood of hisses from a majority of my associates. How sadly that prophecy was
                    fulfilled, the countless graves of our battlefields fearfully attest. Each
                    entered the war, believing, that the other would speedily weary of it, and end
                    the strife; but both learned too late what the unbroken history of a century
                    should have taught.</p>
<p>A Confederate government, established with all the attributes of an independent
                    nationality but the recognition of the government from which it seceded, and
                    promptly acknowledged as a belligerent power by England and France-where was the
                    middle-ground for compromise? The battle thus begun could end, short of the
                    mastery of the sword, only by the absolute surrender of the parent government or
                    of the Confederacy; and where, in all the history of American effort, was there
                    a precedent for such a solution of the dispute? No: there was, then, no peace
                    possible but by war; and on the hills of Gettysburg the decisive struggle came.
                    For three days the issue of battle trembled in the balance, and, when decided
                    against the repulsed but undaunted legions of Lee, the contest of Caesar and
                    Pompey on the plains of Pharsalia was not more decisive of the destiny of Rome
                    than was Gettysburg of the destiny of the Confederacy.</p>
<p>A less sincere and heroic people than Americans would have there ended the
                    conflict; but the Southerners, like the Spartan warriors of old, still fought
                    and fell: repeating, in the name of the South, the inscription on the graves of
                    the heroes of Leonidas: "Oh, stranger,  go tell the Lacedemonians
                    that we lie here in obedience to their laws." Even with Gettysburg lost, and
                    Vicksburg on the same natal day of the republic, sending the Father of Waters
                    again "unvexed to the sea," other great and bloody battles were fought; but
                    Gettysburg and Vicksburg unalterably determined the destiny that made Appomattox
                    historic.</p>
<p>Thus came, thus ended, civil war; and the matchless grandeur of American
                    citizenship was as sublime in peace as in the flame of battle. Who saw the
                    emblems of victor or vanquished, at Appomattox? A swordless chieftain met the
                    chieftain whose warriors had fought against overwhelming numbers until it was no
                    longer heroic to die in fragmentary and hopeless struggle. They met for peace.
                    The defeated insurgent was welcomed to the bountiful supplies of the flag that
                    was his enemy an hour before, speeded to his home, and he bore with him the
                    hearty fellowship of his late deadly foes and the guaranteed protection of the
                    Nation. By the order of President Lincoln, issued through General Weitzel, in
                    Richmond when Lincoln was present, the State authorities of Virginia were given
                    safe conduct to resume their functions at Richmond, and restore the commonwealth
                    to the Union; and, in obedience to the some instructions from President Lincoln,
                    personally given to General Sherman at City Point, in presence of General Grant,
                    the first Sherman-Johnston military treaty, furling every Confederate flag,
                    retiring every Confederate soldier from the field throughout the entire  South, and restoring civil authority in every State, was framed and
                    executed.</p>
<p>But, dark as had been the days of war, a darker day dawned upon the South, just
                    as Sherman and Johnston met to give the country universal peace. Abraham Lincoln
                    was murdered, and, in the bewildering frenzy, the Sherman-Johnston peace was
                    swept away, and passion and resentment were given the mastery. But peace came to
                    the warriors of the blue and the gray; while disturbers who are sometimes
                    invincible in peace, and usually invisible in war, for a full decade desolated
                    the South and denied tranquillity to all. The soldiers of both sections, who had
                    made American heroism the most lustrous of history, obeyed the command for
                    peace; and, from warrior to citizen-from the hoarse music of shotted guns to all
                    the various channels of commerce, industry, and trade-a million and a half of
                    heroes settled down to dignify a common citizenship. In no land but ours, would
                    such peace have been possible; and ours is the only country in the world where
                    the soldiers of civil war have been the bulwark of safety for law and order in
                    every community. When Johnston and Buckner stood with Sherman and Sheridan at
                    the grave of Grant, as pall-bearers, they reflected the grander heroism of peace
                    that only the soldiery of America could portray.</p>
<p>It would be sad, indeed, if the lesson of our civil war ended with the story of
                    sacrifice, sorrow, and desolation, even with the silver lining of the heroism of
                    our people in battle and in peace; but the lesson does not thus end. The present
                    is full of promise: the future of our  great people is the brightest
                    of all the peoples of the earth; and, but for the hitherto matchless progress of
                    my own generation, I would wish to lag even superfluous on the stage of action,
                    to witness and be an unnoted part of the grander advancement that must weave the
                    chaplets for the great actors of your generation. How we have progressed, you
                    may understand when I tell you that I was an interested student of our country's
                    growth when its population was only one fourth of our present sixty millions;
                    that I can recall the birth of eleven of our thirtyeight States; that I well remember when there was not a
                    steamship on the seas: when there was not a railway-locomotive operated in the
                    world: when the lightning messenger was undreamed of: when to have predicted the
                    ocean-cable would have been regarded as the phantom of a hopeless lunatic: when
                    the Golden Gate of the Pacific was an idle waste, under semi-barbaric rule: when
                    the great Northwest, with its now-brilliant stars in the galaxy of States, was
                    known only as the home of the savage: when the coming Empire State in the
                    Southwest was tossed in revolution by adventurers: and when schools and
                    newspapers were luxuries enjoyed only by the affluent. Look around you, and tell
                    me what must be the achievement of your age, with your vastly greater sources of
                    enlightened progress! With such lessons yet fresh in the memories of the
                    fast-fading actors, what must be the story of the young student now before me,
                    who shall come back to this fountain of learning to portray the advancement of
                    the next generation?</p>
<p>Will he deplore our civil war? I think not. He will deplore its bereavements, as
                    the angel of every better nature sorrows for the sorrowing; but will he not
                    point to the war as dating the new era of matchless advancement in all the
                    greater attributes of national power and grandeur? Of what will he speak? Those
                    of us who have felt the wounds of the conflict will then rest in the dreamless
                    home of the dead, and the living will be inspired by the new duties and the new
                    opportunities before them. The scars left by the harsh invader in Lexington, and
                    the charred walls and broken columns of once lovely homes left by the harsh
                    invader in Chambersburg, will be as twice-told tales to the earnest men who must
                    then see about them a nation greater in population than the entire Russian
                    Empire of to-day: greater than England and France
                    combined: greater than any civilized nation of the earth. He will speak of the
                    new past as we speak of the conflicts of 1776 and 1812, with England, and of
                    1847, with Mexico; and he will point to the monuments of the living present as
                    the lesson of the occasion. He will tell of the new departure that made a
                    homogeneous people, in industry, in trade, in education, in thrift, and in
                    progress, from Northern lakes to Southern gulf, and from the Eastern to the
                    Western sea; and he will point, with all the pride of home and section, to the
                    tide of immigration and wealth from the North and from Europe, diverted from the
                    highways toward the setting sun to the more inviting fields, forests, and mines
                    of the South. He will be armed to challenge the North in the race for productive
                    riches;  he will portray the wealth of character and fortune that
                    has been created by the desolation of war; and he will date the most beneficent
                    growth of the American people from the conflict whose wounds are yet sensitive,
                    even when viewing their own great work. When war began, a locomotive could not
                    be artistically tired south of Mason and Dixon's line: to-day, nearly fifteen thousand miles of Southern railway could be
                    changed in gauge almost between two settings of the sun, and ten thousand miles
                    of it were constructed since the war.</p>
<p>The land for the homes of our future growth is not in the West, nor in the East,
                    nor in the North: it is in the South, where there are more unimproved and
                    improvable acres than the present total improved land in all the States of the
                    Union, excepting Illinois. There is now no barrier to industry in any section of
                    the Union, and the two hundred and fifty million acres of land open to the
                    husbandman, embracing the valuable forests of the nation, with fruitful soil,
                    mines of boundless wealth, genial climate, and abundant water-power, will surely
                    enrich the story of national progress to be told here to the next generation.
                    Then, as now, there will be monuments of the past as fingerboards on the highway
                    of industrial and national greatness. As we turn back to Washington and
                    Jefferson, and to Jackson and Clay, as exemplars of American character and
                    achievement, so will the people who come after us turn to the two foremost
                    exemplars of opposing greatness in our civil war. One name will leap up from the
                    love of every Northern heart-one name will be lisped in  tenderest
                    affection by every son and daughter of the South; they are indissolubly linked
                    with the greatness that is above envy and hate. They met in mighty conflict for
                    the mightiest issues, and yet gave the world no utterance or token of
                    resentment; they taught to friend and foe, above the fiercest passion of civil
                    strife, the lesson of duty and of sacrifice for duty. The dust of one rests in
                    these college-halls, in the tomb of Robert E. Lee; the dust of the other rests
                    in his own loved and loving Prairie State, in the tomb of Abraham Lincoln. They
                    taught, by word and deed, in the greatest actions of our greatest conflict:
                    "With malice toward none, with charity for all." That ends the office of eulogy.</p>
<p>But the lesson of our civil war is not fully presented by the consideration, of
                    its primary causes, its heroic history, and the sublime progress it has achieved
                    for free institutions and the best civilization of the world. The attributes of
                    our nationality are now so clearly defined that none dispute them, and
                    inconsiderate men point to assured perpetuity because of the inherent strength
                    of our government. You, who will fight the battles for our free institutions
                    during the next generation, must not be deceived by the presumed safety of
                    popular government. The pendulum that is swung in violence will be violent in
                    its return, and sweep beyond its justly-defined limits. For a generation before
                    the war, the equilibrium was disturbed by the violent swing to the supreme
                    sovereignty of the State, and the return to a supreme nationality 
                    was given additional impetus by the violent throes of revolution.</p>
<p>All nations are led to grandeur or to decay by the resistless mutations which
                    come from both war and peace, and ours cannot be an exception to the rule. The
                    lesson of our civil war is incomplete without noting and guarding against the
                    chief peril that comes with newly-defined national sovereignty. It is the safe
                    team that runs away because the reins are loosened, and safety is assumed
                    without vigilance; and the decline and fall of many great nationalities were
                    solely by unseen and unappreciated dangers which insensibly sapped the vitals of
                    just administration.</p>
<p>There was danger in the sovereignty of the State that dismantled the sovereignty
                    of the Nation, and there is danger in the sovereignty of the Nation that has
                    dismantled the sovereignty of the State. There is weakness in the very strength
                    of our nationality, and it is clearly taught by the logical results of the war.
                    The peril to free government to-day is centralization;
                    and its deformed image has been often visible, since the war, as the legitimate
                    offspring of debauched political authority. It has called to earnest protest and
                    fearless battle many of the ablest and best men of the North who were in sincere
                    accord with the establishment of national supremacy. It disrupted the great
                    party of power in 1872; and it was the undaunted friends of Lincoln who halted
                    at the threshold of despotic political power; and revolutionized the national
                    administration. They saw centralization in government, in finance, in business,
                    in  every channel where its power could reach with profit; and the
                    industry of the North is convulsive to-day chiefly in
                    protest against the common peril to industrial thrift and national safety that
                    has been born of centralization.</p>
<p>Remember that, in both North and South, during the war, there was one supreme
                    law-"salus populi suprema lex"; and those who administered government were of
                    necessity the judges of the "safety of the people." There were forms of popular
                    government alike in the parent nationality and in the Confederacy; but both
                    military and political necessity were often above the law: and what party can
                    thus rule, and not learn to grasp and maintain despotic power? It would be more
                    than human if a season of such authority, fraught with all the disturbing
                    elements of civil conflict and resulting in the triumph of enlarged national
                    prerogatives, did not leave, widespread and deeply planted, the love of the law
                    of command. Ours is a government of law, and its safety is in the liberal and
                    faithful administration of its laws for the benefit of its people; and, while
                    its supreme national attributes are established, the sovereignty of the State is
                    as sacred to-day, and as essential to the enjoyment of
                    free government, as it was when Jefferson triumphed as its standard-bearer in
                    1800. The State is not sovereign against the unity of the republic; but it is
                    sovereign in all else to assure the happiness and prosperity of its citizens,
                    except wherein all are alike restrained by the fundamental law.</p>
<p>And there is one supreme sovereignty over all-over State and Nation: the absolute
                    sovereignty of the American people. They reversed Federal centralization in
                    1800, under Jefferson, because it was construed to justify despotic oppression
                    under color of law; and, with reversed political power, was reversed the
                    judgment of the highest Court. They reversed the sovereignty of the State in
                    1860, when it boldly asserted itself above national unity; and, with it, again
                    reversed the solemn judgment of the first judicial tribunal of the republic.</p>
<p>With them and for them you will be called to battle against the dregs of the
                    despotism of war, that will ever be plausibly excused or justified, as
                    centralization comes with gifts to open the citadel of freedom. Against it, let
                    your hatred be implacable: let your effort be tireless: let your patriotism be
                    unabated. It is the great peril to free government. It will not come with
                    banners, declaring its purpose; but it will come with deceitful promise: it will
                    affect to reject the crown, as Caesar did; but remember that Rome was never
                    free, after the Rubicon had been crossed. Trust the people; educate the people;
                    teach them that eternal vigilance is ever the price of liberty; warn them
                    against every approach to despotic authority in a government whose supreme
                    sovereignty is only in the people, and whose Nation, State, County, and Home are
                    "distinct as the billows, yet one as the sea."</p>
<p>Young men of Washington and Lee, I have performed my task, and have striven to
                    speak with greater candor than is common on occasions such as  this.
                    I have remembered that you will be leaders and teachers, in the vigor of your
                    lives, when the sovereign power of this fair land will rest in one hundred
                    millions of people; and surely such great duties and such grand opportunities
                    demand the counsels of truth and soberness. If I have led you to new thoughts
                    and new appreciation of duty and country, however you may criticise my premises or conclusions, I shall feel that something
                    has been done, in an humble way, to preserve and advance the grandest government
                    and the noblest people of the earth.</p>
