                            Status," by G. C. H. Hasskarl, 1898</h3>
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> Hasskarl, a Lutheran minister in Chambersburg, PA, argues that African Americans
                    are inferior to whites, using scientific, historical, and religious arguments to
                    bolster his claims.</p>

<p>That Bishop Turner of Georgia, and not a few of the leaders of the colored people
                    of the South of to-day should revive the old colonization scheme through the
                    medium of the International Migration Society, after the American Colonization
                    Society which was organized many years ago in the belief that it would be able
                    to solve the negro problem in this country by building up a vast empire in
                    Africa, was doomed to disappointment;--this undertaking of Bishop Turner's
                    surely should furnish food for serious reflection to intelligent men actuated by
                    sincere and philanthropic motives. The Bishop is openly advocating such a
                    course, and joins Mr. Henry M. Stanley in the belief that the civilization of
                    Africa will be largely helped through such a scheme. He has visited Liberia
                    several times, and is of the opinion that "it offers many opportunities for his
                    race were it to exercise the qualities of industry and self-reliance." Note, the
                    Bishop favors the transportation of the Negro of [begin page 4] America to
                    Liberia, a country of which Liberian Minister to London is reported to have
                    written thus:</p>
<p>"The conditions in Liberia, according to him, are unusually hard even for men of
                    the physical and mental temperament of the Southern negro, and he looks upon
                    them as more trying than are those in our own country. Besides this, he argues
                    that even if his people should colonize Liberia and other territory and
                    successfully develop its resources, the white man would be sure to follow, reap
                    the reward of the toil of others; obtain the supremacy and create the very
                    conditions that hamper the development of the negro in the South."</p>
<p>Accordingly, it does not look as if this puzzling problem would as yet be solved;
                    in fact, we seriously question whether it ever can be, not only because "the
                    white man would be sure to obtain supremacy, etc.; but also because the negro
                    naturally is wanting in "the qualities of industry and self-reliance"; and
                    therefore our interrogatory.</p>
<p>What of the negro whose presence has ever been "one of the most difficult
                    problems of ethnology?" "His physiognomy is so strongly distinctive, that is
                    anywhere on earth a radical difference in the stocks of mankind can be
                    established, it should be here." "The woolly hair, projecting muzzle, flattened
                    nose, round eyes and prominent cheek bones, these mark him off from all other
                    [begin page 5] races." Equally as distinctive is "the religion of the negro
                    which consists in a dread of evil beings, whom he seeks to propitiate by
                    sacrifices and charms, and under whose influence he supposes himself continually
                    to dwell. He is somewhat slow and dull in mind," and in consequence has the
                    sense faculties of observation developed to an extraordinary degree, is given to
                    mimicry; "but quick in emotion" because of his many superstitions, "naturally
                    imaginative, susceptible and religious." Truly, "the negro is an original
                    variety"!-and we here in all seriousness appeal to learned ethnologists and
                    Biblical scholars, to acknowledged men of letters, earnestly applying themselves
                    to make a special study of this "the negro problem," and then to kindly furnish
                    the missionary would in particular with their investigations; and also, at the
                    same time to state, whether in their candid opinion whatever progress the negro
                    has made in the past, is to be attributed to the effects of civilization which
                    is the sequence of human efforts and the ideal of education, or to the work of
                    Christianity-which is active faith in the service of and with God and baptized
                    humanity, or of Christianity and civilization contemporary. For, according to
                    our understanding of the Scriptures which are the only "infallible rule of faith
                    and practice," and ethnologico-historical data, the negro is neither the [begin
                    page 6] progeny of Adam and Eve, nor a descendant of Ham, the youngest son of
                    Noah.</p>
<p>"The divisions into which writers on ethnology separate the human race are mainly
                    three: the Black, the Brown and the Fair.-- --Ethnologists agree for the most
                    part in the grouping of races, but differ only in their pedigree and relation."
                    "In a general way it is often said that Europe represents the posterity of
                    Japheth, Asia of Shem, and Africa of Ham." The Fair race and the Brown have
                    long, straight hair, high foreheads, high noses, thin lips, and white skins;
                    whereas, the negro or Black race are woolly or kinky-headed, have low foreheads,
                    flat noses, thick lips, and a black skin. Since it is with the Black race
                    specially that we purpose here to deal, the above description of the races of
                    mankind will prove explicit enough for an impartial and impassionate discussion
                    of their respective stations which they occupy, and the relations which they
                    sustain to each other, particularly, in God's order of creation, and which is as
                    follows: 1. Birds, 2. Fowls, 3. Cattle, 4. Creeping things, 5. Beasts, 6. Adam
                    and Eve. [begin page 7]</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>In the examination of the subject involved in the caption of this article, let us
                    here notice a few of the prevailing errors which somehow have gained strength
                    and are held by many Christians the world over; namely, that First, Ham's name
                    which in Hebrew means "sunburnt," "swarthy," "black," and Secondly, the curse
                    denounced against him "a servant of servants shall be he unto his brethren"-that
                    is was this curse pronounced upon Ham, that did change him, so that instead of
                    being long, straight haired with a high forehead, high nose, thin lips, and fair
                    as he then was, and like his brothers Japheth and Shem, he was from that day
                    forth, to be kink-headed, low foreheaded, thick lipped and black skinned;--all
                    these remarkable transformations are generally believed to have been effected in
                    Ham, because of his name and in consequence of this curse.</p>
<p>But, is not this one instance and illustration of only too many other erroneous
                    teachings which have been handed down and promulgated as scriptural and true,
                    particularly of biblical doctrines claimed to be according to the Scriptures by
                    the Scriptures, that are in their forced connection and spiritual application
                    simply false, unscriptural and historically untrue. For, the Scrip[begin page
                    8]tures here nowhere state, that such a curse, or any curse whatever, was
                    pronounced against Ham by his father Noah; but that this curse, with whatever it
                    carried with it, was hurled at Canaan, the youngest son of Ham. Gen. IX:25.
                    Again, if no curses ever have changed a white man into a black man, whether
                    pronounced by either God, or by patriarchs, or by prophets or by apostles, then
                    we naturally inquire to know on what principle of interpretation of the
                    Scriptures and of history, the presence of the Negro race is to be accounted
                    for. That he was not one of Noah's family, and yet must have been in the ark,
                    and have entered the same in some capacity or relation to the cattle or other
                    beasts is evident. For, that he did enter the ark when the whole globe deluged
                    and all of mankind excepting Noah and his family and the animals in the ark were
                    destroyed, is evident from the fact that he is now here, and yet not of the
                    family or progeny of Ham. Again "No one has ever suspicioned[sic] either Shorn
                    or Japheth or being the father of the negro; and therefore, he must have come
                    out of the ark, and he could not come out unless he had previously entered it;
                    and if he entered it, that he must have existed before the flood, and that, too,
                    just such a negro as we have now, and consequently not as a descendant of Adam
                    and Eve; and if not the progeny [begin page 9] of Adam and Eve, that he is
                    inevitably a beast, and as such, entered the ark, though having the form of man,
                    and man he is, being so named by Adam. Such is the logic, and such are the
                    conclusions to which their premises lead, if legitimately carried out and by
                    which it is plainly seen that the position assumed by the learned of the present
                    and past ages--that the present race of negroes are the descendants of Ham, and
                    were made so by the name, or by the curse of his father--is false in fact, and
                    but an unwarranted assumption at best." But while this conclusion is inevitable,
                    it also reveals to us another sad fact, that the good white men of our race,
                    though learned and philanthropic, exhibit a weakness, alas! too common in this
                    our day, that anything they wish to believe or think will be popular, that it is
                    very easy to convert the greatest improbabilities into the best grounds of
                    faith. [end page 9]</p>
<p>[begin page 173]</p>
<p>But, what of our Nation and government, the United States? A government
                    acknowledged by all Nations, to be the most cosmoplastic of the Nations of
                    to-day. Who, under God's providence, organized and established it and its
                    "Reformation" principles? Let us appeal to history;--substituting for a
                    "servant," the "slave." "The first attact[sic] on British power, and the [begin
                    page 174] aggressions of its parliament, ever made on this continent was made by
                    a slaveholder, from a slave state, Patrick Henry, May 30, 1765. The first
                    president of the first congress, that ever assembled on this continent, to
                    consider the affairs of the thirteen colonies, and which met in Philadelphia,
                    September 5, 1774, was a slave owner from a slave state, Charles Thompson. The
                    gentleman who was chairman of the committee of the whole on Saturday, the 8th of
                    June 1776, and who, on the morning of the 10th reported the resolutions, that
                    the thirteen colonies, of right ought to be free and independent states, was a
                    slaveholder from a slave state, Benjamin Harrison. The same gentleman again, as
                    chairman of the committee of the whole, reported the Declaration of Independence
                    in form; and to which he affixed his signature, on Thursday, July 4, 1776. The
                    gentleman who wrote the Declaration of Independence was a slave owner, from a
                    slave state, Thomas Jefferson. The gentleman who was selected to lead their
                    armies, as commander in-chief, and who did lead them successfully, to victory
                    and the independence of the country, was a slave owner, from a slave state,
                    George Washington. The gentleman who was president of the con[begin page
                    175]vention to form the constitution of the United States, was a slaveholder,
                    from a slave state, George Washington. The gentleman who wrote the constitution
                    of the United States (making it the best government ever formed on earth), was a
                    slave owner, from a slave state, James Madison. The first president of the
                    United States, under that constitution, and who, under God, give it strength,
                    consistency and power before the world, was a slave owner, from a slave state,
                    George Washington; and these were all white men and slave owners; and whatever
                    of peace, prosperity, happiness and glory, the people of the United States have
                    enjoyed under it, have been from the administration of the government by
                    presidents elected by the people of slave holders, from slave states. When ever
                    the people have elected a president from a non-slaveholding State, commencing
                    with the elder Adams, and down to Mr. Lincoln, confusion, wrangling and strife
                    have been the order of the day until it culminated in the greatest civil war the
                    world has ever beheld, under the last named gentleman."--Why all this has been
                    so is not in the line of our subject. Only this: God will not be mocked. He
                    ordained that the Negro should be the "servant of servants" solely. Thus, [begin
                    page 176] any critic desirous of controverting successfully the central truth of
                    his booklet, let him "drink deep,"--"largely" from the Hebrew and Greek
                    Scriptures first.--To believe less than what is contained in the Scriptures, is
                    infidelity; and to believe more than what is contained in the Scriptures, is
                    superstition.</p>
<p>"Truth, though sometimes slow in its power, is like itself, always consistent;
                    and like its AUTHOR, will always be triumphant. The Bible is true."</p>
