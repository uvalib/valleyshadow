                            Brigadier-General, C.S.A., 1887</h3>
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> This article, found in Volume I of Battles and Leaders of the Civil War, provides
                    General John D. Imboden's account of the First Battle of Bull Run. General
                    Imboden tells of the Staunton Artillery's actions during the battle. In
                    addition, Imboden recalls his duty on the board of officers to investigate and
                    report on whether or not the armies of Johnston and Beauregard should have
                    advanced to Washington following the battle.</p>
<p>FROM the day of his arrival at Winchester, General Johnston was ceaseless in his
                    labors to improve the efficiency of his little army, in which he was greatly
                    assisted by several staff-officers who afterward rose to high distinction. The
                    two most active of these subordinates were Majors W. H. C. Whiting and E. Kirby
                    Smith, the former of whom as a major-general fell mortally wounded at the
                    capture of Fort Fisher in North Carolina, and the latter as a lieutenant-general
                    commanded the Trans-Mississippi army when the final collapse came. During our
                    withdrawal from Harper's Ferry, on June 16th, we were deflected from our direct
                    line of march, and held in line of battle a day at Bunker Hill, a few miles
                    north of Winchester, to receive an expected assault from General Patterson, who
                    had crossed the Potomac, but who went back without attacking us. Again on July
                    2d we were marched to Darksville, about midway to Martinsburg, to meet
                    Patterson, where we lay in line of battle till the 5th, when General Patterson,
                    after a slight "brush" with Jackson, again recrossed the Potomac. We returned to Winchester, and to our arduous
                    drilling.</p>
<p>After midnight of July 17th, General Bee, my brigade commander, sent for me to go
                    with him to headquarters, whither he had been summoned. Several brigade
                    commanders were assembled in a room with General Johnston, and a conference of
                    one or two hours was held. When General Bee joined me on the porch to return to
                    our quarters, I saw he was excited, and I asked him, "What is up?" He took my
                    arm, and, as we walked away, told me we would march next day to the support of
                    General Beauregard. He repeated a telegram General Johnston had received from
                    Adjutant-General Cooper about midnight. This was the famous dispatch that has
                    led to so much controversy between Mr. Davis and General Johnston, as to whether
                    it was a peremptory order, or simply permission to Johnston to go to
                    Beauregard's support. I quote it, and leave the reader to his own construction:</p>
<p>"General Beauregard is attacked; to strike the enemy a decisive blow, a junction
                    of all your effective force will be needed. If practicable, make the movement,
                    sending your sick and baggage to Culpeper Court House, either by railroad or by
                    Warrenton. In all the arrangements exercise your discretion." </p>
<p>On the next day, the 18th of July, we left Winchester for Manassas. It was late
                    in the afternoon before my battery took up the line of march -- as I now
                    recollect, with the rear-guard, as had been the case when we left Harper's Ferry
                    a month before. It was thought probable that Patterson, who was south of the
                    Potomac, and only a few miles distant, would follow us. But J. E. B. Stuart and
                    Ashby with the cavalry so completely masked our movement that it was not
                    suspected by Patterson until July 20th, the day before the Bull Run fight, and
                    then it was too late for him to interfere.</p>
<p>On the second day of the march an order reached me at Rectortown, Virginia,
                    through Brigadier-General Barnard E. Bee, to collect the four field-batteries of
                    Johnston's army into one column, and, as senior artillery captain, to march them
                    by country roads that were unobstructed by infantry or trains as rapidly as
                    possible to Manassas Junction, and to report my arrival, at any hour, day or
                    night, to General Bee, who was going forward by rail with his brigade. Having
                    assembled the batteries in the night, I began the march at dawn of Saturday,
                    July 20th, the day before the battle. About 8 in the morning we reached a
                    village in Fauquier county -- Salem, I think it was. The whole population turned
                    out to greet us. Men, women, and children brought us baskets, trays, and plates
                    loaded with their own family breakfasts. With the improvidence of raw
                    campaigners, we had finished the night before our three days' cooked rations; so
                    I ordered a halt for thirty minutes to enjoy the feast. The Staunton Artillery
                    (my own battery) was at the head of the column, and, being largely composed of
                    young men of high social standing, was especially honored by the ladies of the
                    village, conspicuous among whom were the young daughters of Colonel John A.
                    Washington, late of Mount Vernon. I noticed that some of the young fellows of
                    the battery, lingering round the baskets borne by these young ladies, who bade
                    them die or conquer in the fight, seemed very miserable during the remainder of
                    the march. No doubt many of them, during the battle, felt that it would be
                    better to die on the field than retreat and live to meet those enthusiastic
                    girls again. I make special note of that breakfast because it was the last food
                    any of us tasted till the first Bull Run had been fought and won, 36 hours
                    later.</p>
<p>It was 1 o'clock that night when the head of my little column reached General
                    Bee's headquarters, about one mile north-east of Manassas Junction. He was
                    established in the log-cabin to which afterward he was brought when he was
                    mortally wounded, and to which I shall again allude. General Bee ordered us to
                    unharness the horses and bivouac in the fence corners, adding, "You will need
                    all the rest you can get, for a great battle will begin in the morning."</p>
<p>A little after daybreak we were aroused by the sharp, ringing report of a great
                    Parrott gun across Bull Run, two miles away, and the whizzing of a 30-pounder
                    elongated shell over the tree-tops, 400 or 500 yards to our left. Instantly
                    every man was on his feet, and in five minutes the horses were 
                    harnessed and hitched to the guns and caissons. General Bee beckoned to me to
                    come up to the porch, where he was standing in his shirt-sleeves, having also
                    been aroused by the shot. He rapidly informed me of the disposition of our
                    troops of Johnston's army so far as they had arrived at Manassas. His own
                    brigade had been brought forward by rail the evening before. Above all, he was
                    dissatisfied at the prospect of not participating prominently in the battle,
                    saying that he had been ordered to the Stone Bridge, three or four miles away on
                    our extreme left, to cover the left flank of the army from any movement that
                    might be made against it. And as he had been directed to take a battery with
                    him, he had selected mine, and wished me to move at once. He gave me a guide,
                    and said he would follow immediately with his infantry. When I told him we had
                    been 24 hours without food for men or horses, he said he would order supplies to
                    follow, remarking, "You will have plenty of time to cook and eat, to the music
                    of a battle in which we shall probably take little or no part."</p>
<p>Away we went, retracing our steps to the Junction, and by a westerly detour
                    striking into the Sudley road, at a point half-way between the Junction and the
                    scene of the battle. After an hour or so we ascended the hill to the Lewis
                    house, or "Portici." Here a courier at full speed met us with news that the
                    whole Federal army seemed to be marching north-westerly on the other side of
                    Bull Run. Halting my men, I rode to the top of the hill, and had a full view of
                    a long column of glittering bayonets moving up on the north side of the creek.
                    Glancing down the valley, I saw Bee's brigade advancing, and galloped to meet
                    him and report what I had seen. He divined the plans of  McDowell,
                    and, asking me to accompany him, rode rapidly past the Lewis house, across the
                    hollow beyond it, and up the next hill through the pines, emerging on the summit
                    immediately east of the Henry house. As the beautiful open landscape in front
                    burst upon his vision, he exclaimed with enthusiasm: "Here is the battle-field, and we are in for it! Bring up your
                    guns as quickly as possible, and I'll look round for a good position."</p>
<p>In less than twenty minutes I and my battery had passed the Lewis house, when I
                    discovered Bee coming out of the pines. He stopped, and, placing his cap on his
                    sword-point, waved it almost frantically as a signal to hurry forward. We went
                    at a gallop, and were guided to a depression in the ground about one hundred
                    yards to the north-east of the Henry house, where we unlimbered. With his keen
                    military eye, General Bee had chosen the best possible position for a battery on
                    all that field. We were almost under cover by reason of a slight swell in the
                    ground immediately in our front, and not fifty feet away. Our shot passed not
                    six inches above the surface of the ground on this "swell," and the recoil ran
                    the guns back to still lower ground, where as we loaded only the heads of my men
                    were visible to the enemy.</p>
<p>We went into position none too soon; for, by the time we had unlimbered, Captain
                    Ricketts, appearing on the crest of the opposite hill, came beautifully and
                    gallantly into battery at a gallop, a short distance from the Matthews  house on our side of the Sudley road, and about fifteen hundred
                    yards to our front. I wanted to open on him while he was unlimbering, but
                    General Bee objected till we had received a fire, and had thus ascertained the
                    character and caliber of the enemy's guns. Mine, four in number, were all brass
                    smooth-bore 6-pounders. The first round or two from the enemy went high over us.
                    Seeing this, General Bee directed us to fire low and ricochet our shot and
                    shrapnel on the hard, smooth, open field that sloped toward the Warrenton
                    turnpike in the valley between us. We did this, and the effect was very
                    destructive to the enemy.</p>
<p>The rapid massing of federal troops in our front soon led to very heavy fighting.
                    My little battery was under a pitiless fire for a long time. Two guns from an
                    Alexandria battery -- Latham's, I think -- took part In the conflict on the
                    north side of Young's Branch to our right and across the turnpike, so long as
                    Bee, Bartow, Evans, and Wheat were on that side, we firing over their heads; and
                    about 11 o'clock two brass 12-pounder Napoleons from the New Orleans Washington
                    Artillery unlimbered on our right, retiring, however, after a few rounds.</p>
<p>We were hardly more than fairly engaged with Ricketts when Griffin's splendid
                    battery came to his aid, and took position full five hundred yards nearer to us,
                    in a field on the left of the Sudley road. Ricketts had 6 Parrott guns, and
                    Griffin had as many more, and, I think, 2 12-pounder howitzers besides. These
                    last hurt us more than all the rifles of both batteries, since the shot and
                    shell of the rifles, striking the ground at any angle over 15 or 20 degrees,
                    almost without exception bored their way in several feet and did no harm. It is
                    no exaggeration to say that hundreds of shells from these fine rifle-guns
                    exploded in front of and around my battery on that day, but so deep in the
                    ground that the fragments never came out. After the action the ground looked as
                    though it had been rooted up by hogs. </p>
<p>For at least a half-hour after our forces were driven across Young's Branch no
                    Confederate soldier was visible from our position near the Henry house. The
                    Staunton Artillery, so far as we could see, was "alone in its glory." General
                    Bee's order had been, "Stay here till you are ordered away." To my surprise, no
                    orders had come, though, as I afterward learned, orders to with-draw had been
                    sent three-quarters of an hour before through Major Howard, of Bee's staff, who
                    had fallen, desperately wounded, on the way.</p>
<p>Infantry was now massing near the Stone house on the turnpike, not five hundred
                    yards away, to charge and capture us. On making this discovery and learning from
                    the sergeants of pieces that our ammunition was almost entirely exhausted, there
                    remained but one way to save our guns, and that was to run them off the field.
                    More than half of our horses had been killed, only one or two being left in
                    several of my six-horse teams. Those that we had were quickly divided among the
                    guns and caissons, and we limbered up and fled. Then it was that the Henry house
                    was riddled, and the old lady, Mrs. Henry, was mortally wounded; for our line of
                    retreat was so chosen that for 200 or 300 yards the house would conceal us from
                    Griffin's battery, and, in a measure, shelter us from the dreaded fire of the
                    infantry when they should reach the crest we had just abandoned. Several of
                    Griffin's shot passed through the house, scattering shingles, boards, and
                    splinters all around us. A rifle-shot from Ricketts broke the axle of one of our
                    guns and dropped the gun in the field, but we saved the limber. The charging
                    infantry gained the crest in front of the Henry house in time to give us one
                    volley, but with no serious damage.</p>
<p>We crossed the summit at the edge of the pines, midway behind the Henry and
                    Robinson houses, and there met "Stonewall" Jackson at the head of his brigade,
                    marching by the flank at a double-quick. Johnston and Beauregard had arrived
                    upon the field, and were hurrying troops into position, but we had not yet seen
                    them.</p>
<p>When I met Jackson I felt very angry at what I then regarded as bad treatment
                    from General Bee, in leaving us so long exposed to capture, and I expressed
                    myself with some profanity, which I could see was displeasing to Jackson. He
                    remarked, "I'll support your battery. Unlimber right here." We did so, when a
                    perfect lull in the conflict ensued for 20 or 30 minutes -- at least in that
                    part of the field.</p>
<p>It was at this time that McDowell committed, as I think, the fatal blunder of the
                    day, by ordering both Ricketts's and Griffin's batteries to cease firing and
                    move across the turnpike to the top of the Henry Hill, and take position on the
                    west side of the house. The short time required to effect the change enabled
                    Beauregard to arrange his new line of battle on the highest crest of the hill,
                         south-east of the Henry and Robinson houses, in the edge of
                    the pines. If one of the Federal batteries had been left north of Young's
                    Branch, it could have so swept the hill-top where we re-formed, that it would
                    have greatly delayed, if not wholly have prevented, us from occupying the
                    position. And if we had been forced back to the next hill, on which stands the
                    Lewis house, Sherman, who had crossed Bull Run not far above the Stone Bridge at
                    a farm ford, would have had a fair swing at our right flank, to say nothing of
                    the effect of the artillery playing upon us from beyond Bull Run.</p>
<p>When my retiring battery met Jackson, and he assumed command of us, I reported
                    that I had remaining only three rounds of ammunition for a single gun, and
                    suggested that the caissons be sent to the rear for a supply. He Said, "No not
                    now -- wait till other guns get here, and then you can withdraw your battery, as
                    it has been so torn to pieces, and let your men rest."</p>
<p>During the lull in front, my men lay about, exhausted from want of water and
                    food, and black with powder, smoke, and dust. Lieutenant Harman and I had amused
                    ourselves training one of the guns on a heavy column of the enemy, who were
                    advancing toward us, in the direction of the Chinn house, but were still 1200 to
                    1500 yards away. While we were thus engaged, General Jackson rode up and said
                    that three or four batteries were approaching rapidly, and that we might soon
                    retire. I asked permission to fire the three rounds of shrapnel left to us, and
                    he said, "Go ahead." I picked up a charge (the fuse was cut and ready) and
                    rammed it home myself, remarking to Harman, "Tom, put in the primer and pull her
                    off." I forgot to step back far enough from the muzzle, and, as I wanted to see
                    the shell strike, I squatted to be under the smoke, and gave the word "Fire."
                    Heavens! what a report. Finding myself full twenty feet away, I thought the gun
                    had burst. But it was only the pent-up gas, that, escaping sideways as the shot
                    cleared the muzzle, had struck my side and head with great violence. I recovered
                    in time to see the shell explode in the enemy's ranks. The blood gushed out of
                    my left ear, and from that day to this it has been totally deaf. The men fired
                    the other two rounds, and limbered up and moved away, just as the Rockbridge
                    Artillery, under Lieutenant Brockenbrough, came into position, followed a moment
                    later by the Leesburg Artillery, under Lieutenant Henry Heaton. Pendleton,
                    supposed by me still to be captain of the first, as Rogers was of the second,
                    were not with  their batteries when they unlimbered. But Heaton and
                    Brockenbrough were equal to the occasion. Heaton had been under my command with
                    his battery at the Point of Rocks, below Harper's Ferry, the previous May, and
                    was a brave and skillful young officer. Several other batteries soon came into
                    line, so that by the time Griffin and Ricketts were in position near the Henry
                    house, we had, as I now remember, 26 fresh guns ready for them.</p>
<p>The contest that ensued was terrific. Jackson ordered me to go from battery to
                    battery and see that the guns were properly aimed and the fuses cut the right
                    length. This was the work of but a few minutes. On returning to the left of the
                    line of guns, I stopped to ask General Jackson's permission to rejoin my
                    battery. The fight was just then hot enough to make him feel well. His eyes
                    fairly blazed. He had a way of throwing up his left hand with the open palm
                    toward the person he was addressing. And as he told me to go, he made this
                    gesture. The air was full of flying missiles, and as he spoke he jerked down his
                    hand, and I saw that blood was streaming from it. I exclaimed, "General, you are
                    wounded." He replied, as he drew a handkerchief from his breast-pocket, and
                    began to bind it up, "Only a scratch -- a mere scratch," and galloped away along
                    his line.</p>
<p>To save my horse, I had hitched him in a little gully some fifty yards or more in
                    the rear. And to reach him, I had to pass the six hundred infantry of Hampton's
                    Legion, who were lying down in supporting distance of our artillery, then all in
                    full play. While I was untying my horse, a shell exploded in the midst of
                    Hampton's infantry, killing several and stampeding 15 or 20 nearest the spot. I
                    tried to rally them; but one huge fellow, musket in hand, and with bayonet
                    fixed, had started on a run. I threw myself in his front with drawn sword, and
                    threatened to cut him down, whereupon he made a lunge at me. I threw up my left
                    arm to ward off the blow, and the bayonet-point ran under the wristband of my
                    red flannel shirt, and raked the skin of my arm from wrist to shoulder. The blow
                    knocked me sprawling on the ground, and the fellow got away. I tore off the
                    dangling shirt-sleeve, and was bare-armed as to my left, the remainder of the
                    fight.</p>
<p>I overtook my battery on the hill near the Lewis house, which was used as a
                    hospital. In a field in front I saw General Johnston and his staff grouped on
                    their horses, and under fire from numerous shells that reached that hill. I rode
                    up to him, reported our ammunition all gone, and requested to know where I could
                    find the ordnance wagons and get a fresh supply. Observing the sorry plight of
                    the battery and the condition of the surviving men and horses, he directed me to
                    remove them farther to the rear to a place of perfect safety, and return myself
                    to the field, where I might be of some service.</p>
<p>I took the battery back perhaps a mile, where we found a welcome little stream of
                    water. Being greatly exhausted, I rested for perhaps an hour, and returned to
                    the front with Sergeant Thomas Shumate. </p>
<p>When we regained the crest of the Henry plateau, the enemy had been swept from
                    it, and the retreat had begun all along the line. We gazed upon the scene for a
                    time, and, hearing firing between the Lewis house and the Stone Bridge, we rode
                    back to see what it meant. Captain Lindsay Walker had arrived from
                    Fredericksburg with his six-Parrott-gun battery, and from a high hill was
                    shelling the fugitives beyond Bull Run as they were fleeing in wild disorder to
                    the shelter of the nearest woods. Colonel J. E. B. Stuart, at the head of a body
                    of yelling cavalry with drawn sabers, was sweeping round the base of the hill we
                    were on, to cross the Run and fall upon the enemy.</p>
<p>When Stuart disappeared in the distance, Shumate and I rode slowly back toward
                    the battery. Nearing the Lewis house, we saw General Johnston and his staff
                    coming toward us slowly, preceded a little by a gentleman on horse back, who was
                    lifting his hat to every one he met. From the likeness I had seen of President
                    Jefferson Davis, I instantly recognized him and told Shumate who it was. With
                    the impulsiveness of his nature, Shumate dashed up to the President, seized his
                    hand, and huzzaed at the top of his voice. I could see that Mr. Davis was
                    greatly amused, and I was convulsed with laughter. When they came within twenty
                    steps of me, where I had halted to let the group pass, Shumate exclaimed, to the
                    great amusement of all who heard him: "Mr. President, there's my captain, and I
                    want to introduce you to him." The President eyed me for a moment, as if he
                    thought I was an odd-looking captain. I had on a battered slouch hat, a red
                    flannel shirt with only one sleeve, corduroy trousers, and heavy cavalry boots,
                    and was begrimed with burnt powder, dust, and the blood from my ear and arm, and
                    must have been about as hard-looking a specimen of a captain as was ever seen.
                    Nevertheless, the President grasped my hand with a cordial salutation, and after
                    a few words passed on.</p>
<p>We found our battery refreshing themselves on fat bacon and bread. After a hasty
                    meal, I threw myself on a bag of oats, and slept till broad daylight next
                    morning, notwithstanding a drenching rain which beat upon me during the night.
                    In fact, I was aroused in the morning by a messenger from ex-Governor Alston, of
                    South Carolina, summoning me to the side of my gallant commander,
                    Brigadier-General Bee, who had been mortally wounded near the Henry house, where
                    Bartow had been instantly killed almost at the same moment. When I reached
                    General Bee, who had been carried back to the cabin where I had joined him the
                    night before, he was unconscious; in a few minutes, while I was holding his
                    hand, he died. Some one during the night had told him that I had reflected on
                    him for leaving our battery so long exposed to capture; and, at his request,
                    messengers had been for hours hunting me in the darkness, to bring me to him,
                    that I might learn from his own lips that he had sent Major Howard to order me
                    to withdraw, when was driven back across Young's Branch and the turnpike. I was
                    grieved deeply not to have seen him sooner. Possibly the failure of his, order
                    to reach me was providential. For full three-quarters of an hour we had kept up
                         a fire that delayed the enemy's movement across Young's
                    Branch. But for that, they might have gained the Henry plateau, before Jackson
                    and Hampton came up, and before Bee and Bartow had rallied their disorganized
                    troops. Minutes count as hours under such circumstances, and trifles often turn
                    the scale in great battles.</p>
<p>General Jackson's wound became very serious when inflammation set in. On hearing,
                    three days after the fight, that he was suffering with it, I rode to his
                    quarters, a little farm-house near Centreville. Although it was barely sunrise,
                    he was out under the trees, bathing the hand with spring water. It was much
                    swollen and very painful, but he bore himself stoically. His wife had arrived
                    the night before. Of course, the battle was the only topic discussed at
                    breakfast. I remarked, in Mrs. Jackson's hearing, "General, how is it that you
                    can keep so cool, and appear so utterly insensible to danger in such a storm of
                    shell and bullets as rained about you when your hand was hit?" He instantly
                    became grave and reverential in his manner, and answered, in a low tone of great
                    earnestness: "Captain, my religious belief teaches me to feel as safe in battle
                    as in bed. God has fixed the time for my death. I do not concern myself about
                    that, but to be always ready, no matter when it may overtake me." He added,
                    after a pause, looking me full in the face: "Captain, that is the way all men
                    should live, and then all would be equally brave."</p>
<p>I felt that this last remark was intended as a rebuke for my profanity, when I
                    had complained to him on the field of the apparent abandonment of my battery to
                    capture, and I apologized. He heard me, and simply said, "Nothing can justify
                    profanity."</p>
<p>The battle was mainly fought by Johnston's troops from the Shenandoah. Two-thirds
                    of the killed and wounded were his men and officers. Beauregard's troops were
                    strung out for several miles down the valley of Bull Run, and did not get up to
                    our aid till near the end of the day. General Beauregard himself, who was in the
                    thickest of the fight, came upon the field long before any of his troops
                    arrived, except those he had posted under Evans to guard the Stone Bridge, and
                    which, with Bee's troops, bore the brunt of the first attack. </p>
<p>The uninformed, North and South, have wondered why Johnston and Beauregard did
                    not follow on to Washington. General Johnston, in his "Narrative," has clearly
                    and conclusively answered that question. It was simply impossible. We had
                    neither the food nor transportation at Manassas necessary to a forward movement.
                    This subject was the cause of sharp irritation between our commanding generals
                    at Manassas on the one hand, and Mr. Davis and his Secretary of War, Mr.
                    Benjamin, on the other. There was a disposition in the quartermaster's and
                    commissary departments at Richmond to deny the extent of the destitution of our
                    army immediately after the battle. To ascertain the exact facts of the case,
                    General Johnston organized a board of officers to investigate and report the
                    condition of the transportation and commissariat of the army at Manassas on the
                    21st of July, and their daily condition for two weeks thereafter. That Board was
                    composed of Lieutenant-Colonel Robert B. Lee (a cousin of General R. E. Lee),
                    representing the commissary department, Major (afterward Major-General) W. L.
                    Cabell, representing the quartermaster's department, and myself from the line.
                    My associates on this Board were old United States army officers of acknowledged
                    ability and large experience. We organized early in August, and made an
                    exhaustive investigation and detailed report. I have a distinct recollection
                    that we found that on the morning of the battle there was not at Manassas one
                    full day's rations for the combined armies of Johnston and Beauregard, and that
                    on no single day for the succeeding two weeks was there as much as a three days'
                    supply there. We found that there were not wagons and teams enough at any time
                    to have transported three days' supplies for the troops if they had been put in
                    motion away from the railroad. We found that for weeks preceding the 21st of
                    July General Beauregard had been urgent and almost importunate in his demands on
                    the quartermaster and commissary generals at Richmond for adequate supplies. We
                    found that Colonel Northrop, the commissary general, had not only failed to send
                    forward adequate supplies for such an emergency as arose when General Johnston
                    brought his army from the valley, but that he had interfered with and
                    interdicted the efforts of officers of the department who were with General
                    Beauregard to collect supplies from the rich and abundant region lying between
                    the hostile armies. After reporting the facts, we unanimously concurred in the
                    opinion that they proved the impossibility of a successful and rapid pursuit of
                    the defeated enemy to Washington. This report, elaborately written out and
                    signed, was forwarded to Richmond, and in a few days was returned by Mr. Judah
                    P. Benjamin, Secretary of War, with an indorsement [sic] to the effect that the
                    Board had transcended its powers by expressing an opinion as to what the facts
                    did or did not prove, and sharply ordering us to strike out all that part of the
                    report, and send only the facts ascertained by us. We met and complied with this
                    order, though indignant at the reprimand, and returned our amended report. This
                    was the last I ever heard of it. It never saw daylight. Who suppressed it I do
                    not know.</p>
