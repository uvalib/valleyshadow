                <p><abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Dahlgren</p>
                <p>The whole country laments the death of this gallant officer. The reports from the
                    Kilpatrick expedition involved his fate in mystery, but the Richmond papers bear
                    to us the sad intelligence of his death.</p>
                <p>He had escaped the toils of the enemy in the immediate vicinity of Richmond-his
                    object having been to rescue the Federal prisoners on Belle Island. This he was
                    unable to accomplish on account of the enemy having received intelligence of his
                    purpose; and he was now on the North bank of the Mattapony River, on his way, to
                    Gloucester Point, <orig reg="expecting">excepting</orig> soon to be within the
                    Union lines on the Peninsula. He had, with brave followers, met the enemy four
                    times his own number and had routed them. Now, with devilish cunning they set a
                    snare for him. In his front, in a woods, a woods, a body of men were in ambush
                    awaiting his coming. It was midnight. He was riding at the head of his column;
                    silent but watchful. He heard the rustling of leaves, and observing a rebel
                    ordered him to surrender; the enemy fired a volley of bullets into his ranks,
                    and he fell to the ground a lifeless corpse, his body being pierced by five
                    balls. It was not chivalric, but cowardly, like assassins who are afraid to
                    strike in the open day. It was murder. His men scattered; some escaped and some
                    were taken prisoners. But this is not all.-His uniform was stolen and his dead
                    body shrouded in filthy rebel rags. The finger, on which he wore a valuable
                    ring, was cut off. With fiendish delight they say he was brought to the city and
                    buried-"No one knows, or is to know, where." In life, he frightened the whole
                    city, and the officials shook like aspens. Over the death of this single man
                    they sing <orig reg="paeans">peans</orig> of joy.</p>
                <p>[<abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Dahlgren was the son of the Admiral of that
                    name commanding off Charleston. At the breaking out of the war he held a
                    position in the Navy, but upon application he was appointed an <orig reg="aide"
                        >Aid</orig> in the army, with the rank of Captain. He first served upon the
                    Staff of <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Saxton, then upon <abbr
                        expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Sigel's Staff, and then upon that of <abbr
                        expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Hooker, in command, of the Army of the Potomac.
                    He performed many acts of daring and gallantry. On one <orig reg="occasion"
                        >obcasion</orig>, in the Fall of 1862, he with less than a full company,
                    made a dash into Fredericksburg, and drove out of the streets of that city a
                    much superior force.]</p>
                <p>It was on the morning of July 2nd, 1863, that he first became known to the
                    citizens of Greencastle. With a small band of brave spirits he captured a mail,
                    and picked up prisoners numbering more than his own force. On the morning of the
                    4th, he appeared again, and attempted to capture another mail. With fifteen men
                    he made a charge down South Carlisle street, driving out fifty four rebel
                    cavalrymen. He stayed with us the <pb n="5"/> whole day and enabled us to enjoy
                    a 4th of July without further further interruption, although the whole rebel
                    army was North and East of us. For weeks we had been under the foot of the
                    tyrant. Column after column of the enemy had marched by, and it seemed as if we
                    would never see the end. How long those weeks seemed. We had lived a lifetime in
                    a few days, so great and marvelous had been the changes and events around and
                    among us. The coming of Dahlgren was the first gleam of the sunshine of hope
                    from under the dark lowering cloud of despotism. How bright and beautiful seemed
                    the blue uniforms how gentlemanly the men were; how, more than ever, were
                    detested the filthy garments and the wretched rebels themselves. <abbr
                        expan="Captains">Capts.</abbr> Dahlgren and Cline and <abbr
                        expan="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr> Whitehead, and their gallant men, were our
                    deliverers. The next morning (Sunday) they made a dash on the rebel wagon train
                    then on the retreat. Monday evening, the 6th, Dahlgren led a force into the
                    streets of that town, right into the <orig reg="center">centre</orig>
                    Hagerstown, and made a brilliant charge through the streets of the town, right
                    into the <orig reg="center">centre</orig> of the rebel army. It was there he was
                    afterwards compelled to suffer amputation. For this instance of his bravery he
                    was appointed by the President, <abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> of the Third
                        <abbr expan="United States">U.S.</abbr> Cavalry.</p>
                <p>Although very young, being only 22 years of age, he was distinguished in the army
                    of the <abbr expan="Potomac">
                        <unclear>Potk</unclear>
                    </abbr> and was an officer of lofty courage brilliant and dashing, but without
                    weakness; the very soul of honor quiet but firm; not only admired but loved.</p>
                <p>"A form more active, bright and strong,<lb/> Ne'er shot the ranks of war alon,"</p>
                <p>As <orig reg="grateful">greatful</orig> citizens we can never forget him. Years
                    may pass, but his memory will ever be green in every honest heart.</p>
                <p>"They never fail who die in a great cause<lb/> And they who for their country
                    die,<lb/> Shall fill an honored grave;<lb/> For glory lights the soldier's
                    tomb<lb/> And beauty weeks the brave."</p>
