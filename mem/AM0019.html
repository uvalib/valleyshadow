<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> This detailed account of the author's campaign through Virginia includes
                    discussion of Col. Mosby, famed guerilla leader and an order to burn the
                    countryside he used as a base; the capture of the guerilla leader Gilmore;
                    employing spies; driving Confederates out of the Valley entirely; and the Battle
                    of Waynesboro. It also mentions Custer's capture of Charlottesville and the
                    surrender of the University of Virginia.</p>

                    POTOMAC.</p>
<p>Early's broken army practically made no halt in its retreat after the battle of
                    Cedar Creek until it reached New Market, though at Fisher's Hill was left a
                    small rear-guard of cavalry, which hastily decamped, however, when charged by
                    Gibbs's brigade on the morning of the 20th. Between the date of his signal
                    defeat and the 11th of November, the enemy's scattered forces had sufficiently
                    reorganized to permit his again making a reconnoissance in the valley as far north as Cedar Creek, my army
                    having meanwhile withdrawn to Kernstown, where it had been finally decided that
                    a defensive line should be held to enable me to detach troops to General Grant,
                         and where, by reconstructing the Winchester and Potomac
                    railroad from Stephenson's depot to Harper's Ferry, my command might be more
                    readily supplied. Early's reconnoissance north
                    of Cedar Creek ended in a rapid withdrawal of his infantry after feeling my
                    front, and with the usual ill-fortune to his cavalry; Merritt and Custer driving
                    Rosser and Lomax with ease across Cedar Creek on the Middle and Back roads,
                    while Powell's cavalry struck McCausland near Stony Point, and after capturing
                    two pieces of artillery and about three hundred officers and men chased him into
                    the Luray Valley.</p>
<p>Early got back to New Market on the 14th of November, and, from lack of
                    subsistence, being unable to continue demonstrations to prevent my reinforcement
                    of General Grant, began himself to detach to General Lee by returning Kershaw's
                    division to Petersburg, as was definitely ascertained by Torbert in a reconnoissance to Mount Jackson. At this time
                    General Grant wished me to send him the Sixth Corps, and it was got ready for
                    the purpose, but when I informed him that Torbert's reconnoissance had developed the fact that Early still retained four
                    divisions of infantry and one of cavalry, it was decided, on my suggestion, to
                    let the Sixth Corps remain till the season should be a little further advanced,
                    when  the inclemency of the weather would preclude infantry
                    campaigning. These conditions came about early in December, and by the middle of
                    the month the whole of the Sixth Corps was at Petersburg; simultaneously with
                    its transfer to that line Early sending his Second Corps to Lee.</p>
<p>During the entire campaign I had been annoyed by guerrilla bands under such
                    partisan chiefs as Mosby, White, Gilmore, McNeil, and others, and this had
                    considerably depleted my line-of-battle strength, necessitating as it did large,
                    escorts for my supply-trains. The most redoubtable of these leaders was Mosby,
                    whose force was made up from the country around Upperville, east of the Blue
                    Ridge, to which section he always fled for a hiding-place when he scented
                    danger. I had not directed any special operations against these partisans while
                    the campaign was active, but as Mosby's men had lately killed, within my lines,
                    my chief quartermaster, Colonel Tolles, and Medical Inspector Ohlenchlager, I
                    concluded to devote particular attention to these "irregulars" during the lull
                    that now occurred; so on the 28th of November, I directed General Merritt to
                    march to the Loudoun Valley and operate against Mosby, taking care to clear the
                    country of forage and subsistence, so as to prevent the guerrillas from being
                    harbored there in the future,  their destruction or capture being
                    well-nigh impossible, on account of their intimate knowledge of the mountain
                    region. Merritt carried out his instructions with his usual sagacity and
                    thoroughness, sweeping widely over each side of his general line of march with
                    flankers, who burned the grain and brought in large herds of cattle, hogs and
                    sheep, which were issued to the troops.</p>
<p>While Merritt was engaged in this service the Baltimore and Ohio railroad once
                    more received the attention of the enemy; Rosser, with two brigades of cavalry,
                    crossing the Great North Mountain, capturing the post of New Creek, with about
                    five hundred prisoners and seven guns, destroying all the supplies of the
                    garrison, and breaking up the railroad track. This slight success of the
                    Confederates in West Virginia, and the intelligence that they were contemplating
                    further raids in that section, led me to send Crook there with one division, his
                    other troops going to City Point; and I hoped that all the threatened places
                    would thus be sufficiently protected, but negligence at Beverly resulted in the
                    capture of that station by Rosser on the 11th of January.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, Early established himself with Wharton's division at Staunton
                    in winter quarters, posting his cavalry in that neighborhood  also,
                    except a detachment at New Market, and another small one at the signal-station
                    on Three Top Mountain. The winter was a most severe one, snow falling frequently
                    to the depth of several inches, and the mercury often sinking below zero. The
                    rigor of the season was very much against the success of any mounted operations,
                    but General Grant being very desirous to have the railroads broken up about
                    Gordonsville and Charlottesville, on the 19th of December I started the cavalry
                    out for that purpose, Torbert, with Merritt and Powell, marching through Chester
                    Gap, while Custer moved toward Staunton to make a demonstration in Torbert's
                    favor, hoping to hold the enemy's troops in the valley. Unfortunately, Custer
                    did not accomplish all that was expected of him, and being surprised by Rosser
                    and Payne near Lacy's Springs before reveille, had to abandon his bivouac and
                    retreat down the valley, with the loss of a number of prisoners, a few horses,
                    and a good many horse equipments, for, because of the suddenness of Rosser's
                    attack, many of the men had no time to saddle up. As soon as Custer's retreat
                    was assured, Wharton's division of infantry was sent to Charlottesville to check
                    Torbert, but this had already been done by Lomax, with the assistance of
                    infantry sent up from Richmond. Indeed,  from the very beginning of
                    the movement the Confederates had been closely observing the columns of Torbert
                    and Custer, and in consequence of the knowledge thus derived, Early had marched
                    Lomax to Gordonsville in anticipation of an attack there, at the same time
                    sending Rosser down the valley to meet Custer. Torbert in the performance of his
                    task captured two pieces of artillery from Johnson's and McCausland's brigades,
                    at Liberty Mills on the Rapidan River, but in the main the purpose of the raid
                    utterly failed, so by the 27th of December he returned, many, of his men badly
                    frost-bitten from the extreme cold which had prevailed.</p>
<p>This expedition practically closed all operations for the season, and the cavalry
                    was put into winter cantonment near Winchester. The distribution of my infantry
                    to Petersburg and West Virginia left with me in the beginning of the new year,
                    as already stated, but the one small division of the Nineteenth Corps. On
                    account of this diminution of force, it became necessary for me to keep
                    thoroughly posted in regard to the enemy, and I now realized more than I had
                    done hitherto how efficient my scouts had become since under the control of
                    Colonel Young; for not only did they bring me almost every day intelligence from
                    within Early's lines, but they also operated effi-ciently against
                    the guerrillas infesting West Virginia.</p>
<p>Harry Gilmore, of Maryland, was the most noted of these since the death of
                    McNeil, and as the scouts had reported him in Harrisonburg the latter part of
                    January, I directed two of the most trustworthy to be sent to watch his
                    movements and ascertain his purposes. In a few days these spies returned with
                    the intelligence that Gilmore was on his way to Moorefield, the centre of a very disloyal section in West Virginia,
                    about ninety miles southwest of Winchester, where, under the guise of a
                    camp-meeting, a gathering was to take place, at which he expected to enlist a
                    number of men, be joined by a party of about twenty recruits coming from
                    Maryland, and then begin depredations along the Baltimore and Ohio railroad.
                    Believing that Gilmore might be captured, I directed Young to undertake the
                    task, and as a preliminary step he sent to Moorefield two of his men who early
                    in the war had "refugeed" from that section and enlisted in one of the Union
                    regiments from West Virginia. In about a week these men came back and reported
                    that Gilmore was living at a house between three and four miles from Moorefield,
                    and gave full particulars as to his coming and going, the number of men he had
                    about there and where they rendezvoused.</p>
<p>With this knowledge at hand I directed Young to take twenty of his best men and
                    leave that night for Moorefield, dressed in Confederate uniforms, telling him
                    that I would have about three hundred cavalry follow in his wake when he had got
                    about fifteen miles start, and instructing him to pass his party off as a body
                    of recruits for Gilmore coming from Maryland and pursued by the Yankee cavalry.
                    I knew this would allay suspicion and provide him help on the road; and, indeed,
                    as Colonel Whittaker, who alone knew the secret, followed after the fleeing
                    "Marylanders," he found that their advent had caused so little remark that the
                    trail would have been lost had he not already known their destination. Young met
                    with a hearty, welcome wherever he halted on the way, and as he passed through
                    the town of Moorefield learned with satisfaction that Gilmore still made his
                    headquarters at the house where the report of the two scouts had located him a
                    few days before. Reaching the designated place about 12 o'clock on the night of
                    the 5th of February, Young, under the representation that he had come directly
                    from Maryland and was being pursued by the Union cavalry, gained immediate
                    access to Gilmore's room. He found the bold guerrilla snugly tucked in bed, with
                    two pistols lying on a chair near by. He was sleeping  so soundly
                    that to arouse him Young had to give him a violent shake. As he awoke and asked
                    who was disturbing his slumbers, Young, pointing at him a cocked six-shooter,
                    ordered him to dress without delay, and in answer to his inquiry, informed him
                    that he was a prisoner to one of Sheridan's staff. Meanwhile Gilmore's men had
                    learned of his trouble, but the early appearance of Colonel Whittaker caused
                    them to disperse; thus the last link between Maryland and the Confederacy was
                    carried a prisoner to Winchester, whence he was sent to Fort Warren.</p>
<p>The capture of Gilmore caused the disbandment of the party he had organized at
                    the "camp-meeting," most of the men he had recruited returning to their homes
                    discouraged, though some few joined the bands of Woodson and young Jesse McNeil,
                    which, led by the latter, dashed into Cumberland, Maryland, at 3 O'clock on the
                    morning of the 21st of February and made a reprisal by carrying off General
                    Crook and General Kelly, and doing their work so silently and quickly that they
                    escaped without being noticed, and were some distance on their way before the
                    colored watchman at the hotel where Crook was quartered could compose himself
                    enough to give the alarm. A troop of cavalry gave hot chase from Cumberland,
                    striving to intercept the party at Moorefield  and other points,
                    but all efforts were fruitless, the prisoners soon being beyond reach.</p>
<p>Although I had adopted the general rule of employing only soldiers as scouts,
                    there was an occasional exception to it. I cannot say that these exceptions
                    proved wholly that an ironclad observance of the rule would have been best, but
                    I am sure of it in one instance. A man named Lomas, who claimed to be a
                    Marylander, offered me his services as a spy, and coming highly recommended from
                    Mr. Stanton, who had made use of him in that capacity, I employed him. He made
                    many pretensions, often appearing over anxious to impart information seemingly
                    intended to impress me with his importance, and yet was more than ordinarily
                    intelligent, but in spite of that my confidence in him was by no means
                    unlimited. I often found what he reported to me as taking place within the
                    Confederate lines corroborated by Young's men, but generally there were
                    discrepancies in his tales, which led me to suspect that he was employed by the
                    enemy as well as by me. I felt, however, that with good watching he could do me
                    little harm, and if my suspicions were incorrect he might be very useful, so I
                    held on to him.</p>
<p>Early in February Lomas was very solicitous for me to employ a man who, he said,
                    had been  with Mosby, but on account of some quarrel in the
                    irregular camp had abandoned that leader. Thinking that with two of them I might
                    destroy the railroad bridges east of Lynchburg, I concluded, after the Mosby man
                    had been brought to my headquarters by Lomas about 12 o'clock one night, to give
                    him employment, at the same time informing Colonel Young that I suspected their
                    fidelity, however, and that he must test it by shadowing their every movement.
                    When Lomas's companion entered my room he was completely disguised, but on
                    discarding the various contrivances by which his identity was concealed he
                    proved to be a rather slender, dark-complexioned, handsome young man, of easy address and captivating
                    manners. He gave his name as Renfrew, answered all my questions satisfactorily,
                    and went into details about Mosby and his men which showed an intimacy with them
                    at some time. I explained to the two men the work I had laid out for them, and
                    stated the sum of money I would give to have it done, but stipulated that in
                    case of failure there would be no compensation whatever beyond the few dollars
                    necessary for their expenses. They readily assented, and it was arranged that
                    they should start the following night. Meanwhile Young had selected his men to
                    shadow them, and in two  days reported my spies as being concealed
                    at Strasburg, where they remained, without making the slightest effort to
                    continue on their mission, and were busy, no doubt, communicating with the
                    enemy, though I was not able to fasten this on them. On the 16th of February
                    they returned to Winchester, and reported their failure, telling so many lies
                    about their hazardous adventure as to remove all remaining doubt as to their
                    double-dealing. Unquestionably they were spies from the enemy, and hence liable
                    to the usual penalties of such service; but it struck me that through them, I
                    might deceive Early as to the time of opening the spring campaign, I having
                    already received from General Grant an intimation of what was expected of me. I
                    therefore retained the men without even a suggestion of my knowledge of their
                    true character, Young meanwhile keeping close watch over all their doings.</p>
<p>Toward the last of February General Early had at Staunton two brigades of
                    infantry under Wharton. All the rest of the infantry except Echol's brigade,
                    which was in southwestern Virginia, had been sent to Petersburg during the
                    winter, and Fitz. Lee's two brigades of cavalry also. Rosser's men were mostly
                    at their homes, where, on account of a lack of subsistence and 
                    forage in the valley, they had been permitted to go, subject to call. Lomax's
                    cavalry was at Millboro', west of Staunton, where supplies were obtainable. It
                    was my aim to get well on the road before Early could collect these scattered
                    forces, and as many of the officers had been in the habit of amusing themselves
                    fox-hunting during the latter part of the winter, I decided to use the hunt as
                    an expedient for stealing a march on the enemy, and had it given out officially
                    that a grand fox-chase would take place on the 29th of February. Knowing that
                    Lomas and Renfrew would spread the announcement South, they were permitted to
                    see several red foxes that had been secured, as well as a large pack of hounds
                    which Colonel Young had collected for the sport, and were then started on a
                    second expedition to burn the bridges. Of course, they were shadowed as usual,
                    and two days later, after they had communicated with friends from their
                    hiding-place, in Newtown, they were arrested. On the way north to Fort Warren
                    they escaped from their guards when passing through Baltimore, and I never heard
                    of them again, though I learned that, after the assassination of Mr. Lincoln,
                    Secretary Stanton strongly suspected his friend Lomas of being associated with
                    the conspirators, and it then occurred to me that the good-looking Renfrew may
                         have been Wilkes Booth, for he certainly bore a strong
                    resemblance to Booth's pictures.</p>
<p>On the 27th of February my cavalry entered upon the campaign which cleared the
                    Shenandoah Valley of every remnant of organized Confederates. General Torbert
                    being absent on leave at this time, I did not recall him, but appointed General
                    Merritt Chief of Cavalry, for Torbert had disappointed me on two important
                    occasions-in the Luray Valley during the battle of Fisher's Hill, and on the
                    recent Gordonsville expedition-and I mistrusted his ability to conduct any
                    operations requiring much self-reliance. The column was composed of Custer's and
                    Devin's divisions of cavalry, and two sections of artillery, comprising in all
                    about 10,000 officers and men. On wheels we had, to accompany this column, eight
                    ambulances, sixteen ammunition wagons, a pontoon train for eight canvas boats,
                    and a small supply-train, with fifteen days' rations of coffee, sugar, and salt,
                    it being intended to depend on the country for the meat and bread ration, the
                    men carrying in their haversacks nearly enough to subsist them till out of the
                    exhausted valley.</p>
<p>Grant's orders were for me to destroy the Virginia Central railroad and the James
                    River canal, capture Lynchburg if practicable, and then join General Sherman in
                    North Carolina wherever he  might be found, or return to
                    Winchester, but as to joining Sherman I was to be governed by the state of
                    affairs after the projected capture of Lynchburg. The weather was cold, the
                    valley and surrounding mountains being still covered with snow; but this was
                    fast disappearing, however, under the heavy rain that was coming down as the
                    column moved along up the Valley pike at a steady gait that took us to Woodstock
                    the first day. The second day we crossed the North Fork of the Shenandoah on our
                    pontoon-bridge, and by night-fall reached Lacy's Springs, having seen nothing of
                    the enemy as yet but a few partisans who hung on our flanks in the afternoon.</p>
<p>March 1 we encountered General Rosser at Mt. Crawford,
                    he having been able to call together only some five or six hundred of his
                    troops, our unsuspected march becoming known to Early only the day before.
                    Rosser attempted to delay us here, trying to burn the bridges over the Middle
                    Fork of the Shenandoah, but two regiments from Colonel Capehart's brigade swam
                    the stream and drove Rosser to Kline's Mills, taking thirty prisoners and twenty
                    ambulances and wagons.</p>
<p>Meanwhile General Early was busy at Staunton, but not knowing my objective point,
                    he had ordered the return of Echol's brigade from southwest-ern
                    Virginia for the protection of Lynchburg, directed Lomax's cavalry to
                    concentrate at Pond Gap for the purpose of harassing me if I moved toward
                    Lynchburg, and at the same time marched Wharton's two brigades of infantry,
                    Nelson's artillery, and Rosser's cavalry to Waynesboro', whither he went also to
                    remain till the object of my movement was ascertained.</p>
<p>I entered Staunton the morning of March 2, and finding that Early had gone to
                    Waynesboro' with his infantry and Rosser, the question at once arose whether I
                    should continue my march to Lynchburg direct, leaving my adversary in my rear,
                    or turn east and open the way through Rockfish Gap to the Virginia Central
                    railroad and James River canal. I felt confident of the success of the latter
                    plan, for I knew that Early numbered there not more than two thousand men; so,
                    influenced by this, and somewhat also by the fact that Early had left word in
                    Staunton that he would fight at Waynesboro', I directed Merritt to move toward
                    that place with Custer, to be closely followed by Devin, who was to detach one
                    brigade to destroy supplies at Swoope's depot. The by-roads were miry beyond
                    description, rain having fallen almost incessantly since we left Winchester, but
                    notwithstanding the down-pour the column pushed on, men and horses growing
                        al-most unrecognizable from the mud covering them from head to
                    foot.</p>
<p>General Early was true to the promise made his friends in Staunton, for when
                    Custer neared Waynesboro' he found, occupying a line of breastworks on a ridge
                    west of the town, two brigades of infantry, with eleven pieces of artillery and
                    Rosser's cavalry. Custer, when developing the position of the Confederates,
                    discovered that their left was somewhat exposed instead of resting on South
                    River; he therefore made his dispositions for attack, sending around that flank
                    the dismounted regiments from Pennington's brigade, while he himself, with two
                    brigades, partly mounted and partly dismounted, assaulted along the whole line
                    of breastworks. Pennington's flanking movement stampeded the enemy in short
                    order, thus enabling Custer to carry the front with little resistance, and as he
                    did so the Eighth New York and First Connecticut, in a charge in column, broke
                    through the opening made by Custer, and continued on through the town of
                    Waynesboro', never stopping till they crossed South River. There, finding
                    themselves immediately in the enemy's rear, they promptly formed as foragers and
                    held the east bank of the stream till all the Confederates surrendered except
                    Rosser, who succeeded in making his way back to the  valley, and
                    Generals Early, Wharton, Long, and Lilley, who, with fifteen or twenty men,
                    escaped across the Blue Ridge. I followed up the victory immediately by despatching Capehart through Rockfish Gap, with
                    orders to encamp on the east side of the Blue Ridge. By reason of this move all
                    the enemy's stores and transportation fell into our hands, while we captured on
                    the field seventeen battle flags, sixteen hundred officers and men, and eleven
                    pieces of artillery. This decisive victory closed hostilities in the Shenandoah
                    Valley. The prisoners and artillery were sent back to Winchester next morning,
                    under a guard of 1,500 men, commanded by Colonel J. H. Thompson, of the First
                    New Hampshire.</p>
<p>The night of March 2 Custer camped at Brookfield, Devin remaining at Waynesboro'.
                    The former started for Charlottesville the next morning early, followed by Devin
                    with but two brigades, Gibbs having been left behind to blow up the iron
                    railroad bridge across South River. Because of the incessant rains and spring
                    thaws the roads were very soft, and the columns cut them up terribly, the mud
                    being thrown by the sets of fours across the road in ridges as much as two feet
                    high, making it most difficult to get our wagons along, and distressingly
                    wearing on the animals toward the middle and rear of the columns. Conse-quently I concluded to rest at Charlottesville for a couple of days
                    and recuperate a little, intending at the same time to destroy, with small
                    parties, the railroad from that point toward Lynchburg. Custer reached
                    Charlottesville the 3d, in the afternoon, and was met at the outskirts by a
                    deputation of its citizens, headed by the mayor, who surrendered the town with
                    medieval ceremony, formally handing over the keys of the public buildings and of
                    the University of Virginia. But this little scene did not delay Custer long
                    enough to prevent his capturing, just beyond the village, a small body of
                    cavalry and three pieces of artillery. Gibbs's brigade, which was bringing up my
                    mud-impeded train, did not arrive until the 5th of March. In the mean time
                    Young's scouts had brought word that the garrison of Lynchburg was being
                    increased and the fortifications strengthened, so that its capture would be
                    improbable. I decided, however, to move toward the place as far as Amherst Court
                    House, which is sixteen miles short of the town, so Devin, under Merritt's
                    supervision, marched along the James River, destroying the canal, while Custer
                    pushed ahead on the railroad and broke it up. The two columns were to join at
                    New Market, whence I intended to cross the James River at some point east of
                    Lynchburg, if practicable, so as to make  my way to Appomattox
                    Court House, and destroy the Southside railroad as far east as Farmville. Owing
                    to its swollen condition the river was unfordable, but knowing that there was a
                    covered bridge at Duguidsville, I hoped to secure it by a dash, and cross there,
                    but the enemy, anticipating this, had filled the bridge with inflammable
                    material, and just as our troops got within striking distance it burst into
                    flames. The bridge at Hardwicksville also having been burned by the enemy, there
                    was now no means of crossing except by pontoons. But, unfortunately, I had only
                    eight of these, and they could not be made to span the swollen river.</p>
<p>Being thus unable to cross until the river should fall, and knowing that it was
                    impracticable to join General Sherman, and useless to adhere to my alternative
                    instructions to return to Winchester, I now decided to destroy still more
                    thoroughly the James River canal and the Virginia Central railroad and then join
                    General Grant in front of Petersburg. I was master of the whole country north of
                    the James as far down as Goochland; hence the destruction of these arteries of
                    supply could be easily compassed, and feeling that the war was nearing its end,
                    I desired my cavalry to be in at the death.</p>
<p>On March 9 the main column started eastward  down the James River,
                    destroying locks, dams, and boats, having been preceded by Colonel Fitzhugh's
                    brigade of Devin's division in a forced march to Goochland and Beaver Dam Creek,
                    with orders to destroy everything below Columbia. I made Columbia on the 10th,
                    and from there sent a communication to General Grant reporting what had
                    occurred, informing him of my condition and intention, asking him to send forage
                    and rations to meet me at the White House, and also a pontoon-bridge to carry me
                    over the Pamunkey, for in view of the fact that hitherto it had been
                    impracticable to hold Lee in the trenches around Petersburg, I regarded as too
                    hazardous a march down the south bank of the Pamunkey, where the enemy, by
                    sending troops out from Richmond, might fall upon my flank and rear. It was of
                    the utmost importance that General Grant should receive these despatches without chance of failure, in order that
                    I might depend absolutely on securing supplies at the White House; therefore I
                    sent the message in duplicate, one copy overland direct to City Point by two
                    scouts, Campbell and Rowan, and the other by Fannin and Moore, who were to go
                    down the James River in a small boat to Richmond, join the troops in the
                    trenches in front of Petersburg, and, deserting to the Union lines, deliver
                    their tidings into General Grant's  hands. Each set of messengers
                    got through, but the copy confided to Campbell and Rowan was first at Grant's
                    headquarters.</p>
<p>I halted for one day at Columbia to let my trains catch up, for it was still
                    raining and the mud greatly delayed the teams, fatiguing and wearying the mules
                    so much that I believe we should have been forced to abandon most of the wagons
                    except for the invaluable help given by some two thousand negroes who had
                    attached themselves to the column: they literally lifted the wagons out of the
                    mud. From Columbia Merritt, with Devin's division, marched to Louisa Court House
                    and destroyed the Virginia Central to Frederick's Hall. Meanwhile Custer was
                    performing similar work from Frederick's Hall to Beaver Dam Station, and also
                    pursued for a time General Early, who, it was learned from despatches captured in the telegraph office at
                    Frederick's Hall, was in the neighborhood with a couple of hundred men. Custer
                    captured some of these men and two of Early's staff-officers, but the commander
                    of the Valley District, accompanied by a single orderly, escaped across the
                    South Anna and next day made his way to Richmond, the last man of the
                    Confederate army that had so long contended with us in the Shenandoah Valley.</p>
<p>At Frederick's Hall, Young's scouts brought me  word from Richmond
                    that General Longstreet was assembling a force there to prevent my junction with
                    Grant, and that Pickett's division, which had been sent toward Lynchburg to
                    oppose my march, and Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry, were moving east on the Southside
                    railroad, with the object of circumventing me. Reasoning that Longstreet could
                    interpose effectually only by getting to the White House ahead of me, I pushed
                    one column under Custer across the South Anna, by way of Ground Squirrel bridge,
                    to Ashland, where it united with Merritt, who had meanwhile marched through
                    Hanover Junction. Our appearance at Ashland drew the Confederates out in that
                    direction, as was hoped, so, leaving Colonel Pennington's brigade there to amuse
                    them, the united command retraced its route to Mount Carmel church to cross the
                    North Anna. After dark Pennington came away, and all the troops reached the
                    church by midnight of the 15th.</p>
<p>Resuming the march at an early hour next morning, we took the road by way of King
                    William Court House to the White House, where, arriving on the 18th, we found,
                    greatly to our relief, the supplies which I had requested to be sent there. In
                    the meanwhile the enemy had marched to Hanover Court House, but being unable
                    either to cross the Pamunkey there or fore-stall me at the White
                    House on the south side of the river, he withdrew to Richmond without further
                    effort to impede my column.</p>
<p>The hardships of this march far exceeded those of any previous campaigns by the
                    cavalry. Almost incessant rains had drenched us for sixteen days and nights, and
                    the swollen streams and wellnigh bottomless roads east of Staunton presented
                    grave difficulties on every hand, but surmounting them all, we destroyed the
                    enemy's means of subsistence, in quantities beyond computation, and permanently
                    crippled the Virginia Central railroad, as well as the James River canal, and as
                    each day brought us nearer the Army of the Potomac, all were filled with the
                    comforting reflection that our work in the Shenandoah Valley had been thoroughly
                    done, and every one was buoyed up by the cheering thought that we should soon
                    take part in the final struggle of the war.</p>
