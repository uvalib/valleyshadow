<h3 class="section-head">Franklin County: "The Border War Claims," by A. K. McClure, 1905</h3>
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> McClure describes his efforts as a member of the Pennsylvania legislature to
                    secure relief for Chambersburg after the town was burned in McCausland's raid.
                    He explains that corruption delayed and then greatly detracted from the relief
                    which finally came, and bemoans that corruption was so much a part of this
                    period of Pennsylvanian history.</p>

                    the Appropriation of Half a Million Dollars Was Passed a Year Later.</p>
<p>THE McCausland raid that destroyed the beautiful town of Chambersburg was the
                    last visitation the people of that section had from the opposing armies of our
                    civil war. General Patterson's army, the first to march against the South in the
                    Shenandoah Valley, in the early spring of 1861, encamped on my farm at
                    Chambersburg, and made that his base for a week or more. That occupation saved
                    me the trouble of harvesting luxuriant fields of clover and timothy, as all the
                    fields in grass were occupied by the army and the crops destroyed. In 1862
                    General Stuart made the first great raid of the war around McClellan's army
                    after the battle of Antietam, and spent the night in Chambersburg, as I have
                    already fully described, leaving me minus ten horses. His raid was followed by
                    what were always the most destructive military movements in our valley, with the
                    single exception of the burning of Chambersburg, the invasion of the militia or
                    emergency men, suddenly called out to protect the border, pitched together into
                    companies and regiments without discipline, and hurriedly marched away without
                    quartermaster  or commissary resources. They practically lived on
                    the country, and they were necessarily very costly visitors.</p>
<p>In 1863 two-thirds of Lee's army had its base in Chambersburg for nearly a week,
                    and Ewell's corps of over 20,000 men followed all previous military forces by
                    camping on some 200 acres of level ground on my farm, with railroad on one side
                    and water on the other. Lee's army, however, was under the strictest discipline,
                    and Ewell's entire corps, or most of it, was on the farm for a week; and the
                    officers occupied my residence, but they did much less damage than a single
                    regiment of New York volunteers encamped on the same place, who were the first
                    to reach Chambersburg after the battle of Gettysburg. The middle fences had then
                    been destroyed by both armies, and the only crop that I was enabled to gather
                    from the farm during the war was a bountiful harvest in 1864, that was entirely
                    destroyed in the barn a few weeks after its harvesting.</p>
<p>The people of Chambersburg were left in a most destitute condition by the
                    destruction of the town on the 30th of July, 1864. Nearly or quite two-thirds of
                    the population were entirely homeless, without means and without the occupations
                    which afforded them a livelihood. The people of the State responded very
                    generously in sending supplies, but with more than 2,000 people entirely
                    homeless and breadless there was often want in many family circles. I had a
                    large corn and potato crop that had escaped the vengeance of McCausland, and as
                    rapidly as these crops matured sufficiently for family use they were delivered
                    from day to day to the sufferers until the last pound had gone, beyond a scant
                    allowance for my own household. Unfortunately, we were then in the high tide of
                    war inflation, when a dollar of current money bought no more, than two-thirds
                    its face value in labor or neces-saries of life, but the business
                    men who had means or credit hastily began the reconstruction of their homes and
                    business places, costing them quite double what the properties commanded when
                    many were forced to sell by the revulsion that followed.</p>
<p>The people were inspired by the hope that the Legislature would come to their
                    relief to a very generous extent, and, as I have explained in a former chapter,
                    J. McDowell Sharpe, who stood at the front of the Chambersburg bar, and myself
                    had been elected to the house and charged with the responsible duty of obtaining
                    relief for our people who were struggling in the ashes of their desolated homes.
                    Sharpe and I, of course, had but a single purpose in shaping our legislative
                    actions, and that was to successfully perform the paramount duty of obtaining
                    relief for our neighbors. At the meeting of the Legislature on the first Tuesday
                    of January, 1865, we agreed that we must subordinate all political efforts to
                    the exceptionally grave duty imposed upon us; that we would take no part in
                    political disputation; that our attitude on all legislative questions should be
                    governed by the advantage we could command for the passage of the relief bill.
                    The house was largely Republican, and of course Sharpe, being the leading
                    Democrat of the body, was voiceless in shaping its organization; but Olmsted, of
                    Potter, was made speaker without a contest by the Republican friends of the
                    border claim giving him a united support. He was a man of the highest character,
                    and all we asked of him was an entirely fair committee to pass upon our
                    important measure, to which he readily assented and fulfilled his promise. He
                    was not asked to pledge himself to support the bill, as such a proposition would
                    have been offensive to one of his delicate appreciation of official pride, but
                    we had the assurance of absolute fairness, and hoped to have him with us  when the struggle came, although his constituents were very
                    generally against us.</p>
<p>Before the Legislature met distant portions of the State, which were at no time
                    imperiled by the Civil War, were inflamed to a considerable degree against our
                    relief bill by the united efforts of demagogues and lobbyists. It must be
                    remembered that at that day the sum of $500,000 to be taken from the treasury
                    for appropriation outside of the ordinary expenses of the State was a startling
                    proposition, and candidates for the Legislature in very many of the districts
                    openly pledged themselves against what they called the border raid bill, to
                    secure their election in doubtful districts, or to assure their renominations
                    where elections were not doubtful. The entire northern tier of counties, then
                    almost wholly agricultural, and where extreme frugality was the rule of the
                    every-day lives of the people, were appalled by the proposition to take half a
                    million dollars from the treasury of the State. Their farms were then taxed to
                    support the Commonwealth, and $500,000 at that time seemed to be a vastly
                    greater sum than $5,000,000 would seem to-day.</p>
<p>Pittsburg was then in the violent throes of the
                    railroad repudiation struggle that convulsed the people of Allegheny for many
                    years, and their legislators had little sympathy with their brethren from the
                    southern border, because their revolutionary movement had commanded little
                    sympathy or support from any portion of the State east of the Alleghenies. Thus,
                    a large portion of the members of the Legislature appeared at Harrisburg
                    strongly prejudiced against any important border relief bill because of
                    political or local interests, and the professional lobbyists of the State, who
                    then embraced a number of able and unscrupulous men, aided systematically in
                    prejudicing legislators against our measure, hoping to obtain a large  corruption fund to be used by them in securing votes for the bill,
                    with large profits to the lobbyists themselves. When we appeared at Harrisburg
                    to inaugurate the struggle for the relief of Chambersburg, we were amazed to
                    learn that a decided majority of the house was not only not in sympathy with us,
                    but positively against us, and many of the members very aggressively so.</p>
<p>It was this condition that brought into political prominence William H. Kemble,
                    as he was made State treasurer by a combination between his Philadelphia friends
                    and the organized supporters of the relief bill. I had known Kemble in a casual
                    way for several years, but never had opportunity to know him beyond the flippant
                    surface that he so often maintained, hiding his very strong natural abilities
                    from all but those who knew him most intimately. We had some twenty Republican
                    members of the house who immediately represented the border people, or who were
                    sufficiently interested in the work of furnishing relief, to make them cordially
                    co-operate with any movement deemed necessary to promote the passage of a
                    liberal appropriation. Philadelphia representatives were nearly all Republican,
                    and they had been thoroughly organized to make battle for the election of Kemble
                    as State treasurer. His competitor was Dr. Gross, of
                    Allegheny, who had served several sessions in the house, was a man of the
                    highest character, of admitted ability, and universally respected by all who
                    knew him. Under ordinary circumstances he would have been nominated for State
                    treasurer, and would have filled the office with great credit, but the
                    proposition came to us to give the support of the Republican representatives of
                    Philadelphia for the border relief bill if we would unite with them to make
                    Kemble State treasurer.</p>
<p>The proposition was first made to me by ex-Representative Thorne, with whom I had
                    served in the house some years, and who was a devoted personal friend. He came
                    to Chambersburg and made the proposition that a combination be made between the
                    border and Philadelphia Republicans to make Kemble treasurer and to pass the
                    relief bill. I was greatly surprised when he named Kemble as his candidate, as I
                    had only the merest superficial knowledge of the man, and when he first told me
                    that the Philadelphians were unitedly and earnestly for him, and that we could
                    not expect a general or cordial support for our relief bill from Philadelphia
                    without the border people supporting him, my answer was: "Well, if you people
                    can stand it, I can," and the combination was made and carried out with absolute
                    fidelity on both sides. But for this alliance with Philadelphia the Chambersburg
                    relief bill never would have been permitted to appear even on the house
                    calendar.</p>
<p>I learned to know Kemble better after he came into the office of State treasurer,
                    and to appreciate his exceptionally great qualities. He was at times impulsive
                    and indiscreet, but he discharged his official duties with great fidelity, and
                    he started the important tax reform relieving the farmers of the State entirely
                    from taxation for State purposes and imposing it upon the then rapidly
                    developing corporations. He became a recognized leader not only in State
                    politics, but in finance, and was the chief author of the pecuniary success
                    attained by our various city passenger railways. He was the best equipped man in
                    passenger railway business not only in Philadelphia, but in any other section of
                    the country, and he was unfaltering in his fidelity to personal or political
                    friendships. He was twice re-elected State treasurer by the Legislature, and
                    left the office at the expiration of three years with the  credit
                    of the State fully restored, and our general financial condition immeasurably
                    improved.</p>
<p>Never did two men more earnestly struggle for the relief of their constituents
                    than did Sharpe and myself at that session of the Legislature, but before a
                    month of the session had passed it became obvious to us that success was not
                    within the range of possibility. The measure was assailed by a large number of
                    the rural newspapers, and the powerfully organized lobbyists who then clustered
                    about legislative sessions were aggressively hostile because there was nothing
                    in it for them. Sharpe and I made every combination within range to aid or
                    hinder legislation if thereby there was a promise made for our single cause.
                    Political disputation ran high in both senate and house, but we were stubbornly
                    silent. As Sharpe was altogether the ablest member of the Democratic minority,
                    his political friends complained somewhat that he was never heard in the
                    political scraps that so often happened in which he would have been their ablest
                    champion. Finally we reached the proposed amendment to the Constitution of the
                    United States for the abolishment of slavery, and the debate on it was
                    altogether the most embittered of the session. Just when it was at the
                    high-water mark of partisan frenzy, the Democrats demanded that Sharpe should be
                    heard, and I had been also urged to participate in the debate on the other side.
                    I saw that the Democrats, where we had our largest support for the relief bill
                    outside of Philadelphia members, were determined to have Sharpe speak, and I
                    passed over to his seat and proposed that I would take the floor in support of
                    the anti-slavery amendment, and that he should follow; that we would both
                    deliver dignified addresses which would not be likely to call out violent
                    interruption or criticism, and that after the delivery of the speeches we would
                    then  resume our attitude of absolute refusal to participate in
                    political discussion. It soon became known that Sharpe and I had taken a
                    temporary release from our bondage on political discussion, and, as the subject
                    had already crowded the house with interested spectators, the senate soon
                    adjourned for want of a quorum, and the Governor and heads of departments and
                    senators crowded into the hail. Sharpe's speech,
                    although entirely spontaneous, was the ablest political address I ever heard him
                    deliver, and his friends were greatly gratified. He was thoroughly familiar with
                    the subject, as he had discussed the question very fully time and again on the
                    stump, and he rose to the highest measure of his great ability on the sudden
                    inspiration of a party call that he knew demanded of him an argument fully
                    worthy of himself. He was one of the few members of the bar who presented the
                    uncommon quality of perfectly blending all the attributes of a great lawyer with
                    all the attributes of a brilliant advocate, and he was one of the gentlest and
                    most lovable of men.</p>
<p>Hopeless as was the position of the Chambersburg measure, we could only struggle
                    to the end, although it was during the last month of the session, simply the
                    struggle of despair, and the Legislature finally adjourned without any
                    appropriation whatever for the relief of the impoverished people of the burned
                    town. While the leading men of Chambersburg were fully advised of the progress
                    of the battle, and knew that the defeat of the bill was inevitable, the majority
                    of the people in their extreme necessities, struggling like the drowning man
                    grasping at the straw, hoped even against hope that they would not be entirely
                    abandoned by the State, and when the Legislature finally adjourned without even
                    seriously considering the relief measure their disappointment was as terrible as
                    it was  general. Sharpe and I were in constant intercourse with the
                    leading men of the town, and they knew long before the session ended that
                    $500,000 could not be taken from the treasury of the State, even for the most
                    deserving charity, without passing through the slimy embrace of a powerful and
                    unscrupulous lobby. There were many conferences after the adjournment of the
                    Legislature between the active citizens of the town, which Sharpe and I
                    attended, and we both stated frankly that the appropriation that was absolutely
                    indispensable to Chambersburg could not be obtained by any combination of
                    personal or political interests, and that it could be accomplished only by
                    yielding to corruption that was then largely asserting its mastery in
                    Pennsylvania politics, and especially in legislation; and it was finally
                    definitely decided to organize a movement at once to obtain the appropriation
                    from the succeeding Legislature, and a dozen or more of those who had sustained
                    the heaviest losses, and who, as a rule, could best afford to dispense with
                    relief, should give their entire portion of the appropriation to promote its
                    passage. The result was that new men were sent to the Legislature, and the
                    battle for the relief of Chambersburg was made outside of the legislative halls.
                    The measure passed both branches of the Legislature and was approved by Governor
                    Curtin, and thus half a million came at last to the relief of the
                    long-despairing sufferers of Chambersburg, less a considerable sum that was
                    filched from them by lobby extortion and Legislative venality.</p>
<p>A number of the heaviest losers did not receive one dollar, and I not only
                    received no part of mine, which was the largest claim in the entire list, but in
                    a severe emergency in the progress of the conflict I gave $2,500 in addition,
                    not a dollar of which was ever repaid, or expected to be repaid; but with all
                    these resources,  we were unable to meet the ever-increasing demand
                    of organized corruption. Finally I presented the matter to Colonel Scott, then
                    vice-president of the Pennsylvania Railroad, who was a native of Franklin
                    County, and had great affection for the people of the desolated town. He
                    understood the situation at a glance, knew the forces which surrounded and the
                    obstacles which confronted it, and he gave a peremptory order to his
                    representative at Harrisburg to pass the Chambersburg relief bill under any and
                    all circumstances. But for his timely and most generous interposition and
                    substantial aid, the relief bill would not have reached final passage. Beyond
                    half a dozen men, who participated in the inner movements of the struggle, the
                    people of Chambersburg received the liberal appropriation of the State without
                    ever having heard the name of Colonel Scott mentioned as their chief benefactor.</p>
<p>I should not have given any part of the inner story of the passage of the
                    Chambersburg relief bill, but for the fact that it seems to be a necessity to
                    maintain the truth of history, and in some future chapter I must discuss the
                    question of corruption in Pennsylvania politics, especially in Pennsylvania
                    legislation. I have given the facts in relation to the relief bill because it
                    was an imperious necessity that the relief should be obtained, and a like
                    imperious necessity that some should assume the responsibility of submitting to
                    the demands of corruptionists to give success to a measure that was a naked
                    charity. I served in nine sessions of the two branches of the Legislature,
                    covering a period of sixteen years, and during the time that Legislative
                    venality reached its high-water mark. I do not mean that Pennsylvania politics
                    are any less corrupt now than they were then, but I think it is due to truth to
                    say that the general individual venality in legislation these days does not
                    approach the measure of venality  that obtained during a portion of
                    the time in which I served in the Legislature.</p>
<p>There was then no such thing known as the power of party leaders to pass or
                    defeat measures of legislation which were not political, and venality became so
                    general because of the vast power of the Legislature to promote individual and
                    corrupt interests by special legislation under the old Constitution. Private
                    legislation was practically ended by the Constitution of 1874, and petty
                    venality that had become so general under the former Constitution was largely
                    dethroned. Now, measures of individual profit are scaled on an immense basis;
                    they are passed or defeated in our Pennsylvania Legislature largely or wholly as
                    party leaders command, and the petty Legislative speculations of a few hundreds
                    of dollars which were common in early times have now given way to colossal
                    speculations by political leaders, and a small portion of the profits is
                    gradually filtered down to the followers to enable them to keep their positions.
                    It is a sorry chapter to appear in the annals of our great Commonwealth, but the
                    history of our political, industrial and financial achievements would be
                    incomplete with its omission.</p>
