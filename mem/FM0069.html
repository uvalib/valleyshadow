                            by B.J. Bolding, B.D., 1906</h3>
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> A black minister in Franklin County refutes the recent arguments of a white
                    minister in Franklin County about the supremacy of the white race, using both
                    biblical and scientific arguments.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>"He meets the foe with voice and pen,<br> With eloquence surprising!<br> Give
                    us a chance, for we are men!<br> My brethren! we are rising."<br> GEORGE C.
                    ROWE.</p>
<p>It is the misfortune of Afro-Americans to live amongst a people whose laws,
                    traditions, and prejudices have been against them for centuries. Some white
                    people dislike us because we were once slaves and have not been able in these
                    few years of freedom to release ourselves from all the baneful effects of
                    slavery; others are against us because of our color; and still others hate us
                    because we exist and succeed in spite of all their efforts to down us. Indeed we
                    are surrounded with prejudices on all sides. Many bitter and malicious things
                    have been said and written by our enemies in order to retard our progress and to
                    increase the size and venom of the slimy serpent of prejudice, but it has fallen
                    to the lot of Rev. G.C.H. Hasskarl, Chambersburg,
                        Pa., to strike the hardest blow, and to
                    manifest the most malevolent spirit in such malicious business.</p>
<p>One can hardly imagine that a man with any degree of intelligence, with the facts
                    of history before him and with such illustrious examples of intelligence and
                    moral manhood in ebony hue on every side could have made such statements  as are contained in the articles published in the Chambersburg
                    Democratic News. Rev. Hasskarl is not only color
                    blind, but prejudice blind. However, the Afro-Americans everywhere can
                    felicitate themselves in the fact that they have a young man in the person of
                        Rev. B. J. Bolding, to defend the race against
                    the attacks of this arch enemy. Dr. Bolding has
                    proved himself more than a match for his opponent. In a speech at Asbury Park
                    Auditorium before the New Jersey State Convention of Christian Endeavors.
                    September 15, '98, speaking of the controversy I said:
                        Rev. Hasskarl asserts that the colored people
                    are not human beings, but beasts, that Adam and Eve were not their fore-parents;
                    that they were created priorto them, at the time the beasts of the field were
                    created, and that they entered the ark not as men, but as monkeys and by a
                    system of evolution through the ages have developed into the resemblance of men.
                    He deplores all efforts to develop them morally and spiritually because they
                    have no souls. He declares all of this in the face of the fact that we look like
                    men, talk like men, think like men, walk like men, love like men, worship like
                    men, have a human anatomical construction and possess all the attributes of
                    human beings.</p>
<p>The amusing part of the affair is, however, that the learned doctor is in a
                    controversy with a learned beast, according to his theory, a graduate of one of
                    the best equipped universities of the country. He is making it pretty lively for
                    the learned gentleman. Dr. Bolding has the better of
                    the argument, so far as logic  is concerned. If the ability to think,
                    reason and will is the line of demarkation between the man and the beast, then I
                    am sure in this instance the <u>Beast</u> is not <u>Black</u>. Rev. Bolding
                    was ordained by me at annual Conference at York, Pa. He has very successfully pastored every charge to which he has been
                    assigned. He is the author of "Inspiration of the Scriptures" and "Church
                    Unity." He was educated at Howard University, Temple College and The Divinity
                    School of Philadelphia. He is statistical secretary of the Philadelphia and
                    Baltimore Conference A.M.E.

<p>Long may the author of this pamphlet live to defend his race and be a blessing to
                    humanity.</p>

<p>I have read carefully a series of articles under the caption, "What of the Negro
                    Race?" by Rev. G.C.H. Hasskarl, D.C.L., pastor of
                    the second Lutheran Church, Chambersburg, Pa.
                    On behalf of my race and the great interest manifested in them by the good
                    philanthropists of this country, I cannot refrain from replying to his argument
                    from a scientific and ethnological standpoint.</p>
<p>(A) The colonization scheme of Bishop Turner does not voice the sentiment of the
                    educated men of our race. If the Negro should emigrate to Africa they would have
                    to build two walls. One to keep from all there and another to keep the white man
                    out. I do not favor the Negro going to Africa no more than for the Irish to go
                    back to Ireland and the German to Germany, etc. We asked not to come here. Our
                    labor for 250 years have tilled the soil, cleared the forest and materially
                    assisted in advancing higher civilization. I shall not enter too far into that
                    part of Mr. Hasskarl's argument but shall come at once to the question at issue.
                    "What of  the Negro Race?" Ethnologists are generally agreed that the
                    Negro is the descendant of Ham. The Holy Scriptures say "And the whole earth was
                    ofone language, and of one speech." Gen. 11:1. This
                    assertion of the sacred record in relation to men at a period not much later
                    than the Deluge and before the commencement of the abortive effort which
                    rendered Babel so memorable, reveals a fact precisely such as we might look for
                    if the Deluge was literally universal, and if "Noah only remained alive, and
                    they that were with him in the ark." Gen. 7:23. For
                    plainly in that case all the growing population subsequent to that catastrophy,
                    must have sprung from Noah and his three sons; they must have been of one and
                    the same stock, and they must, therefore, all have been originally of "one
                    language and of one speech."</p>
<p>(B) This passage in Genesis must refer to the entire population of the globe at
                    that time. It cannot be restricted to any one particular land or country and to
                    some one tribe or nation occupying that one specified district. <u>All</u> the circumstances of the case forbid such
                    restriction. This declaration stands as introductory to the record of the
                    building of the tower of Babel, the confounding of the language of those so
                    employed and their consequent separation into several branches or communities
                    each speaking its own peculiar  language unintelligable to the
                    others, and of the after settlement ofthese several bands of colonists in
                    different countries; by all which the ultimate peopling of the whole earth was
                    secured. This separation of the earth's population, or this "dividing of the
                    earth," as the sacred penman calls it, took place "in the days of Peleg" whose
                    birth is recorded Gen. 10:25. It has therefore,
                    been concluded that the confounding of man's language at Babel which led to the
                    dispersion, took place not very long after the Deluge, and at a time when the
                    post-deluvian population might readily have numbered several thousand.</p>
<p>This oneness of the primitive language spoken by the entire post-deluvian
                    population of the earth, up to the days of Peleg, is one of the proofs going to
                    show that to this day it is true, <u>Man</u> is one
                    family. I will admit, Mr. Hasskarl, that there is great diversity marking what
                    are called the several races of mankind, the entire population of the globe even
                    now, is sprung from the same stock. All men of all nations and countries,
                    whatever be the shade of their complexion, the difference in their features,
                    their anatomical structure, their habits and their intellectual capacity-the
                    Negro, the Caucasian, the Mongol, the Malay are each and all descendants of the
                    one original human pair, Adam and Eve, in the line of  Noah and his
                    three sons who with their wives were the sole survivors of the Deluge. They all
                    constitute One Family. They all sprung from Eve e.i.
                    Life, so named on that very account that she was to be the mother of all living,
                        Gen. 6:20, just as it is declared in the book
                    of Acts 17:26, "God hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on
                    all the face of the earth." Such is the view the Bible presents, such is the
                    view we hold and shall maintain. That man is from one common parent.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>I desire now to show that the former inhabitants of our world are known to us by
                    three kinds of evidence.</p>
<p>(1) Written Records; (2) Architectural Monuments; (3) Fragmentary Remains.</p>
<p>The true source of history comes from written records. The oldest existing books
                    are the Hebrew Scriptures, which alone of ancient writings describe the
                    separation of the earth for the abode of man; his creation and primeval
                    innocence; the entrance of sin into the world and the promise of Redemption; the
                    first probation and the almost total destruction of the human race by a flood;
                    the vain attempt  of Noah's descendants to avert similar punishment
                    by building a "City and tower whose top should reach into heaven," and their
                    consequent dispersion. The Bible lays the foundation of all subsequent history
                    by sketching the division of the human race into three great families and
                    describing their earliest migrations. As I shall endeavor to follow the Hamitic
                    thread, I shall not trace the other two main divisions of the human family. (A)
                    The descendants of Ham settled in the valleys of Tigris and Euphrates, they
                    built the cities of Ninevah and Babylon; while the rest spread along the eastern
                    and southern shores of the Mediterranean and became the founders of the Egyptian
                    Empire. The Hamitic nations were distinguished by their material grandeur, as
                    exemplified by the enormous masses of stone employed in their architecture, and
                    even in their sculpture.</p>
<p>(2) Africa the ancestral home of the Negro, is almost wholly within the tropics,
                    only a small portion of its northern and southern extremities entering the two
                    temperate zones, where their climate is most nearly torrid. Before the conquest
                    by the Persians northern Africa was divided between five nations, the Egyptians,
                    Ethiopians, Phoenicians, Libyans and Greeks. The Ethiopians occupied the Nile
                    valley above Egypt, including what is now  known as Abyssinia. Meroe
                    was the chief city of the Ethiopians. Archeologists claim for some of their
                    monuments more antiquity than those of Egypt. Arabian traditions say that the
                    inhabitants of the Northern coast of Africa were descendants of the Canaanites
                    whom the children of Israel drove out of Palestine, descendants of Canaan, son
                    of Ham, upon whomNoah put the curse. "Cursed be Canaan, a servant or servants
                    shall he be unto his brethren." Gen. 9:25. From the
                    logic of historical facts the Negro is the true descendant of Ham and a part of
                    the great Hamitic race. Gen. 10:6, "The sons of
                    Ham: Crush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan." The Holy Scriptures say "These
                    are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their
                    countries, and in their nations." Gen. 10:20. It is
                    quite evident that there was a difference between each son's descendants.</p>
<p>The learned Doctor endeavors to make us believe that the Negro got his origin
                    from the monkey.</p>
<p>"Nature will perpetuate varieties, for this is in accordance with her operations;
                    but refuses to multiply hybrids, for this is contrary to her laws."-<u>Dr. Bachman. The following are
                        the conclusions to which Dr. Bachman.</u> The
                    following are the conclusions to which Dr. Bachman
                    believes himself incontrovertibly led by the facts in regard to animals:-</p>
<p>"1.-Nature, in all her operations, by  the peculiar organization of
                    each species-by their instinctive repugnance to an association by the
                    infertility of a hybrid production, when by art or accident this takes place-and
                    by the extinction of these hybrids in a very short period of time, gives us the
                    most indubitable evidence that the creation of species is an act of Divine power
                    alone, and cannot be effected by any other means.</p>
<p>"2.-That no race of animals has ever sprung from a commingling of two or more
                    species.</p>
<p>"3.-Domestication, in every species that has been brought under subjection,
                    produces striking and often permanent varieties, but has never evolved a faculty
                    to produce fertile hybrids.</p>
<p>"4.-Since no two species of animals have ever been known to produce a prolifie
                    hybird race, therefore hybridity is a test of specific character.</p>
<p>"5.-Consequently the fact that all the races of mankind produce with each other a
                    fertile progeny, by which means new varieties have been produced in every
                    country; constitutes one of the most powerful and undeniable arguments in favor
                    of the unity of the races"</p>
<p>If the monkey could have been found that was capable of intellectuality; and the
                    power of memory, will, attention or perception then we would see some analogy
                    between them and other intelligiences.  The monkey is the same old
                    monkey he was the day he went into the ark. Since this law of uniform, permanent
                    and natural propagation has been made by God an invariable mark of specific
                    difference among all other animals it follows, that, as the present inhabitants
                    of the earth are made up of races formed by the amalgamation of many varieties,
                    the human family must be of one species. I entertain a high respect for the
                    talents and the attainments of Rev. Hasskarl. In
                    any department of mere science <u>probably</u> the
                    learned gentleman's opinion <u>might</u> be entitled to
                    profound deference. <u>"Humanum est errare et
                    nescire"</u> is an old adage but I believe it to be true, especially in Dr. Hasskarl's case. But, my friend, to consider your
                    argument and take <u>you</u> as an expounder of the
                    Sacred records of our faith you stand before us shorn of your strength. To
                    sustain a PET THEORY, you would arbitrarily impose a new and unnatural
                    interpretation on several passages of the Bible, which present a totally
                    different meaning <u>Made of one blood</u>" has,
                    according to him no relation at all to affinity by blood or natural descent.
                    This passage of the book of Acts the Apostle refers very evidently to the record
                    of the early colonization and settling of the earth which is contained in the
                    books of Moses. Some Greek copies preserve only the word evos. i.e. 
                    one, leaving out aiuatog, i.e. blood-a reading which the Latin Vulgate follows.
                    The Arabic version, to explain both these terms, has <u>ex
                        homine</u>, or as De Dieu renders it, <u>ex Adamo
                    uno</u>-there being but the difference of one letter in the Eastern languages
                    between dam and Adam, the one denoting blood and the other man. But if we take
                    this passage as our more ordinary copies read it, e evos aiuatog, i.e. of one
                    blood, it is still equally plain that the meaning of the apostle is not that all
                    mankind were made of the same uniform matter, or in the same mould as some have
                    weakly imagined; for, on that ground, not only mankind but the whole earth might
                    be said to be <u>ex henos haimatos</u>, i.e. of the same
                    blood, since all things in the world were first formed out of the same matter.
                    The word aiua, namely blood, must therefore be here rendered in the same sense
                    as that in which it occurs in the best Greek authors--namely the stock out of
                    which men come. The apostle's meaning, therefore, is, that however men now are
                    dispersed in their habitations and however much they differ in language and
                    customs from each other, they are all originally of the same stock, and derive
                    their succession from the first man whom God created, that is, from Adam, from
                    whose name the Hebrew word for blood-i.e. dam-is a derivative 
                    Physiology supplies a remarkable proof of this declaration of Scripture. Our
                    Saviour said, "But from the beginning of the creation, God them male and female;
                    for this cause shall made them male and female; for this cause shall a man leave
                    father and mother and cleave unto his wife." Man's nature possesses in itself
                    all that is beautiful and inanimate nature, the life and growth of plants, the
                    higher powers of beasts, the reason and wisdom of angels, and the moral
                    lineaments of Deity.</p>
<p>In treating of man's specific character, they have regard only to his animal
                    organization and nature. But while this might be permitted when the object is
                    merely to accommodate the convenience of scientific analysis yet when we come to
                    speak of man practically, and in view of his relations to God and to his fellow
                    men, it is altogether inadmissible. "Man, as he is, as he lives, moves, acts,
                    thinks, and wills, is not an animal." The Negro as we know him and see him in
                    the light of this 19th century civilization is not an animal. The <u>learned Doctor</u> says he has no soul and in the next
                    few sentences describes in him the attributes of the soul. What composes a soul?
                    Look again, Doctor in your psychology and you will find that knowledge, feeling
                    and will, are its main divisions. Knowing is an intellectual process, involving
                    psychical laws. It is an activity which the "Ego" experiences.  I am
                    not talking of the Negro in history but of the personal self, the ego. Now if I
                    have no "psyche" then the lessons I have learned in mental philosophy is of no
                    effect to me. There is hardly an intelligent argument on this point, because
                    ocular demonstration will convince even as fool that black is black and white is
                    white. Therefore the Negro as he moves, thinks or wills is <u>not an animal</u>. He is more, inconceivablymore. Every
                    one must admit and feel that it is not in man's animal frame, exquisite as is
                    its workmanship, that we find the most remarkable of the human phenomena. All
                    must admit that there is in man an element remarkably distinct from all his
                    other functions, an essence whose property is <u>thought</u>. What gives to this animal frame its chief importance is, that
                    it is the shrine of that mysterious principle which lies hidden within-that
                    volatile element which no chemist has been able to detect-that impossible thing
                    which has escaped the scalpel of the most minute anatomist-that which, itself
                    invisible, gives to the eye all its diversified expression, revealing itself
                    there in a thousand intimations-which transfuses itself into the voice,
                    inspiring its ever-changing intonations, and rendering it the conveyancer to
                    others of the endless series of thoughts and which imparts to every variety of
                    feature and gesture all that it has of life,  and interest, and
                    expression. "The Ethiopians (Cushites) were distinct from the Egyptians with
                    dark complexions, thick lips and sloping profiles. Their descent from Ham is
                    distinctly asserted in Gen. 10:6. Egyptian
                    civilization was readily received among them but suffered deterioration in the
                    process and failed to raise the race very much above the savage condition."
                    There were times when Ethiopia, that is, the ancient kingdom of Askum in
                    Abayssina--threatened to become one of the "Great Powers" of the Eastern world;
                    but some inherent weakness caused it to relapse, after each success into a
                    comparatively unimportant position.</p>
<p>(1.) <u>Philological Idea</u>-For ages the friends of the
                    "Unity of the Human Races" appeal to the results of a careful comparison of
                    languages by which it is shown that "all language throughout the whole world,
                    present so close an analogy the one to the other, and exhibit so many points of
                    resemblance notwithstanding the vast diversity among them, that the ablest
                    investigators of the subject have concluded that all languages must have been
                    originally united in one, whence they draw the common elements to them all and
                    the separation between them could not be made by any gradual departure, or
                    individual development; but it must have been brought about by some violent,
                    unusual, active force, sufficient alone to  reconcile these
                    conflicting appearances and to account at once for the resemblances and the
                    differences. Language is at once the <u>sign</u> and the
                        <u>means</u> of man's control of the brute creation,
                    it is the analogue of his judgment and reason both of which would be crippled
                    without it. This is one of all ordinary human faculties which men in all ages
                    have been inclined to accept as most nearly divine. "But it is a striking,
                    though commonplace fact, that while the vocal organs of men are the same the
                    world over, the forms of human speech are many and various. Now the Negro speaks
                    and as far as we can ascertain, he always spoke. These are facts but what
                    explains the diversity? Did mankind ever speak one language of which all
                    existing tongues are variations? Can any language now different be proven to
                    have been originally identical, subsequently differentiating on explicable
                    principles? These are the great questions the facts suggest.</p>
<p>A language is not a science. The Bible says "The whole earth was of one language
                    and of one speech." By linguistic research, furthermore we can determine the
                    civilization and to some extent the habitation of the original race. If the
                    Sanskrit word for yoke is "yuga," the Latin "jugum," the German "jock," it is
                    tolerably evident that the ancestors of all these nations knew what a yoke was.
                    If we can prove  the idenity of the Sanskrit "gau," the Greek
                    "bonus," the German "kuh," and the English cow, it is reasonably certain that
                    most Indo-Europeans were acquainted with horned cattle. By this process a
                    surprising amount of information has been gained." Now if Prof. Cole is right in this relation in languages,
                    I claim that the Negro was a member of the speaking family from creation. I ask
                    you to more thoroughly go with me into the great field of philology. The fact,
                    then, that notwithstanding the prevailing diversity of languages, there are so
                    many points of resemblance among all known languages, resemblances which present
                    and themselves the more numerous the more striking the further philologists
                    extend their researches, does to one who <u>duty</u>
                    reflects on the <u>reflects</u> of language and
                    appreciates the philosophical character of the structure of language, present a
                    strong case in evidence of a common origin for them all and with it a powerful
                    argument for the common origin of all the now widely differing races of men.</p>
<p>Rejoinder No. 1 from Rev. G.C.H. Hasskarl, D.C.L.,
                    was more than a surprise to me and the readers of this discussion. All of his
                    reasons donot make a point on the subject "What of the Negro Race?" Dr. Hasskarl you must remember that personal opinions
                    are not argument and <u>truth</u> is <u>light</u> but <u>reason</u> rules
                    the world. If you do not put your rejoinders on higher intellectual grounds I
                    will be compelled to ceasewriting because I would underrate myself and my
                    "Alma-Mater."</p>
<p><u>Reason</u> and <u>free
                    inquiry</u> are the only effectual antidotes of error. Give them full scope,
                    and they will uphold the truth, by bringing false opinions and all the <u>spurious</u> offspring of ignorance, prejudice and
                    self-interest, before their severe tribunal and subjecting them to the test of
                    close investigation.</p>
<p><u>Error</u> alone needs artificial support; truth can
                    stand by itself. That the Negro had his origin in the first man, I believe I
                    have clearly proven from Scripture and Philology in my previous article, at any
                    rate I shall endeavor to present the Anthropological and ethical ideas of man to
                    you. We desire to show that the negro has a <u>soul</u>
                    and a personality both of which, Dr. G.C.H.
                    Hasskarl, D.C.L., pastor 2nd Lutheran church Chambersburg Pa., denies him. The word man is derived  from the Greek "<u>Anthropos</u>," and I
                    shall treat the word in this sense.</p>
<p>The consideration of the elements of <u>human
                    personality</u> as given, (the negro certainly has this), the complete
                    representation of which belongs to anthropology and psychology is inseparable
                    from the admission, that they are destined to an entirely different development
                    from mere natural necessity. Dr. Hasskarl says in
                    article 6, "that the negro is wanting in personality, and soulless," and in the
                    next seven lines he says he "existed." "Falsehood is the mother of invention."
                    As the creature formed in the image of God, a man (Anthropos) whether he be
                    black or white, is being possessed of soul and body, a union of mind and nature,
                    which is not like the divine life indissoluble (Heb. 7), but shall only become an indissoluble life in a future, more
                        <u>perfect</u> existence.</p>
<p>Logic is derived from the Greek "Logos" and in the sense used by Plato, it means
                    whatever pertains to the <u>Mind</u>, the <u>Reason</u>, the immaterial power or faculty which is
                    manifested in the words and speech of men. Logic was used to denote the whole of
                    what, in modern times has been called Intellectual Philosophy or Metaphysics.
                    But Intellectual Philosophy or Metaphysics, in this <u>broad</u> extent of meaning includes at least three distinct departments of
                    science.</p>
<p>(1) Psychology, as it is called, describing the facts of the mind, of which we
                    are immediately conscious, such as Sensation, Perception, Abstraction, Memory,
                    Conception, Intuition and Judgment.</p>
<p>(2) Metaphysics proper, which investigates the necessary <u>a
                        prior</u> condition and laws of thought and the ideas which determined
                    cognition and judgment, and those necessary axioms or first principles, which
                    are assumed in all sciences and underlie them, as the ground of their
                    possibility and reality. And.</p>
<p>(3) Logic: which treats of the relations of conceptions to one another; the
                    deduction of secondary from primary and intuitive judgments, and the laws of
                    Synthesis, by which truths are constructed into systems. Logic <u>may be</u> defined as the science of <u>Deductive Thinking</u>. I give these clear definitions
                    to refute the claim that the Negro is not a human personality and soulless.</p>
<p>The <u>mind</u> is the portion of our being superior to
                    sense, which connects itself with the world of ideas and with God, and the
                    element of which is the general and universal; it is the <u>kindly</u> principal in <u>man</u> which gives
                    him the stamp of sovereignty and by means of which he exercises dominion over
                    the earth, and make discoveries in arts and science. The body which according to
                    the expression of Scripture, is taken  from the earth, "is the
                    contrast of the mind or spirit appointed to be its ministering instrument. But
                    my learned Doctor the <u>soul</u> is the bond of union
                    between mind and body, and as the union of both, it is two-fold, so that it has
                    at once a natural (physical) side-the seat of which, according to Scripture, is
                    in the <u>blood</u>-and an intellectual side. Through the
                    soul, the mind corresponds with the body, and the body with the mind; and
                    between mind, soul, and body there is constant mutual intercourse; of which
                        <u>every person</u> may be convinced by daily
                    experience. The highest destiny of man is not his sovereign relation towards
                    nature, but his relation of love and service towards <u>God</u> and his <u>neighbor</u>, which can only be
                    accomplished in the soul; and it is the perfection of the mind to combine with
                    the soul, by which, in truth, it first becomes human." It is clearly seen that
                    the "<u>pet theory</u>" of our learned Doctor is
                    illogical and <u>incompetent</u> to sustain itself under
                    the searchlight of truth. The Negro has proven that he has a <u>mind</u> that is capable of the highest developments.
                    Give the Negro an equal chance in the race of life and remove the barriers of
                    prejudice he will demonstrate his kingly power of mind. Has the Negro a soul? I
                    answer unhesitatingly yes for it is the soul that <u>loves</u> and is loved. For mere genius we have respect, and bow before it,
                         but we find there no bosom whereon to rest. In the soul, on the
                    other hand, we can place confidence, and for it we can conceive affection, and
                    look for its sympathy in return. The soul can sympathize both with the
                    intellectual and what is apparent to the senses the heavenly and the earthly,
                    the infinite and the finite because it is itself the marvelous central being
                    which is the union of both. The divine "Logos" Jesus Christ, had a human soul so
                    that he could have sympathy with <u>our</u> infirmities
                    and draw us to Himself. It will not take a philosopher to discern that the Negro
                    has will, sentiment or perception. The faculties of the soul are delineated in
                        Dr. Hasskarl's argument. If the Negro has these
                    elements or attributes of the soul he must according to logic have a soul. I
                    believe that souls are created. "Every man is an eternal individuality framed in
                    the image of God, and bears within <u>himself</u> the
                    possibility of eternal life in bliss; he is not merely a continuing link in the
                    long series of the human race, a repetition of what has gone before with
                    inherited properties, but moreover at the same time a fresh point of
                    commencement in this series." When the chains of slavery clanked on our ankles
                    and the cry of mothers and fathers could be heard the South the slaveowner
                    allowed religious instruction, (though meager),. to be given their 
                    slaves. They believed that the Negro had a soul and some owners felt it their
                    duty to teach them there was a God and they had souls to save. They were taught
                    that while the body belongs <u>me</u> your owner, your
                    soul belongs to God and is destined for heaven or hell.</p>
<p>It is a matter of little concern to me whether I am a descendant of Adam or no, I
                    know that I live, move, feel and enjoy all the advantages of the soul. But when
                    a philosopher, and minister of the gospel strikes at my people I cannot keep
                    silent. You may not be able to find traditional or history to cover my argument
                    outside of the Bible. Why? Because white men wrote the history and had no
                    special interest to serve. The truth is that all men descended from the dark
                    race. The first man Adam was not a white man. You cannot prove it from the Bible
                    history nor tradition. As to the <u>origin</u> of man, or
                    of the inferior creation, reason can furnish no decision. This is a point beyond
                    the legitimate range of scientific investigation. The existence, the distinctive
                    characteristics, the qualities, the habits, the locality, and the mutual
                    relations one to another, of the several races of man, and of the fauna and the
                    flora of the several regions, or zoological provinces where these different
                    races of man are found are all subjects for scientific research and scientific
                    reasoning  But the ORIGIN of things-of the lowest brute and of the
                    meanest herb,just as truly as of man himself, lies beyond human observation and
                    human consciousness. No <u>mortal</u> was present at the
                    creation to witness the modeor the place in which any creature originated. No
                    mortal has ever seen a new order of plants or of animals brought into existence.
                    Animals and plants, and different varieties of men are found existing in certain
                    localities, possessed of certain distinctive qualities, and exhibiting certain
                    numerical proportions, and bearing certain obvious relations to each other, and
                    to the locality wherein they are found. These are facts which may be observed
                    and classified, and used as a basis of reasoning, respecting the nature, the
                    uses, and the relative importance of these several objects; but as to the origin
                    of any of these plants, animals or races of men, the facts observed yield no
                    information.</p>
<p>Dr. Hasskarl quotes this text in article IV, "Can the
                    Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots?" Jeremiah 13, 23. The term
                    Cushite, therefore, while it applies in Scripture to the Arabian races, "became
                    also the appellative of a Negro." In this sense it is employed by the prophet
                    Jeremiah. Luther's German translation has Mohrenland, a term equivalent to
                    negroland, or the country of the blacks. Dr. Watts
                    followed this  meaning in the well-known words of one of his hymns:</p>
<p>"As well might Ethiopian slaves<br> Wash out the darkness of their skin,<br>
                    The dead as well may leave their graves<br> As old transgressors case to sin."</p>
<p>Have we a clear history of Africa, other than what the Bible gives? Until the
                    learned, thinking men of African descent interest themselves in writing history
                    and leave something for the coming generations we shall expect antiquated
                    philosophers, and hoary-headed theories to arise in each decade. "What we write
                    remains forever." The ancients have transmitted to us very little knowledge of
                    this great continent of Africa. The discovery of America and the West Indies
                    gave rise to the horrid traffic in Negro slaves. In 1788 a society was formed in
                    London for promoting the exploration of Inner Africa. Under its auspices,
                    important additions were made to the geography of Africa by Houghton, Minigo,
                    Park, Horneman and Burkhardt. In 1831, this association was merged in the Royal
                    Geographical Society. The Dutch settled in South Africa as early as 1650. Thus
                    missionaries have been pioneer of geographical discovery.</p>
<p>Africa, notwithstanding its terrible climate, bad government and petty wars forms
                    one of the most <u>interesting missionary fields in the
                        world</u>. Its native  inhabitants, though deeply degraded,
                    are found peculiarly succeptible to religious influences. And wherever the

                    and has been preached long enough to penetrate through their ignorance and and
                    superstition it has generally found a congenial soul. No mission in in the world
                    has, been more successful, in proportion, to the means employed than those of
                    the Moravians and the London Missionary Society in South Africa and the Church
                    Missionary Society in West Africa. The Roman Catholics sent missionaries there
                    as early as the latter part of the 15th and early part of the 16th centuries.
                    The Baptist, Methodist and Presbyterian, Episcopal and Lutheran churches are
                    famous for their missionary zeal in the dark continent of Africa.</p>
<p>The Scriptures are fuller in their statements even in geography than any other
                    ancient writing which preceded the days of the Greek geographers, who, in
                    comparison with the Old Testament are but modern. They are so accurate as to
                    constitute the best guide book to travellers in the countries in which
                    occurrences of the Scripture took place. "It is not known nor agreed upon what
                    was the original race complexion, or form of either Adam or Noah. Mr. Pickering
                    writes on the subject (on the Races of Men), gives reasons for supposing the
                    African to be the centre and origin of the human family." (See  page
                    305). Again the Ethnological Journal admits that there is not now a pure race of
                    men to be found. Dr. Bachman offers very probable
                    reasons for the opinion that the race of men were intermediate in color and form
                    between the black and the white and that the white are much altered now as the
                    black. "See on the Unity of Human Race, part 2, chapter 1, p.p. 152 164." The
                    primitive races no longer exist. All, or nearly all, the inhabitants of the
                    earth are of mixed blood.-Ethnol. Jour.
                    p. 129. Dr. Mott does indeed struggle hard to show
                    that the word Cush is wrongly translated in our English Bible by the word
                    Ethiopia. And we are willing to admit that the one word is not the etymological
                    equivalent of the other, and that in these modern times the word Ethiopian is
                    not by usage applied to all the descendants of Cush, or Ethiopia to all the
                    countries they inhabit. But it is true, that by ancients Ethiopia was applied to
                    both Asiatic and African nations. They used the term according to its sense of
                    nations "burnt black in the face."</p>
<p>The doctrine of diversity of human races contemplates man as only an animal. That
                    doctrine rests much on a mere assumption of a point questionable at the best. It
                    overlooks the fact that in one important  specific in the full sense
                    in which species are distinguished in lower animals; the varieties of men
                    inter-mingle freely and their offspring are not sterile, as in the case normally
                    among lower animals. That "<u>Pet Theory</u>" overlooks
                    the many weighty points in which as intellectual, speech-using and
                    conscience-possessing beings, capable of indefinite progress and improvement,
                    all the human races presents of resemblance and almost of identity which throw
                    at an unapproachable distance from them all, even the highest orders of the
                    inferior creation, rendering a classification of man on principals adapted to
                    the brutes, inapplicable, inappropriate, and therefore unphilosophical. That
                        "<u>Pet Theory</u>" involves also the disregard of an
                    admitted axiom in philosophy, which <u>forbids</u> the
                    introduction of more causes than are needed to account for the effect, since the
                    known laws of increase will readily admit the population of the globe as now
                    from one original human pair. From all these circumstances naturalists of
                    eminence have rejected, on purely scientific grounds, the doctrine of diversity
                    of races and have maintained the original identity of all the races of men.</p>
<p>Dr. Hasskarl is <u>not
                    alone</u> the <u>ablest</u> advocate of his pet
                    theory, the diversity of races who have utterly failed in <u>all</u> their attempts to reconcile their theory with the teaching of
                    revelation.  They are to compelled to use the word <u>species</u> with at least a modified meaning in their
                    philosophical reasonings; and they are compelled also to put upon several
                    passages of holy writ an interpretation novel, unnatural and as I stated in my
                    last article absolutely untenable.</p>
<p>I therefore hold that the Negro is a part of the Genus Homo and a descendent of
                    Ham. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is
                    neither male or female; for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.-Gal. 3:28.</p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>The thickness of the skull of the Negro indicates neither intellectual
                    inferiority nor structural approximation to the ourang or chimpanzee; in fact,
                    though crania of the various races of mankind may vary, as compared with each
                    other, throughout an almost unlimited series of minor details, they preserve
                    inviolate their great characteristics of distinction; no intermediate condition
                    is discoverable among them, no half human, half simian form, indicative of
                        "<u>Homo Ferus, tetrapus mutus, et hirsutus</u>-the
                    caliban of science-the link which binds man to the arboreal quadrumana." Prof. Owens says, "the  distinction
                    between the skulls of all nations and those of the simial, upon which much of
                    character of the human face depends, and which is not destitute of importance,
                    may here be noticed, namely the elevation, in man of the nasal bones, which form
                    the bridge of the nose; while in the simial the nasal bones (for it is single)
                    lies flat and depressed."</p>
<p>The evidences of a common humanity in all the several races of man,
                    notwithstanding their peculiarities, are so numerous and so unequivocal, that
                    probably the idea of a separate origin never occurred to any of the sacred
                    writers. I would rather take the inspired writers as authority. All who take the
                    Mosaic account of the creation, the Deluge, the confusion of tongues at Babel,
                    and the subsequent dispersion of the descendents of Noah over the face of all
                    the earth, will find no common sense in what Dr.
                    Hasskarl has written. The sacred writers were intent upon conveying truth of
                    deep import to the higher nature of man, as a moral agent as fallen and
                    degraded, but yet capable of recovery. Before these high interests the
                    differences of complexion, of feature, of figure, and of conformation, of
                    language, of habits, of relation to other races and ethnological status sink
                    into insignificance. "Since the deep researches of modern philosophers in
                    natural history, assisted  by the extensive discoveries of modern
                    navigators, through the great enlargement of our acquaintance with the face of
                    our globe, have opened so many sources of wonder, without affording any adequate
                    means to arrive at the causes of the phenomena new objections have been made to
                    the Mosaic history of the first ages of the world, which, it has been urged,
                    must have been intended to relate, not to the whole world, but to those parts
                    with which the Jewish people had no immediate concern. Many former, and
                    insuperable as the difficulties occurring in that concise historical sketch may
                    be, some arising from extreme antiquity of idiom, some, perhaps, from injury
                    received in multifarious translations, and others from that allegorical style,
                    always familiar and always in esteem in the East, invention still has never been
                    able to form any theory equally consistent with the principles of the most
                    enlightened philosophy, or equally consonant to the most authentic testimonies
                    remaining from remotest ages, whether transmitted by human memory or borne in
                    the face of nature." The sacred penmen were men of God and these men of God deal
                    with man as man wherever found and under whatever clime or circumstance. It
                    little behooves a christian minister in these enlightened days, to revive such
                    antiquated theory as Dr. Hasskarl  is
                    endeavoring to do. The idea of presenting <u>his two
                    books</u> to us as authority. Any crank can write a book. Truth is the
                    highest authority. Is the Negro a subject of the Church or State? asks Mr.
                    Hasskarl. Both of these questions were answered before he was born.</p>
<p>(A.) The Church in all ages has said "Come unto me all yea that labor and are
                    heavy laden and I will give you rest." Church councils, synods, confessions and
                    creeds have recognized man as man wherever found whether bond or free. The
                    "Ecclesia" founded by Jesus Christ has always stood for truth, freedom and
                    manhood. It is only in a distorted will and a perverted conscience that the
                    light of truth has been obscured. The church as a divine institution has never
                    dealt with the Negro as a subject of Ethnology but as a man. The Deists and all
                    the various schools of theologians have never made the subject a part of their
                    theology. The Negro is not a subject of the church as a Negro but as a part of
                    the human family a brother "though carved in ebony."</p>
<p>(B.) Is the Negro the subject of State? asked Dr.
                    Hasskarl. I answer in the negative. There was a time when he was a subject of
                    the State. He was held as a slave. You remember the struggle between the North
                    and South in regard to slavery. The <u>civil war was not
                        fought to free Negroes</u>. But  rather to preserve the Union
                    and if the Union could have been preserved without emancipating the Negro we
                    would still be in chains and sold from the auction block. God who rules the
                    destiny of men as well as of things, put it into the hearts of the President of
                    the United States and a part of his cabinet and others "to let my people go."
                    Too much praise can never be given to the great Abolitionists of bygone days for
                    agitating and making sentiment that caused the Negro as a slave to become a man.
                    According to the rights invested by the amendments to the Constitution of this
                    country the Negro is not a subject of the State. There is in this country to-day
                    over (9,000,000) nine million descendants of Ham, owning ($400,000,000) four
                    hundred million dollars of property free of all incumbrances.</p>
<p>There is no class of people quicker to recognize manhood in the Negro than the
                    white people of this country. All honors to them for their philanthrophy. We
                    have men in the diplomatic service, in congress, legislature, council chambers,
                    register of the treasury, collector of ports and post-masters and in fact in
                    nearly every department of government service. Editors, college presidents,
                    lawyers, teachers, preachers and bishops. What greater evidences of humanity and
                    intellectual accomplishments can be found in any nation within  the
                    same time and bounded by the same environments.</p>
<p>There are Negroes whose names are already written on the pages of history, while
                        Rev. Hasskarl is comparatively unknown and is
                    obliged to place his own biography at the head of <u>each</u> little pamphlet he writes to let us know he lives. The best
                    biographies are usually the shortest. Is the Negro a subject of the State? <u>Sounds ancient</u>.</p>
<p>(C) The Negro has <u>no</u> history. Dr. Haaskarl you are mistaken again. He has a history both ancient
                    and modern. It is a glorious one at that, but men of your opinions try to rob
                    him of it, by begging the question and make it appear that the historians are
                    talking of some other fellow. Negroes are abundantly represented in the
                    pictorial delineations of the Egyptian monuments of every epoch, some of them
                    are nearly 3500 years old, and as if to enforce the distinction of race, are
                    placed side by side with people of the poorest Caucasian features. The
                    delineations of negro feature supposed to be the most ancient, have not yet been
                    identified with the epoch to which they belong." E A. in a tomb at Thebes, the
                    age of Amontuonch an unplaced king, supposed to be before the 16th dynasty and
                    consequently more than B C. 2000. See also in the procession of the age of
                    Thothmes 4 at Thebes, Negroes bear tribute about B.C. 1700.  At
                    Thebes (in a catacomb). Amunoph 3 receives homage from "black chiefs of Cash in
                    Ethiopia." Negroes are found abundantly on the monuments of Horus, Rameses II,
                    of the 19th dynasty and Rameses III in Egypt and Nubia. In Philadelphia at
                    Fairmount Park you may see a monument found at Belt Oalli, in Nubia, where
                    Runses II makes war on Negroes. The great history we have and the great
                    antiquity of the Negro race admits no question and has even led some
                    [philosophers?] to surmise that it was <u>the primitive
                        stock of mankind</u>." The question is where did the white man come from?
                    It has has been proven that the Negro existed 3467 years ago.</p>
<p>The Negro has a history and you cannot rob him of it. One of the reasons why
                    Africa is not more enlightened to-day is that some of the missionaries used the
                    poor ignorant people for their personal gain and traded whiskey and rum instead
                    of the giving the bread of life. I understand that the object of the series of
                    articles is to create sentiment in the Luther in church against supporting the
                    missionary work in Africa. I am quite sure that the wise and conservative men of
                    the Lutheran church do not indorse such a wild cat scheme. Rev. Hasskarl's argument from begining to end is
                    simply called from the well-known works of Noth and Agassiz.</p>
<p>The theory of a plurality of species and of origin in the present races of men
                         we regard as unphilosophical, and contrary to right reason. It
                    is unphilosophical, because it builds a towering conclusion upon a narrow and
                    insufficient foundation. The data necessary to form a <u>just</u> and proper conclusion are yet few and partial. Even as it
                    regards human skulls and bones, all the collections as yet made are very
                    defective, while the osteology and physiology of the various races of animals
                    has received scarcely any attention. To deduce a general and positive
                    conclusion, therefore from such data, is altogether premature and unwarrantable.
                    Equally unphilosophical and narrow is it to draw a conclusion as to specific
                    difference from varieties in man, as if he were the only animal in nature, and
                    to determine that difference which are found every day in the same acknowledged
                    species of other animals must be regarded as proofs of a different species among
                    men. We shall take the word of God as our guide and feel perfectly safe. From
                    Ethnological, Philological, Exegetical research I am forced to conclude that the
                    Negro is a (1) human being, (2) he has a soul, (3) he is made of same blood as
                    other men, (4) he is not subject of church or state, (5) he is capable of the
                    highest intellectual development, (6) he is a part of the great Hametic race, a
                    descendant of Adam by the line of Noah.</p>
