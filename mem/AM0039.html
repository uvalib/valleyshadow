                            B. Berkeley, 1904</h3>
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> Vignette concerning a disagreement between Stonewall Jackson and a subordinate
                    over the placement of an artillery battery.</p>
<p>Capt. Frank B. Berkeley, of Staunton, Va., tells the following, which he had from his
                    brother, Dr.Cater
                    Berkeley, who was present as an officer of the battery in question and heard the
                    conversation:</p>
<p>"During the battle of Malvern Hill Gen. Whiting,
                    whose division had been temporarily assigned to Jackson's command, had put his
                    troops in position on each side of a road that led directly to the Federal
                    lines. In that road he had placed the Staunton Artillery, at that time commanded
                    by Capt. Balthis, as part of his line of battle.
                        Gen. Jackson came riding up and, halting, said:
                        "Gen. Whiting, what's this battery doing here?
                    Take it up on that hill," pointing toward the enemy. Whiting replied: "That hill
                    is occupied by a Federal battery." Gen. Jackson
                    answered: "Gen. Whiting, will you obey orders?" He
                    answered, "I will, sir, but under protest," and, turnign to the battery, he
                    said: "Captain, take your battery up on that hill at a gallop." The guns were
                    promptly limbered up and the battery moved forward as ordered. Seeing this
                    movement, the Federal battery as promptly limbered up and left its position,
                    which was at once occupied by the Confederate battery, which soon opened on the
                    enemy."</p>
