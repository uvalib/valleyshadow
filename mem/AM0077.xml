                <p>LEE'S HIGH ESTIMATE OF GENERAL IMBODEN.</p>
                <p>[The death of General Imboden in 1895 brought out this editorial tribute in a
                    paper of Staunton, <abbr expan="Virginia">Va.</abbr>, his home town. It was sent
                    to the VETERAN by H. T. Shank, of North River, <abbr expan="Virginia"
                    >Va.</abbr>, who served in McClanahan's Battery of Horse Artillery under Imboden
                    and fired the first shot in the capture of Charlestown, <abbr
                        expan="West Virginia">W. Va.</abbr> He was also in all the movements
                    referred to in this tribute.]</p>
                <p>In the flight of thirty years, this generation has lost much of the distinguished
                    service rendered by Brigadier General John D. Imboden to the Army of Northern
                    Virginia. He was a born fighter, and his movements on the field were marked by
                    the ability of an experienced commander, though their author was reared to the
                    pursuits of a civilian. There were few officers in that army to whom General Lee
                    trusted more critical duties or to whom and of whom he more frequently expressed
                    his approval. His recent death recalls those deeds, and the fact that he was an
                    Augusta County man and that a large body of the men who so gallantly served
                    under him were from our county, makes it a pleasant duty to recall that
                    approval. The following two letters, which we take from the Confederate Records,
                    are instances of it:</p>
                <p>"HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN <abbr expan="VIRGINIA">VA.</abbr>,<lb/> October
                    23, 1863.</p>
                <p>"<hi rend="underline"><abbr expan="Brigadier General">Brig. Gen.</abbr> J. D.
                        Imboden, Commanding, Etc.-General:</hi> Your letter of the 19th <abbr
                        expan="instant">inst.</abbr>, reporting the capture of the enemy's force at
                    Charlestown, has been received. The movement was well conceived and executed in
                    a manner that reflects great credit upon yourself and the officers and men of
                    your command, to whom I desire to express my appreciation of the brave and
                    valuable service they have rendered. Very respectfully,</p>
                <p>"Your obedient servant, R. E. LEE, <hi rend="underline">General</hi>."</p>
                <p>"HEADQUARTERS ARMY of NORTHERN <abbr expan="VIRGINIA">VA.</abbr>,<lb/> October
                    23, 1863.</p>
                <p>"<hi rend="underline"><abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> S. Cooper, Adjutant and
                        Inspector-General, Richmond, <abbr expan="Virginia">Va.</abbr></hi>,</p>
                <p>"When the movement of the army from the Rapidan commenced, General Imboden was
                    instructed to advance down the Valley and guard the gaps of the mountains on our
                    left. This duty was well performed by that officer and on the 18th <abbr
                        expan="instant">inst.</abbr>, he marched upon Charlestown and succeeded, by
                    a well concerted plan, in surrounding all their stores and transportation. Only
                    a few escaped to Harper's Ferry. The enemy advanced from that place in superior
                    numbers to attack General Imboden, who retired, bringing off his prisoners and
                    captured property, his command suffering very little loss and inflicting some
                    damage upon the pursuing columns.</p>
                <p>"In the course of the operations 2,436 prisoners were captured, including 41
                    commissioned officers. Of the above number, 434 were taken by General Imboden.</p>
                <p>"A more complete account, with a statement of our loss in killed, wounded, and
                    prisoners, will be forwarded as soon as the necessary official reports shall
                    have been received.</p>
                <p>"Very respectfully, your obedient servant,<lb/> "R. E. LEE, <hi
                        rend="underline">General</hi>."</p>
                <p>But perhaps no higher tribute was paid to General Imboden's courage and skill
                    than that involved in the fact that after the disaster at Gettysburg, General
                    Lee assigned him an important part in protecting the Confederate rear on the
                    retreat of the army into Virginia. The following is an extract from General
                    Lee's official report, showing how that trust was executed:</p>
                <pb n="421"/>
                <p>"HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN <abbr expan="VIRGINIA">VA.</abbr>,<lb/> July 31,
                    1863.</p>
                <p>"<hi rend="underline"><abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> S. Cooper, Adjutant and
                        Inspector General, Richmond, <abbr expan="Virginia">Va.</abbr>:</hi></p>
                <p>"General Imboden, in pursuance of the instructions previously referred to, had
                    been actively engaged on the left of General Ewell during the progress of the
                    latter into Maryland. He had driven off the forces guarding the Baltimore and
                    Ohio Railroad, destroying all the important bridges on that route from
                    Cumberland to Martinsburg, and seriously damaged the Chesapeake and Ohio canal.
                    He subsequently took position at Hancock, and, after the arrival of Longstreet
                    and Hill at Chambersburg, was directed to march by way of McConnellsburg to that
                    place.</p>
                <p>"Part of our train moved by the road through Fairfield, and the rest by way of
                    Cashtown, guarded by General Imboden. In passing through the mountains in
                    advance of the column, the great length of the trains exposed them to attack by
                    the enemy's cavalry, which captured a number of wagons and ambulances, but they
                    succeeded in reaching Williamsport without serious loss.</p>
                <p>"They were attacked at that place on the 6th by the enemy's cavalry, which was
                    gallantly repulsed by General Imboden. The attacking force was subsequently
                    encountered and driven off by General Stuart and pursued for several miles in
                    the direction of Boonsborough."</p>
                <p>Those who are familiar with the history of General Imboden's command during the
                    long years of the war can safely say that the work it did so well could have
                    been <orig reg="entrusted">intrusted</orig> to no braver men and no better
                    commander.</p>
