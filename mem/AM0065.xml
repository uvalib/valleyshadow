                <p>M. L. Leonard recalls the sneaky capture of Yankee troops by E. G. Fishburne and
                    W. D. McCausland in Augusta County.</p>

            <div1 type="article" id="d5">
                <p>On the night of August 30, 1862, after the second battle of Manassas, Company E,
                    of the 1st Virginia Cavalry, was ordered to advance and establish a picket line.
                    Captain McClung sent <abbr expan="Sargeant">Sergt.</abbr> E. G. Fishburne, with
                    W. D. McCausland and Henry Kennedy, on a road leading across the country and
                    connecting with the "Little River Turnpike" to take a position and wait for
                    further orders from him. Shortly after Fishburne had selected his position a
                    body of horsemen approached them from the direction of the enemy. Thinking that
                    probably it was Captain McClung returning from the front with the remainder of
                    the company after completing the picket line, the detail allowed them to advance
                    to within one hundred yards before calling themm to a halt. Fishburne demanded
                    what regiment they belonged to, and received the answer, "--New York," and in
                    return was asked "Who are you?" Fishburne replied, "4th Pennsylvania," and at
                    once consulted with his two comrades how they could manage to capture the New
                    Yorkers. he then asked the captain to send his orderly sergeant forward. When
                    the orderly rode up, they disarmed him and sent Kennedy back with him,
                    instructing Kennedy to take him to the first camp he could find and ask the
                    commander of the camp to send him a squad of men to aid in the capture of the
                    Yankees that he was detaining.</p>
                <p>The Yankee captian, becoming impatient at the delay, inquired why he could not
                    come on with his command. Wishing to consume as much time as possible and
                    expecting reenforcements as soon as Kennedy could reach some camp, Fishburne
                    evaded the captain's question as long as possible, and then requested him to
                    ride up to where he (Fishburne) was, that they might consult over the matter
                    more fully and come to some understanding. This the captain agreed to; and when
                    he rode up, Fishburne put the drop on him and told him that if he gave the alarm
                    to his men he would be a dead man. He then placed the captain between McCausland
                    and himself, facing the rear, and ordered him to command his scompany forward.
                    The captian answered, "I am your prisoner and cannot do that," adding, "I
                    suspected something was wrong."</p>
                <p>Fishburne then gave the command himself, "Forward! Trot! March !" and started for
                    the rear with one prisoner and forty-two armed men following, intending to keep
                    the space of one hundred yards between them intact; but the men riding in the
                    rear soon closed up the space between them.&gt; When they had marched thus
                    for about one mile, they saw and recognized the dead body of Kennedy lying in
                    the road, and realized that there was no hope of meeting reenforcements. At this
                    point of the march to the rear a suspicion was aroused among their armed
                    prisoners (for these men were no disarmed until camp was reached) when one of
                    them said in a loud tone to his comrades: "Boys, I'll be d-- if I don't believe
                    these fellows are Rebels. Didn't you see that dead man lying back there in the
                    road?" He evidently thought they were nearing the battlefiedl they had so
                    hastily left a few hours before.</p>
                <p>McCausland says that wne he heard this chat going on among the armed men then
                    trotting along in the rear he drew the rein a little tighter on his horse and
                    gradually guided him to the left, so as to place himself on the flank and near
                    the rear of the column, thinking Fishburne and himself were soon to meet the
                    fate of Kenney, and he wanted to be in position to do some shooting himself
                    while the fun lasted. After marching a few miles farther, they came in sight of
                    a regiment of cavalry in camp and marched direct to it, when Fishburne repeated
                    his second order to "Halt and surrender," and McCausland from the rear repeated
                    the order to surrender.</p>
                <p>This regiment was the 12th Virginia Cavalry, commanded by <abbr expan="Colonel"
                        >Col.</abbr> Asher W. Harmna, and to them were turned over the captain and
                    forty-two armed men. Then, and then only, was there any confusion in this whole
                    affair. The surprise was so great to these men in camp that they at once secured
                    their arms, and Fishburne had to dismount as quickly as possible and run among
                    the men and explain to keep from being fired upon. Fishburne and McCausland at
                    once arranged to have the body of Kennedy brought into camp, and upon
                    examination it was found that he had been murdered by his prisoner by a stab in
                    the heart with a knife, which had been overlooked in the hasty search of the
                    prisoner whne captured. Kennedy's body was sent home to his parents, and now
                    lies in the old cemetery near Crimor, Augusta County, <abbr expan="Virginia"
                    >Va</abbr>.</p>
                <p>McCausland, so far as known, is still living (?) somewhere in Texas. Whether
                    living or dead, no two braver soldiers ever served in the Confederate army.</p>
                <p>The account of this capture is as near Fishburne's and McCausland's own language
                    as I can give it, and I believe correct, as I have gone over the matter with
                    Fishburne several times since the war, and also with McCausland, and as a
                    comrade in the same company was familiar with the details at the time as
                    recounted by those who made the capture.</p>
                <p>The number of the New York regiment in question, I think, was the 47th, but I am
                    not certain. At the time we had the captain's name, also the orderly sergeant
                    who murdered Kennedy. The boys kept a sharp lookout for him ever afterwards
                    among all prisoners captured, and I believe if they could have gotten their
                    hands on him they certainly would have courtmartialed him on the spot.</p>
