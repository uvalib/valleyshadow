                <p>In her letter, Dahlgren shows that she relishes the fact that Ulrich Dahlgren is
                    despised by Confederates/Confederate sympathizers. She considers Dahlgren a

                <p>The Historic Dispatch<lb/> James C. Morehead's Story</p>
                <p>In the afternoon of July 1, 1863, I was standing near the bridge at Funkstown,
                        <abbr expan="Maryland">Md.</abbr>, in company with Tom Cunningham, when
                        <abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Dahlgren with his squad came by. Tom said
                    I'll bet $5.00 they are union men. The Captain <orig reg="overheard">over
                    heard</orig> the remark, and said "How can you tell union men from rebels. Tom
                    replied we are union soldiers and ought to know. The Captain then asked for
                    information of the rebel soldiers. I told him it was safe for him to go into
                    Hagerstown he asked if we lived here. I replied I live her at present, but my
                    home is in Greencastle, <abbr expan="Pennsylvania">Pa.</abbr><abbr
                        expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Dahlgren then said "Greencastle" I replied "yes
                    sir." he said how would you like to go with me as a guide to Greencastle. I
                    replied that I would go, and see my family and if they were satisfied I would
                    go. "He waited on the public square in Hagerstown until I returned, when he
                    ordered me to take a gray horse, that was <orig reg="ridden">ridde</orig> by a
                    boy in the rear of the soldiers I then guided <abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr>
                    Dahlgren along by roads to the State Line and from there to <abbr
                        expan="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Isaac Shanks where we all got supper and fed
                    our horses. The party consisted of Capt. Dahlgren, sergeant of Kline and nine
                    other enlisted soldiers, two volunteers and four scouts and one guide. We
                    reached John Detrich's woods in the evening were we camped all night. Next
                    morning by daylight I came to Greencastle to find out what I could of the
                    citizens of the town, as to the movements of the Confederate forces. I then
                    returned to our camp in the woods, <abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Dahlgren
                    then ordered his soldiers to saddle their horses andd we all came into
                    Greencastle together. We balted in front of the Antrim House. Several of us went
                    out scouting. I saw a squad of Confederates approaching town from the South, I
                    knew there must be something important, the way they marched. I so reported to
                        <abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Dahlgren and he placed his soldiers in
                    the Southeast corner of the Public Square and when the rebel squad was in front
                    of J. Yous' store <abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Dahlgren ordered his men to
                    left half, wheel, draw their sabres and fly at the rebels, with their horses on
                    the full run, <abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Dahlgren rode up to the rebels
                    and ordered them to surrender, which they all did twenty-two soldiers and two
                    mounted mail carriers. The rebel mail was in two ordinary mail sacks, and was
                    opened by the soldiers. In the mail was found the dispatch, from Jeff Davis to
                    General Lee, and which Captain Dahlgren carried to Gettysburg. I went with the
                    soldiers having the prisoners in charge to Enmitsburg <abbr expan="Maryland"
                    >Md.</abbr>, where we turned the prisoners over to the proper officers and I
                    continued scouting for the United States forces for a long time afterwards in
                    Maryland and Virginia.<lb/> James C. Moorhead</p>
                <p>Abraham Hupert's Story</p>
                <p>I was standing in front of Jacob Hostetter's store, which was then in the room
                    now occupied by P. F. Carl, in the morning of July 2, 1863. I looked at the
                    capture of the Rebel mail. The Confederate party went in front of the property
                    of Johua Yous, where <abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Dahlgren made his attack
                    I saw the soldiers sitting on their horses in the <orig reg="southeast">south
                        east</orig> corner of the square. The horses heads were toward G. W.
                    Zeigler's property. I saw them wheel and attack the Confederate party they did
                    not fire a shot, but some shots were fired by some rebel soldiers, who were in
                    the rear. Two bullets from the firing struck the Carl house, now occupied by
                    John Carl's family, the bullets struck near the gable window and the marks are
                    to be seen to this day. The back building had not been erected, and the Carl
                    house was exposed from that side. I saw the Union soldiers bring the captured
                    rebels and mail bags into the corner of the square near where Mr. Glass lives. I
                    saw the Union soldiers cut the mail bags open and pour the letters out onto the
                    pavement in front of Kreps and Prather store and I was informed that the
                    celebrated dispatch was found among the mail then and there captured.</p>
                <p>Story of a Prominent Merchant</p>
                <p>"After captain Dahlgren arrested the mail carriers, one of them objected to being
                    searched, but the Captain order it promptly to be done, and in a sort of valise
                    tied behind his saddle were found two shirts, on the inside of one of those
                    shirts was found the dispatch which <abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Dahlgren
                    carried to General Meade at Gettysburg and which Colonel Rayall says turned the
                    tide of battle.</p>
                <p>The fighting qualities of Captain Dahlgren were so well established <pb n="5"/>
                    by his <orig reg="intrepidity">interpidity</orig> here exhibited that it is
                    plain to the reader, that, had he been given a sufficient force, the Brigade for
                    which he pleaded General Lee would have lost his entire wagon train, which
                    contained the stores of <orig reg="rifles">riffles</orig> and common <orig
                        reg="ammunition">amunition</orig>, for his entire army and the supply of
                    food for his fighting men. The infliction of that loss, with the swollen Potomac
                    river in his front, General Meades victorious army passing his rear end ranks,
                    but one corner would have been left open-unconditional surrender;</p>
                <p>Following this line of thought, the reader in imagination can see the long lines
                    of men, the flower of our lands whose precious lives would have been spared, the
                    thousands of homes, that would have been saved from desolation; the rivers of
                    blood that afterward flowed, that would have been prevented, the millions and
                    millions and millions of treasure, that would have been saved had this gallant
                    young soldier's advice and <orig reg="consent">concent</orig> been followed.
                    Perhaps however, this <orig reg="nation's">nations'</orig> purification was not
                    yet complete. The law of <orig reg="Atonement">Atonment</orig> not then
                    fulfilled, and that present destiny, which shapes all our ends, was then
                    preparing for immortality. the gifted and gallant-soul of Ulric Dahlgren<lb/>

                <p>As the widow of Ulric Dahlgren's father Admiral Dahlgren, I thank you, and
