                <p><abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> George W. Imboden, noted lawyer, soldier, and
                    public citizen, departed this life from his home at Ansted, Fayette County,
                        <abbr expan="West Virginia">W. Va.</abbr>, on January 8, 1922, in the
                    eighty-seventh year of his life.</p>
                <p>He was born in Augusta County, <abbr expan="Virginia">Va.</abbr>, and practiced
                    law at Staunton till the breaking out of the War between the States, when in
                    April, 1861, he enlisted and was elected first sergeant of the Staunton
                    Artillery, and second lieutenant in November. On its reorganization, he was
                    chosen major of the 62nd Virginia Infantry, and in December, 1862, was elected
                    colonel of the 18th Virginia Cavalry, with which he served till the close of the
                    war.</p>
                <p>He and his four brothers-<abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> John D. Imboden, <abbr
                        expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> F. M. Imboden Capt. J. P. Imboden, and <abbr
                        expan="Major">Maj.</abbr> James A. Imboden-all gained distinction for
                    bravery in the Confederate service, and all continued in service till the
                    surrender of General Lee.</p>
                <p>Colonel Imboden was a gallant soldier, leading in many battles in a quiet way and
                    with sound judgment. He kept his own counsels and often sprung surprises on the
                    enemy. At one time he captured a wagon train of fifty-four mule teams, newly
                    equipped and loaded with provisions and corn. When the front wagon was upset and
                    caused a stampede, he ordered all to turn, and at Summersville they ran an old
                    grist mill all night and had a royal feast in the morning. In June, 1863, he
                    surprised and entered Cumberland, <abbr expan="Maryland">Md.</abbr> Through his
                    noble example of faithfulness, courage, and self-sacrifice he won the respect
                    and confidence of his followers, and with honor and humanity he was always kind
                    to his captured prisoners. He was wounded at Gordonsville in December, 1864, had
                    his jaw broken and was shot in the shoulder. He ever had the confidence of
                    Generals Lee and Stonewall Jackson, who could safely rely on him to carry out
                    the plans <orig reg="entrusted">intrusted</orig> to him.</p>
                <p>In December, 1869, Colonel Imboden married Miss Mary Frances Tyree, of Fayette
                    County, <abbr expan="Virginia">Va.</abbr>, and removed to Crittenden, <abbr
                        expan="Kentucky">Ky.</abbr>, but in 1870 he came to Fayette County, <abbr
                        expan="West Virginia">W. Va.</abbr>, and engaged with the Ganley Coal
                    Company till 1878 as their attorney, also practicing law at the Fayette County
                    bar. He was elected to the legislature when the capital was at Wheeling, was
                    president of the county court for four years, mayor of Ansted, recorder, and was
                    also connected with the Ansted National Bank as president or director from is
                    beginning in 1907.</p>
                <p>Several years after the death of his first wife, in December, 1889, he married
                    Miss Angia Mildred, daughter of <abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Hudson M.
                    Dickinson, one of the pioneers of the county and a prominent citizen, with whom
                    he lived in happy companionship for thirty-two years in their home,
                    "Contentment," at Ansted, and who is left to mourn her loss. Politically,
                    Colonel Imboden was a <orig reg="staunch">stanch</orig> Democrat and a great
                    admirer of Woodrow Wilson and his administration. He was always interested in
                    the development of his State, his county, and especially his own home town,
                    Ansted, where he lived fifty-one years. He was a student, well posted in ancient
                    and modern history, a subscriber to the CONFEDERATE VETERAN, which he always
                    read with great interest. He was a member of the Jeb Stuart Camp, <abbr
                        expan="United Confederate Veterans">U. C. V.</abbr> and Commander of the
                    Camp from 1913 until failing health caused <orig reg="his">him</orig>
                    resignation. In faith he was a Presbyterian, and in early life gave his heart to
                    God and became occupied in Church work. He was elected a ruling elder in 1867
                    and served faithfully in his duties in Kentucky and in Virginia. He was a Sunday
                    school superintendent for forty-seven years. He was not a sectarian, loved all
                    of God's children and joined heartily with them in advancing the kingdom.</p>
                <p>At his funeral ministers of the Presbyterian, Methodist Episcopal Church, South,
                    and Baptist lovingly joined in paying tribute to his memory, after which he was
                    laid to rest, dressed in his Confederate gray, in a gray casket, at the Ansted
                    Cemetery, near the tomb where lie the remains of the sainted mother of Stonewall
                    Jackson.</p>
                <p>Soldier of God, well done,<lb/> Rest from thy loved employ,<lb/> The battle
                    fought, thy victory won,<lb/> Enter thy Master's joy.</p>
