                            Unknown, September 13, 1870</h3>
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> This collection of rhetorical questions seems to be an indictment of the
                    Democratic part's potency after the Civil War.</p>
<p>What has become of the Democratic war cries of ten years ago? Is slavery still a
                    divine institution? Does the constitution as it was, or as the Domocracy would make it, carry slavery into the
                    territories of the union? Should capital own its labor? Is it right and proper
                    that abolitionists should be exterminated at any risk, or by any means? Is it
                    constitutional for a nation to fight for its own preservation? Can the South
                    ever be conquered? Should not our wayward sisters depart in peace? Ought we not
                    to have these issues discussed before the people by our Democratic journals and
                    orators? Why, of course not, these are dead issues say our friends. Well then
                    what becomes of the party that risked its political life on them? If it is not
                    dead it ought to be.</p>
