                <p>Hot Spings, Va., 23d August, 1870.</p>
                <p>My Dear Mr. Corcoran-It has been a source of regret to me this summer that I have
                    been unable to enjoy your company while you were in the mountains. As you have
                    left the <hi rend="underline">White</hi>, I presume <pb n="155"/> your visit
                    to Virginia for this season is near its close and I see no prospect of my
                    meeting with you. I hope that you have been benefited by your visit to the
                    mountains and will return to your home refreshed and strengthened. My best
                    wishes accompany you wherever you are. I have been trying the effects of these
                    waters, by the advice of <abbr expan="Doctor">Dr.</abbr> Buckler, and cannot now
                    perceive much change in my rheumatic symptoms, though I will only have been here
                    a fortnight <orig reg="tomorrow">to-morrow</orig>. I purpose leaving here Monday
                    next, 29th, for Staunton, for the purpose of attending a meeting of the
                    stockholders of the Valley Railroad Company. They have been disappointed in
                    obtaining from the county of Augusta its subscription to the road, and have to
                    devise ways and means of making up its quota of $300,000 before they can receive
                    the benefit of the subscription of the city of Baltimore and of the Baltimore
                    and Ohio Railroad Company. They have an impression that, as president of the
                    company, I can assist them, and I have been so strongly urged on the subject,
                    that, if elected, I will accept and serve them as well as I can. I do not think
                    they ought, however to put me on these "forlorn hope" expeditions. I have served
                    my turn.</p>
                <p>I have watched, with much anxiety, the progress of the war between France and
                    Germany, and without going into the merits of the question at issue, or
                    understanding the necessity of the recourse to arms, I have regretted that they
                    did not submit their differences to the arbitration of the other Powers, as
                    provided in the articles of the treaty of Paris of 1856. It would have been a
                    grand moral victory over the passions of men, and would have so elevated the
                    contestants in the eyes of the present and future generations as to have
                    produced a beneficial effect. It might have been expecting, however, too much
                    from the present standard of civilization, and I fear we are destined to kill
                    and slaughter each other for ages to come. You have, in addition, personal
                    anxieties in the result, and the natural feeling lest your children should be
                    mixed up in its complication. As far as I can read the accounts, the French have
                    met with serious reverses, which seem to have demoralized the nation and are
                    therefore alarming. Whatever may be the issue, I cannot help sympathizing with
                    the struggles of a warlike people to drive invaders from their land.</p>
                <p>Wishing you all health and every happiness,</p>
                <p>I am, most truly and sincerely, yours,</p>
                <p>R. E. Lee.</p>
                <p>Mr. W. W. Corcoran.</p>
