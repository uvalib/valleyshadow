                            1876</h3>
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> A favorable review of a book, "Chancellorsville," by Jed. Hotchkiss and William
                    Allan.</p>
<p>From Colonel Wm. Allan, formerly chief of ordinance Second Corps Army Northern
                    Virginia, we have received "CHANCELLORSVILLE," by Major Jed. Hotchkiss and
                    Colonel Wm. Allan. This is a very able and valuable contribution to the history
                    of the Virginia battle fields. The narrative is clear, accurate and vigorous,
                    and the maps are in every respect admirable. The book is gotten up in the best
                    style of <u>D. Van Nostrand</u>, New York, and should
                    have a place in the library of every military student.</p>
