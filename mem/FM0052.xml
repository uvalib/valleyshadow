                <p>Attack on "Radical" politicians who denounce Union veterans for their attachment
                    to the Democratic party..</p>
            </div1>

            <div1 type="article" id="d5">
                <p>Already a gallant soldier has been subjected to the vilest abuse, on the part of
                    the Radical press, for the simple reason that he has been nominated by a
                    Democratic convention for a State office. Before the State convention met,
                    General <abbr expan="McCandless">M'Candless</abbr> was, in the estimation of
                    everybody, a character to be admired for his patriotism and heroism during the
                    war. He received a large share of the praise awarded to that body of gallant
                    soldiers which is the pride of the people of the Keystone State, the
                    Pennsylvania Reserve Corps. Indeed such was the estimate put upon his services
                    by his companions in arms that the honored him with the position of President of
                    their Association. But no matter how exalted a man's patriotism may have been,
                    no matter what sacrifices he may have made for the Union, no matter what heroism
                    he may have displayed on the battle-field, no matter how many wounds he may have
                    received in defense of his country, if he accepts a Democratic nomination for
                    the most unimportant position, the arrows of detraction are aimed at him at
                    once, and there is no lie too mean for Radicalism to coin against him. So it is
                    with General <abbr expan="McCandless">M'Candless</abbr>. Imputations are made
                    upon his patriotism, doubts are entertained as to his courage, and everything
                    base that political malignity can concoct, is put into circulation so as to
                    bring him into disrepute and induce those who would have honored him for his
                    patriotism and heroism to refuse him their support at the polls. Such tricks in
                    politics are so low that every honorable man must despise them.</p>
                <p>One of those falsehoods which the Radicals are attempting to deceive the people
                    with is the allegation that General <abbr expan="McCandless">M'Candless</abbr>
                    resigned his position in the army before the expiration of his term of service
                    because he faltered in his devotion to the Union. This statement has taken the
                    round of the Radical journals of the State, although every Radical editor knew
                    it to be false. General <abbr expan="McCandless">M'Candless</abbr> served the
                    entire term to which the Reserve Corps was mustered into service, and every day
                    that they were held after the expiration of their term of service. Radical
                    editors who never shouldered a musket for an hour in the war for the Union,
                    denounce General <abbr expan="McCandless">M'Candless</abbr> because he did not
                    re-enlist after the Reserve Corps was mustered out. It seems to us that the man
                    who contemplates for a moment the bloody engagements in which the Reserves took
                    such a conspicuous part, who reads the names of the numerous battles upon their
                    bullet-ridden flags, and who turns to the sad history of the many brave men who
                    fell from their ranks into the cold embrace of death, ought to be satisfied that
                    the soldiers of that band of brave men contributed, in their original term of
                    service, their full share towards the preservation of the Union and the
                    maintenance of the National honor.</p>
                <p>Radicals of Franklin county, the term of service that <abbr expan="Colonel"
                    >Col.</abbr> Wm. D. Dixon, of St. Thomas, served, General <abbr
                        expan="McCandless">M'Candless</abbr> served. Every day of the time that
                    Lieutenant Wm. Burgess, of Louden, gave to the cause of the Union, General <abbr
                        expan="McCandless">M'Candless</abbr> gave. Every hour that Captain Joe
                    Davison, of Greencastle, devoted to the crushing of the rebellion, General <abbr
                        expan="McCandless">M'Candless</abbr> devoted. For every minute that <abbr
                        expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> John L. Ritchie, of
                    <unclear>Martinsburg</unclear>, faced the rebels on Southern soil, General <abbr
                        expan="McCandless">M'Candless</abbr> can count like minute also. Captain
                    John H. Walker, of <unclear>Fa----nsburg</unclear>, can boast no longer period
                    of service than General <abbr expan="McCandless">M'Candless</abbr>. Assistant
                        <unclear>A----</unclear> Thomas J. Grimsson stood as a mark for rebel
                    bullets no longer than did General <abbr expan="McCandless">M'Candless</abbr>.
                    Thaddeus M. Mahon, Esq., the defeated and renominated candidate of the Radicals
                    for Assembly, can boast no greater service to his country. Colonel James G.
                    Elder, <abbr expan="The Honorable">Hon.</abbr> D. W. Howe, High Sheriff J. W.
                    Fistcher, E. Wilson Hays, Esq., Postmaster John A. Selders, Jere. Cook, Esq.,
                    Editor of the Repository, and Adjutant John Stewart must lay their nine months
                    alongside of General M'Candless' three years and upwards. All these are soldiers
                    who vote the Radical ticket. The record of no one of them outshines that of
                    General <abbr expan="McCandless">M'Candless</abbr>. Is it not time that the
                    tongue of calumny shall come to wag? If the gentlemen whom we have named are to
                    pass for pure patriots on account of what they did for their country, why should
                    not General <abbr expan="McCandless">M'Candless</abbr> be credited with an equal
                    amount of patriotism?</p>
                <p>To men who recognize merit wherever found, who concede honor to whom honor is
                    due, we appeal in this instance. This waging of a crusade against a gallant
                    soldier because of his political faith is disgraceful. If American citizens
                    desire to do honor in reality to those who have bared their breasts to their
                    country's foes, they must discountenance this movement of selfish politicians to
                    traduce every soldier who does not cry, "great is the Radical party and great is
                    Grant its prophet."</p>
                <p>We expect to hear, before the campaign closes, the men who are now howling
                    against General <abbr expan="McCandless">M'Candless</abbr>, uttering their
                    denunciations against the other standard bearer of the Democracy, the intrepid
                    Captain Cooper. Nothing seems too mean for them to resort to, and it is hardly
                    to be expected that they will not attempt to pluck every laurel from Captain
                    Cooper's brow. This will not be an easy task, however. He has written his name
                    in blood upon the pages of Pennsylvania's history. His battery has achieved a
                    reputation which will endure as long as the story of the late war shall be told.
                    And no amount of political abuse will be able to destroy his martial fame. To
                    him future generations will accord due honor. As they read the history of his
                    struggles and triumphs, of his brave deeds and heavy losses, they, at least,
                    will not impute cowardice or disloyalty to him because, forsooth, he is a
                    Democrat.</p>
                <p>Democrats, your candidates are in every way worthy of your support. They are
                    brave men who have attested their devotion to the Union with their blood. Yet
                    they are men who believe that the military ought to be always kept subordinate
                    to the civil power. They are lovers of liberty, friends of the republic and foes
                    to military despotism. Let us stand shoulder to shoulder and show to the
                    Democracy of the Union that Pennsylvania intends to utter her protest in 1872
                    against the reelection of a man who has not the brains to be President of a
                    Republic, but who may have the boldness, as he no doubt has the inclination, to
                    attempt to become a Military Dictator in this land of liberty.</p>
