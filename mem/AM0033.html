<h3 class="section-head">Augusta County: "MAJ. JED HOTCHKISS," by unknown, 1899</h3>
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> Obituary for Major Jed Hotchkiss, Confederate engineer and map-maker, describing
                    his wartime service and postwar activities.</p>
<p>So early as the twelfth century the family of Hotchkiss was prominent in England.
                    Samuel Hotchkiss came to New Haven, Conn., in
                    1642, Windsor being a later home. The men were eminent in founding churches,
                    holding civic offices of high sheriff and marshal, and, while leading the ranks
                    in the French, Indian, and Revolutionary Wars, in times of peace were farmers
                    and inventors.</p>
<p>In 1789 David Hotchkiss came from Cheshire, Conn., to New York. Jed Hotchkiss, son of Stiles and Lydia Beecher
                    Hotchkiss, was born in Windsor, N. Y., on November
                    28, 1828. He distinguished himself at the academy, completing his Latin and
                    Greek with the pastor of the Presbyterian Church, as was the frequent custom,
                    adding French, German, Italian, Spanish, drawing, and painting as time and
                    teachers permitted. To be a minister or a teacher was his problem, but he never
                    regretted his choice of the latter profession.</p>
<p>Making a walking tour through Maryland and Virginia in 1847, he chose the Old
                    Dominion for his foster mother, and became tutor in the family of Mr. Daniel
                    Forrer. He married Miss Sara Comfort, a childhood friend, in 1853, and built the
                    Mossy Creek Academy, one of the best known in the South.</p>
<p>An ardent "old line" Whig, Mr. Hotchkiss opposed secession, but when war was
                    declared he collected his surveying and mapping appliances, and joined Gen. Garnett at Laurel Hill, feeling that his
                    topographical knowledge of the region would make him useful as an engineer. He
                    was assigned to duty with Col. Heck on July 2,
                    1861, and began a map of the region, but on McClellan's attack he was order to
                    conduct a retreat, so through a night of rain and darkness, through woods and
                    laurel swamps, he led the men over several mountain ranges, saving the commands
                    in his charge while the others were captured. As adjutant he reorganized the
                    troops at Monterey, while continuing to furnish maps, and in August he became
                    topographical engineer to Gen. R. E. Lee, at Valley
                    Mountain. As the result of reconnoissance duty
                    and exposure Engineer Hotchkiss took typhoid fever and went to his home at
                    Churchville, where careful nursing saved his life. During his convalescence he
                    made the maps for the reports of Gen. Loring and
                        Col. Heck on the Rich Mountain and Lygart's
                    Valley campaigns.</p>
<p>By invitation, in March, 1862, Engineer Hotchkiss joined Gen. T. J. (Stonewall) Jackson, near Woodstock, and was commissioned
                    topographical engineer on his staff as captain. Jackson's first order was brief
                    but comprehensive: "Prepare a complete map of the Valley, showing every point of
                    offense and defense from the Potomac to Lexington." The preceding fifteen years
                    of observation, added to facility in sketching on horseback in his field
                    notebook, with an eaglelike power of vision, soon furnished him a great fund of
                    mapping material which was transferred to the large sheets.</p>
<p>As Jackson advanced to meet Shields at Kernstown, he directed Capt. Hotchkiss to choose a line for defense, and on
                    the second day he reported the line selected at Stony Creek, at Edenburg. The
                    engineer now led a hard life, burning bridges, reconnoitering, repairing roads,
                    and rescuing wagon trains from quicksands. Once he rode all night, sixty miles,
                    without rest. The engineer entered Winchester at Jackson's side, dashed after
                    the enemy, and then returned to rally the citizens to extinguish the fires
                    lighted by the retreating foe.</p>
<p>Again reported to Jackson, Capt. Hotchkiss guided a
                    battery, led Taylor's flank movement around the Federal left, and was in the
                    attack which decided the battle of Port Republic. For such stern duties his
                    reward were the frequent crisp words, "Good, <u>very</u>
                    good," from the great "Stonewall."</p>
<p>Capt. Hotchkiss was the first to lecture on
                    "Jackson's Valley Campaign," always charming his audiences in England at
                    Amherst, Harvard, Princeton, Chapel Hill, or Washington and Lee, making maps in
                    colored crayons as he lectured. His crowning triumph was when before the learned
                    societies of Washington he gave his lecture on "Topography in War," based on the
                    Valley campaign, and the venerable historian Bancroft embraced him on the
                    rostrum, saying: "It is the best thing I ever heard in my life."</p>
<p>But to return to 1862. Capt. Hotchkiss was in the
                    battle of Cross Keys, sketched the positions on the field against Fremont's
                    front, while Jackson slipped away to Richmond, surprising all the world save
                    himself.</p>
<p>From Meacham's River the engineer was sent to Staunton "to make a map." By
                    Jackson's order he mapped the region between Gordonsville and Washington, copies
                    being given to Gens. Lee, Stuart, Longstreet, and
                    Jackson, our division generals.</p>
<p>In Warrenton he bought a small compass with a chatoyant face. At the conclusion
                    of the Maryland campaign Gen. Jackson presented to
                        Capt. Hotchkiss the world-famous "old gray
                    cap," made by Mrs. Jackson herself.</p>
<p>Lee and Ewell used Hotchkiss maps for routes and movements during the Gettysburg
                    campaign. The  Chancellorsville campaign now opened, and Capt. Hotchkiss selected the route for the famous
                    flank movement around Hooker. By Gen. Lee's orders
                    the next day Capt. Hotchkiss led the ambulance and
                    escort conveying the marvelous Jackson to the Chandler house, at Guiney Station.</p>
<p>Capt. Hotchkiss now served on Gen. Ewell's staff. He rode with Ewell the first day of Gettysburg,
                    and then was sent to watch and report from Seminary Ridge. Gen. Lee said he "always had confidence in Hotchkiss maps."</p>
<p>In 1864 Gen. Lee sent Capt. Hotchkiss to choose a line of defense in the southwest valley to
                    protect the furnaces and niter works. After riding hundreds of miles he
                    presented his report, and Gen. Lee warmly
                    complimented it. At the close of the Cold Harbor campaign Capt. Hotchkiss made in one day, at Gen. Lee's request, during heavy skirmish fire, a map of the line for
                    ten miles from the Chickahominy to the Iotopotomoy Rivers.</p>
<p>On June 13, 1864, Gen. J. A. Early was placed in
                    command of the Second Corps, and Capt. Hotchkiss
                    was assigned to duty on his staff. He served Early during his Valley campaign
                    against Sheridan. With Gen. J. B. Gordon he
                    ascended Three-Topped Mountain, and made a map from there. He built a
                    footbridge, and chose "hidden ways" by which the troops approached Sheridan. The
                    remaining months of 1864 the Second Corps spent in Staunton, where Capt. Hotchkiss made the elaborate maps and reports
                    of the year, during which period he had furnished over one hundred maps used by
                    officers from Gen. Lee down.</p>
<p>He was with Rosser as engineer when the surrender came. He was paroled on May 1,
                    1865, in Staunton. His parole certificate was issued on May 27. The amnesty oath
                    was signed on June 10, and the State oath on July 12. The United States
                    Government demanded his maps, by order of Gen.
                    Grant in person, who ordered and paid for such copies as he required for his
                    reports, and courteously returned them all.</p>
<p>During the war Maj. Hotchkiss had borne a charmed
                    life. Two horses were killed under him, and at the battle of the Wilderness his
                    field glasses, which were held by their strap just over his heart, stopped a
                    ball, and so saved his life. Nearly six feet tall, he was a picture of manly
                    vigor and beauty in 1865.</p>
<p>Removing to Staunton, the county seat, Maj. Hotchkiss
                    opened a select classical school for fifteen lads, sons of his fellow-soldiers,
                    while in vacation he surveyed lands, issued maps for numerous companies, and at
                    the end of three years was fully launched as a civil, mining, and consulting
                    engineer. He also had tried to popularize the public school system, lecturing
                    with Dr. Sears, of the Peabody Fund, all through the
                    South, giving his war lectures for the benefit of churches and Confederate
                    memorial associations, and on the Sabbath gave blackboard talks on Palestine and
                    Jerusalem, graphic and delightful. He urged emigration of the best Northern and
                    foreign people, and spent the winters of 1872-73 and
                        1874-75 in England and Scotland, lecturing on the
                    resources of Virginia, notably before the Royal Society of Arts, and meeting
                    with such honorable entertainment as few private citizens had ever received up
                    to that time. "Stonewall Jackson's engineer" was a open sesame to all English
                    homes. By his efforts millions of dollars were invested in Virginia.</p>
<p>The death of Gen. Lee, in 1870, closed an important
                    event in his life, as the General had undertaken a physical survey of the South,
                    and had chosen Capt. Hotchkiss to take charge of
                    the work.</p>
<p>In 1875 he prepared for the State a "Summary of Virginia," a wonderful mass of
                    facts, figures, and detailed maps. He also was expert special agent of the
                    census of 1879 on Virginia mineral statistics. From 1880 to 1886 he published
                    "The Virginias," a vast compendium of relibable <u>data</u> on every resource of his beloved State, still an authority on such
                    points. He was the Virginia commissioner to the New Orleans Exposition, and a
                    judge of mines and mining at the World's Fair of 1893. He was expert topographer
                    to the government, and also served on the Antietam and Fredericksburg battle
                    fields commission. He was a founder and Fellow of the Geographical Society, and
                    member of the American Philosophical Society, the Mining Engineers, the American
                    Association for the Advancement of Science, the Virginia and Massachusetts
                    Historical Societies, and the Scotch-Irish and Geological Societies. He was a
                    member of the Army of Northern Virginia, and organizer and first Commander of
                    the Stonewall Jackson Camp, U. C.
                    V., of Staunton. His record reads: "Appointed June, 1861, in topological
                    engineering service on staff of Col. T. J. Heck;
                    after battle of Rich Mountain, on staff of Gen. R.
                    E. Lee, during Valley Mountain campaign. In March, 1862, assigned to staff of
                        Gen. T. J. Jackson, and continued there until
                    his death, in 1863; then remained on staff of Second Corps, Army of Northern
                    Virginia; under Gens. A. P. Hill, Ewell, and Early
                    until the end of the war, in April, 1865."</p>
<p>He was an active patron to the Y.
                        M. C. A. and a charter member of the S. P. C. A.
                    His last unfinished work was a bill before the Legislature for a geological
                    survey of Virginia. He was also a member of several large coal and iron land
                    companies. He had sent to the Confederate Publishing Company at Atlanta a
                    history of Virginia during 1861-1865, which is now being published.</p>
<p>He was an elder in the Presbyterian Church, a Sunday school superintendent, and
                    his last public appearance was on January 1, 1899, in the sanctuary he loved,
                    the church of his fathers. On the 3d he was taken with <u>la
                        grippe</u>, and meningitis ended his honorable life at eleven o'clock on
                    the night of January 17. With closed eyes and sealed ears his vigorous mind was
                    still clear, and as his soul departed he crossed his hands in prayer, raising
                    his face to heaven.</p>
<p>The "happy services" he always desired were simple, from his home, the Oaks. The
                    old hymns, "There is a land of pure delight," "How blest the righteous when he
                    dies," and "Servant of God, well done," were beautifully sung, the Scriptures
                    read, and prayers offered. The Stonewall Jackson Camp escorted him to his rest.
                    His fellow-elders, former pupils, public men, and near friends bore his body.
                    Over him were placed three Confederate flags sent by tender hands. Of "the old
                    staff" Rev. James P. Smith, D. D., of Richmond, was the sole
                    representative, who pronounced the benediction over the flower-covered grave of
                    one of the best of men.</p>
