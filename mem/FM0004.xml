                <p>The time for holding the second annual re-union of the survivors of the 77th
                    Regiment <orig reg="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvaeia</orig> Volunteers, is fast
                    approaching. The re-union is to take place in Chambersburg, on the 13th of
                    October, and we hope our citizens will extend the survivors of the old 77th such
                    a reception as will be befitting the occasion.</p>
                <p>The 77th was recruited by <abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> F. S. Stumbaugh,
                    assisted by <abbr expan="Lieutenant Colonel">Lieut. Col.</abbr> P. B. Housum and
                        <abbr expan="Major">Maj.</abbr> Bradford. In the original formation of the
                    Regiment, there were but eight companies, officered as follows: <abbr
                        expan="Company">Co.</abbr> A, S. R. M'Kesson; <abbr expan="Company"
                    >Co.</abbr> F, W. S. Wishert; <abbr expan="Company">Co.</abbr> G, Alex. Philips;
                        <abbr expan="Company">Co.</abbr> C, M. M'Nally; <abbr expan="Company"
                    >Co.</abbr> D, J. R. Frey; <abbr expan="Company">Co.</abbr> B, T. E. Rose. To
                    these eight companies a battery was attached, commanded by <abbr expan="Captain"
                        >Capt.</abbr> Muchler. <orig reg="Company">Compang</orig> B was raised in
                        <orig reg="Pittsburgh">Pittsburg</orig>, and subsequently three others from
                    that vicinity were added to the regiment, officered by <abbr expan="Captain"
                        >Capt.</abbr> W. A. Robinson, Sidney J. Brauff, and James Shock.</p>
                <p>During the term of its service, nearly 2000 names were upon the roll of the
                    Regiment.-But 60 per cent of this number are now living, and out of the original
                    800, who left this place in 1861, (October 13), but 120 are now living.</p>
                <p>The 77th Regiment was the only Pennsylvania regiment that participated in the
                    battle of Shiloh. The commander of the Division, <abbr expan="Major General"
                        >Maj. Gen.</abbr> Alex. McD. Mcook, in his official report, paid a glowing
                    tribute to it gallantry in the final charge on that bloody field. In the action
                    at Stone River, where <abbr expan="Lieutenant Colonel">Lieut. Col.</abbr> Housum
                    fell while leading a charge, the conduct of the 77th won from <abbr
                        expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Rosecrans the highest commendation as the "only
                    regiment in its corps that did not break during the entire engagement."</p>
                <p>We presume the programme of this second re-union of the Regiment will be made
                    public at an early day, as the time is near at hand when the arrangements will
                    be made. <abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> F. S. Stumbaugh and <abbr
                        expan="Captain">Capt</abbr> G. W. Skinner, of this place, were present at
                    the first re-union at <orig reg="Pittsburgh">Pittsburg</orig> last year, the
                    first named gentleman in the absence of <abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> F. S.
                    Pyfer, presiding.</p>
