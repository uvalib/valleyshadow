                <p>Reprint of wartime article from the Chambersburg Dispatch that called for
                    soldiers drafted from Franklin county to remain in position to defend the area
                    from Confederate raiding parties.</p>
            </div1>
        </front>
        <body id="d4">
            <div1 type="article" id="d5">
                <p>The Chambersburg Dispatch argues with some force, that our "draft" men ought to
                    be kept along the Border. We make an extract:-</p>
                <p>"Our people should be organized, equipped, armed and drilled, at this place, and
                    stationed at proper points along the Border, or the Government should see that,
                    after having taken from the community its main reliance for defence, the lives
                    and homes of our people are not left longer exposed to the attacks of a bold and
                    daring enemy. As long as the rebels occupy Virginia, there is a necessity for a
                    force <orig reg="to be">tobe</orig> kept at such fords and passes as would most
                    likely to be used by the enemy in making a dash or raid into this State, and a
                    company of our drafted men placed at these various points, with the aid of one
                    or two pieces, each, of artillery, could either successfully resist such
                    attempts, or at least give timely warning of their approach, when more effectual
                    means could be adopted to either repel or capture the enemy. Either protect the
                    Border by other troops, or leave our own people here to do so."</p>
                <p>But why should these men take up winter quarters at Chambersburg? If they are to
                    be used for the protection of the Border, why not place them along the Potomac;
                    but if they cannot be taken out of the State, then let them, by all means, be
                    placed along the Line. But, then, we need only go back as far as last September,
                    to find that, when danger threatens us all troops must be kept at Chambersburg,
                    as there is no other place worthy of protection but that ancient borough, whose
                    people want to be safe, and whose business men want to reap a golden harvest by
                    the sale of <orig reg="merchandise">merchandize</orig> and wares to the
                    soldiers. Give up all the rest, but save Chambersburg.</p>
