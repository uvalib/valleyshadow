<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> A letter tells of the death of a soldier who continued to fight even after his
                    enlistment had run out.</p>
<p>
                    <b>It was a Brave, True and Loyal Spirit that Prompted Simon
                        Rupley to Fight as a Private Citizen in the Ranks with His Commands After
                        His Enlistment Had Expired</b>
                </p>
<p>During the Civil War, the late Jacob Pensinger received the following letter from
                    Captain Andrew R. Davison, who was in comand of Company K. during the battle of
                        Chancellersville. All soldiers memtioned in the letter were Greencastle boys, some
                    of whom were serving their inlistment. Mr. William
                    Snively mentioned in the letter is a resident of Greencastle.</p>
<p>Camp near Fatmouth, Va.<br> May 7th. 1863.</p>
<p>Mr. Jacob Pensinger</p>
<p>Dear Sir:-Having arrived in camp late last evening, I take this the first
                    opportunity to inform you of the death of Sergt
                    Simon W. Rupley of my Company. He was severely wounded in the action near Chancellersville about 11 o'clock A. M. on the
                    third of May and died on the evening of that day in the hospital of our
                    division.</p>
<p>In him we have lost one of the best soldiers in the company, and Greencastle
                    certainly one of its best citizens. I have received from the surgeon in charge
                    of the hospital what notions he had in his pockets when he died, Viz-1 pocket
                    book containing $7.65, 1 knife, comb, testament and etc. He was buried in a
                    coffin near the hospital.</p>
<p>You please communicate these facts to his wife and oblige.</p>
<p>Yours respectfully<br>Capt. A. R. Davison, Co. K.</p>
<p>P. S. - Your brother David escaped unhurt.
                    Lieutenant Rowe is severely wounded though not dangerously, George Missavy died
                    of his wounds. John Rebinsoa, Wm. F. Rupert, Scott
                    K. Snively, Iac Winger and John Beamisdefer were all slightly wounded. In Co. B, Johnathan Bowman is missing I don't know who
                    are wounded.</p>
<p>Wm. H. Snively of Co.
                    K. is also missing and I suppose taken prisoner, at least we have not heard from
                    him since the action.</p>
<p>I will take the articles from Sergt. Rupley home
                    with me when I come home which will be between 15th and 20th of month.<br>
                    Andy.</p>
<p>Mr. Rupley's death was all the more sad owing to the fact, that his time of inlistment had expired and there was no need for him
                    going into battle, other than his own sense of duty. It was a brave, ture and loyal spirit that forced him to fight as a
                    private citizen in the ranks with his comrads after
                    his enlistment had expired. He could have saved his life, but to savd his country was his thought and purpose, and to that
                    end he went into battle and laid his life upon its alter. that through his death and thousands like him, liberty might live
                    and transcend the ages</p>
