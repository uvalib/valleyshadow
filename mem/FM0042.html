                            1914</h3>
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> In 1914, Kauffman's Progressive reprinted this article--originally printed in
                    1862--which reports the accomplishments of the Ladies' Aid Society of
                    Greencastle.</p>
<p>This society has been doing a great deal for the sick and wounded soldiers. For
                    weeks past, the ladies have been preparing delicacies, and making lint and
                    bandages.</p>
<p>Since the recent battles in Maryland they have been sending large quantities of
                    provisions to the hospitals. In one lot sent week before last, were the
                    following: 4 barrels, (60 loaves) bread, a large quantity of rusk, 11 crocks
                    plum and apple butter, 1 keg onions, 4 sacks dried fruit, 5 pounds white sugar,
                    1 bonnet for hospital nurse, and 57 pocket handkerchiefs.</p>
<p>The following wore sent on Saturday last:-bread (seventy loaves,) rusks,
                    (twenty-three dozen), jam (seven jars), pillows, (ten); pocket handkerchiefs,
                    (fifteen).</p>
<p>The President has visited the hospitals to which these goods are sent viz.
                    Smoketown, French's and Hoffman's all of them near the battle field of the
                    Antietam. These articles are very much needed, and we are glad that our people
                    have contributed so liberally.</p>
