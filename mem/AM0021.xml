                <p>William Churchman Geiger, son of Franklin T. and Octavia R. Geiger, was born in
                    Staunton, <abbr expan="Virginia">Va.</abbr>, November 30, 1844. When he was six
                    years old, his father died, leaving three sons dependent upon their mother, who
                    taught school for their support. He also taught in the blind asylum at Staunton
                    for many years.</p>
                <p>When the war came on, William Geiger, with his two brothers, applied for
                    enlistment in the Confederate army. He was retained for the service of the State
                    and had charge of the government stores and arsenal at Staunton, which supplied
                    munitions for the armies operating in Northwest Virginia. With others, he was
                    organized into a company known as the Staunton Artillery, or the Raid Guard,
                    which was drilled for service under Captain Balthis. Several times they were
                    called out to repel threatened raids; and in December, 1863, they encountered
                    severe weather at Buffalo Gap, from which they suffered intensely. His company
                    was regularly commissioned by President Davis. The only member now living is
                    Newton Argenbright, Clerk of the County Court at Staunton, <abbr
                        expan="Virginia">Va.</abbr></p>
                <p>William Geiger joined the Stonewall Camp of Confederate Veterans at Staunton and
                    was awarded the Southern cross of honor. On August 24, 1871, he married Fanny
                    Crosby Churchman, who died several years ago. After the war he continued his
                    work at the blind asylum until his eyesight failed. He then lived on his farm
                    until his house burned, in 1904. Failing health preventing further work, he
                    spent his latter years with his son, <abbr expan="Doctor">Dr.</abbr> J. C.
                    Geiger, at Huntington, <abbr expan="West Virginia">W.Va.</abbr>, where he died
                    February 15, 1916. He was a member of the Presbyterian Church and afterwards of
                    the Emmanuel Protestant Episcopal Church. Though hindered by difficulties he
                    faithfully aimed to perform his duties to his God, his family, and his State,
                    and was a good soldier of Jesus Christ. Camp Garnett thus honors his memory.</p>
