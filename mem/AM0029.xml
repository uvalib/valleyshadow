                <p>The late <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> J. D. Imboden, in reply to an
                    invitation by <abbr expan="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Garnett to be present at the
                    dedication of the monument, wrote his regret in being unable to attend, and
                    added:</p>
                <p>I regret it because it would have enabled me to drop a tear of more than ordinary
                    fraternal affection upon the grave of one of the nearest and dearest friends I
                    ever had, the immortal Ashby. We were friends before the war began. We were
                    together in Richmond on the night of April 16, 1861, and, with others, planned
                    the attack upon and capture of Harper's Ferry; and on the morning of April 17,
                    the day Virginia seceded, we set out for our respective homes; he to lead his
                    cavalry company, I to take the Staunton Artillery, and meet at Harper's Ferry
                    before daybreak on April 19 with some other volunteers-one company from
                    Charlottesville, one from Culpeper, and others from adjacent counties. Then our
                    former friendship ripened into the most devoted attachment, which was to end on
                    his part by his glorious soldier's death, near Harrisonburg, on the evening of
                    June 6, 1862. The next day I received an order, written in pencil on the blank
                    margin of a newspaper, from our great commander, Stonewall Jackson, to join him
                    with my little command during the ensuing night at Port Republic, with a
                    postscript that conveyed the first intelligence I had of the fate of my peerless
                    friend. It was couched in these words: " I know that you will share my grief
                    over the death of our mutual friend, the gallant Ashby, who was killed last
                    evening in a charge upon the enemy. The Confederacy had no truer or braver
                    soldier, nor Virginia any nobler gentleman.' Such was the spontaneous tribute of
                    one whose testimony is in itself a monument that will stand out on the pages of
                    Virginia's history even when the structure reared by the untiring efforts of
                    noble Virginia women at the University of Virginia shall have crumbled into dust
                    under the inexorable laws of the physical world.</p>
                <p>It is the grave of such a man in the midst of his fallen comrades that would have
                    invested the ceremonies of the day with a sacredness in my heart never to have
                    been erased as long as life lasts.</p>
                <p>I have turned this morning to <abbr expan="Volume">Vol.</abbr><abbr expan="12"
                        >XII.</abbr>, Series I, page 712, of the "Official Records" of the war, and
                    find this reference to Ashby's death, in Stonewall Jackson's report of his great
                    "Valley Campaign of 1862." Describing the skirmish of June 6, 1862, near
                    Harrisonburg, he says: "In this skirmish our infantry loss was seventeen killed
                    and fifty wounded. In this affair <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Turner Ashby
                    was killed. An official report is not an appropriate place for more than a
                    passing notice of the distinguished dead, but the close relation which <abbr
                        expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Ashby bore to my command for most of the
                    previous twelve months will justify me in saying that as a partisan officer I
                    never knew his superior. His daring was proverbial, his powers of endurance
                    almost incredible, his tone of character heroic, and his sagacity almost
                    intuitive in divining the purposes and movements of the enemy." If these words
                    be not carved upon the marble that marks his resting-place, no matter, for they
                    are inscribed and imperishable on the pages-the brightest and the saddest
                    pages-of Virginia's history.</p>
