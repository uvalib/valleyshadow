                            30,1903</h3>
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> This history describes Imboden's seizure of Charlestown, WV and then his quick
                    retreat when faced with a much larger force. It is very complimentary to Gen.
                    Imboden.</p>

                    <b>A War Incident in Which the Ninth Maryland Federal Regiment
                        Figured-An Act of Kindness that was Remembered.</b>
                </p>
<p>About the 15th of October, 1863, General Imboden's Brigade was encamped in
                    Rockingham county, Virginia, when he received an order from General Lee to
                    proceed to Berryville, meet General Stuart there and in conjunction with him
                    make an attack on Harper's Ferry and Charlestown, and, if possible, capture
                    both.</p>
<p>General Sullivan's (Federal) Brigade was at the Ferry, and the Ninth Maryland
                    (Federal) Regiment of Infantry and a squadron of cavalry at Charlestown, which
                    is eight miles from the Ferry.</p>
<p>Imboden had to guard all the gaps in the mountains from Beverley to Harper's
                    Ferry, and consequently never had his full brigade in camp together at one time.
                    At this time he had less than 1,000 men with him.</p>
<p>General John D. Imboden raised the Staunton Artillery before the war, and it was
                    the first battery that took the field in Virginia. It  took a very
                    conspicuous part in the first battle of Manassas, and on account of the skillful
                    way his guns were handled that day Imboden was promoted from captain to
                    brigadier-general. Both Johnston and Beauregard complimented him in their
                    official reports of that battle.</p>
<p>Imboden's Brigade, at the time of the order mentioned above, was composed of the
                    Sixty-second Virginia Mounted Infantry, commanded by that distinguished officer,
                    Colonel George W. Smith, a graduate of the Virginia Military Institute; the
                    Eighteenth Virginia Cavalry, by the General's brother, Colonel George W.
                    Imboden, now a prominent lawyer in West Virginia; White's Battalion, by Major
                    Robert White, late Attorney-General of West Virginia; the Maryland Battalion, by
                    Major Sturgis Davis, of Maryland, who had won his laurels under Turner Ashby;
                    Gilmor's Battalion of Rangers, by Harry Gilmor, of Baltimore, who was as rough
                    and daring a rider as ever drew a saber; McNeil's Rangers, of Hardy and
                    Hampshire counties, West Virginia, commanded by Captain John H. McNeil. This was
                    the company that later in the war, under the immediate command of Jesse McNeil,
                    son of Captain J. H. McNeil, first lieutenant of Company D, rode into
                    Cumberland, Md., and brought out two
                    major-generals, Crook and Kelly, from the very midst of their commands. Finally,
                    McClanahan's Battery, commanded by Captain John H. McClanahan, a Texan, who had
                    served under Ben McCullough in Texas until it got too peaceable there for him.</p>
<p>So, as may be seen, our General had in his brigade a lot of choice spirits, and
                    was well equipped to make a daring raid into the enemy's lines.</p>
<p>The writer had the honor to command a section of McClanahan's Battery.</p>
<p>Some years ago a Yankee major, giving an account of the capture of Charleston,
                    said:</p>
<p>"The Johnnies had some pretty darned smart officers during the war, and some of
                    them that did the most effective work were the least heard of. Imboden was one
                    of them. He was a smashing good soldier, had the true instincts of a cavalryman,
                    and was as much at home in the saddle for a three days' ride to raid an outpost,
                    as he would have been playing bean poker for apple brandy in a crossroads
                    grocery in the Shenandoah mountains."</p>
<p>Now, nothing delighted a Confederate soldier's heart more than  to be
                    ordered to the lower valley of Virginia. They used to speak of it as the "land
                    where the flowers always bloomed and the birds always sung." They never failed
                    to meet a warm and cordial welcome there from the noble women who were so
                    devoted to the cause we were fighting for. Every may from that section able to
                    carry arms was in the Confederate army. Some belonged to the Stone-Brigade, some
                    to Stuart's Cavalry, and some to Chew's celebrated Battery of Horse Artillery.
                    There were two companies of cavalry-the Clark Cavalry, Company D, 6th Virginia,
                    and Baylor's Company, Company B, 12th Virginia. Most of the men in these two
                    companies were from the counties of Clark and Jefferson, sons of well-to-do
                    farmers, who from early boyhood were accustomed to riding and handling the fine
                    horses for which that section was celebrated. On one occasion I heard a
                    distinguished Confederate officer say of them that he did not believe there were
                    ever two finer bodies of mounted men on earth.</p>
<p>Our advance arrived in Berryville late in the evening of the 17th of October, and
                    drove a scouting party of the enemy out of town. We did not find Stuart there,
                    as we expected, our scouts reporting that he could not cross the Shenandoah
                    river on account of high water. The General decided to attack Charlestown alone,
                    if he could find out what was there. A council of war was held and Major Davis
                    volunteered to go to the vicinity of Charlestown and find out. To this the
                    General agreed, and went into camp to take a short rest before his return. The
                    Major knew two renegade Southerners who lived within a mile of the place, and he
                    aroused one of them about midnight and demanded the information he desired. The
                    man told him that his brother (who held a position under the bogus Yankee
                    Virginia Government), was in the town and that the (loyal) people there were
                    very much incensed against him and that he was afraid he would be handled
                    roughly if he was captured. But he said that if the Major would allow him to get
                    his brother out he would give him the information he desired. This was agreed
                    to, and the Major obtained the necessary information, and returned to camp in
                    time for us to get to Charlestown by daybreak.</p>
<p>The rays of light from the approaching day began to peep over the Blue Ridge and
                    a long stretch of fog hung over the Shenandoah like a lake reaching toward the
                    ferry. The landscape around the town was dotted with handsome country
                    residences, for Charlestown is in the midst of a rich farming country. The town
                    lay sleeping before us, the inhabitants little dreaming that their friends and
                        deliv-erers were so close around them, or that they would soon
                    be awakened by the boom of Confederate guns, and hear the joyful sound of
                    Confederate horsemen dashing over their streets. I was with my section on the
                    Berryville pike, and my orders from the General were that as soon as the pickets
                    were driven in we should make a dash for the courthouse, where he said the enemy
                    was quartered, and open on it promptly, as there was no time to lose.</p>
<p>My boys were enthusiastic when they heard the order and were eager for the
                    command to move. The General sent Captain McNeil and his adjutant, Captain F. B.
                    Berkeley, in with a flag of truce to demand an immediate and unconditional
                    surrender. Colonel Simpson, the officer in command, gallantly replied: "Come and
                    take us if you can." We met them just before we got to the courthouse and they
                    said: "Hurry up, Lieutenant, they have refused to surrender. The building is
                    loopholed and you will have to be quick or they will kill your men before you
                    can unlimber."</p>
<p>As we entered the town a small boy came out of a house and I called him to show
                    me the way to the courthouse. His eyes sparkled with excitement and he said:
                    "Take me up behind you, and I will show you." When we got near the courthouse he
                    said: "As soon as you turn that corner you can see it." I said to the youngster:
                    "Now, you get off, for they will fire on us as soon as they see us and you might
                    be killed." He replied: "Oh! please let me go along with you; I am not afraid."
                    I had to pull him off my horse and, as he struck the ground, he called after me:
                    "I am going, anyhow." And he did, sure enough.</p>
<p>As we turned the corner I saw the Yankees standing at the big windows with their
                    guns in their hands. The courtroom was in the second floor. Just as we got
                    unlimbered I heard the Yankee officer give the command to fire, and as I gave
                    the same command, they poured a volley into us, but, strange to say, did not
                    kill a single man. We fired several times rapidly, and soon the courthouse was
                    obscured by the smoke. I discovered that they had stopped firing and gave the
                    command to my men to cease firing. When the smoke cleared away I saw that the
                    enemy had gone. We were so close and the room was so high that our shots had
                    gone under them and I found that we had only wounded one man, a field officer.
                    Poor fellow! he was lying, horribly wounded, on the courthouse steps. He had on
                    a beautiful sword, which he said had been presented to him, and which he asked
                    to be allowed to retain. We fixed him as comfortably as we could and laid the
                    sword by his side. The enemy  had gone out of town by the Harper's
                    Ferry road, but were almost immediately charged by the 18th Regiment, and threw
                    down their arms. Captain Julian Pratt made a dash for the color bearer and
                    secured the colors. Colonel Simpson broke through our lines and struck out for
                    the ferry with Harry Gilmor in hot pursuit, but reached the troops coming to his
                    relief before Harry overtook him. A lucky man!</p>
<p>As soon as I saw that the Yankees were out of the courthouse I sent two men with
                    a wagon and four horses, which we discovered hitched up near the courthouse, to
                    go in and load up with plunder, for the Yankees had left everything behind in
                    their flight. I especially gave orders to get all the knapsacks and blankets
                    possible. I did not see my captain any more until the next day at Front Royal.
                    We were looking forward to having a supply of blankets and clothing to last the
                    company through the winter, but to our bitter disappointment the men had loaded
                    the wagon with drums-thirteen drums-drums of all sorts and sizes. I turned them
                    over to Colonel Smith, of the 62d, and he organized a fine drum corps.</p>
<p>The General came along and said: "Hurry up and get out of town, for the enemy are
                    coming in heavy force from Harper's Ferry." Captain M. Frank Imboden was put in
                    charge of the prisoners and he took them through the town at a double quick,
                    followed by the small boys, black and white, yelling and jeering at them. We
                    followed and found the streets full of girls, waving their handkerchiefs and
                    cheering with wild delight, but they soon changed their tunes when they found
                    that we were going to leave them again in the hands of the hated enemy. They
                    begged and entreated us to stay, and although we hated to do it we had to go,
                    and go fast, for a much larger force than we had came into one end of the town
                    as we went out of the other.</p>
<p>I tried to get the girls to leave the streets so that I could rake it with a
                    parting load of canister, but they were too enthusiastic to do so and we would
                    not have risked a hair of their dear heads to kill a thousand Yankees. The enemy
                    followed us as far as Berryville and made several desperate and gallant efforts
                    to recapture their friends, making it warm for us and giving us a running fight
                    all all the way. We fired our guns <u>en echelon</u>,
                    some firing and some retreating. Several times they came near capturing them. At
                    one place, I remember especially, they got on our right flank and within a few
                    feet of us before we could turn our guns about, when Major Gilmor charged them
                    and saved us. Just as he made the dash at them his  horse was
                    killed, but in a second he was on another horse and right after the man who had
                    shot his horse. In the charge he recaptured two of our men that the enemy had
                    taken.</p>
<p>The Yankee Major in his account says: "Imboden, with half a dozen shells and a
                    volley or two of carbine and pistol shots and considerable dash, had scooped in
                    pretty nearly as many as his own force numbered. Our folks were never very proud
                    of that day's work. The whole day was a stern chase, but occasionally, when
                    Imboden was pressed too closely and was in need of time to keep the prisoners
                    plunder ahead out of the wav, he stopped long enough to give us a sharp taste of
                    fighting that showed the metal that was in him."</p>
<p>In another page of the Major's story he says: "Our guns were well at work and as
                    Minor was short of officers I was directing one of his sections, when, with a
                    whoop and a yell, out of a thick undergrowth a little to our rear, came a couple
                    of Harry Gilmor's squadrons, with that dare-devil sabreur leading them, not more
                    than fifty yards away, and, of course, it did not take long for them to 'git
                    there.' The rush was so sudden and unlooked for that our support gave way and
                    Gilmor made straight for our guns, rode right over and past them, sabers
                    slashing and pistols firing as they went. I had been tugging like blazes at my
                    revolver, but could not get the blamed thing out, and as they rode over us a
                    long-legged, redheaded fellow made a vicious slash at me over the wheel. I
                    promptly dodged under the muzzle of the gun and he did not reach me. 'Fours left
                    wheel' rang out and back they came before you could draw your breath. I laid for
                    the son of saber that had reached for me before, for I had got my gun out by
                    this time. I did not see my read-headed friend, but a handsome, dark-mustached
                    youngster, a boy in looks, was making a point to run me through. Durn my
                    buttons, gentlemen, if that sabre did not look as long
                    as a fence rail. I dropped flat under the gun's axle and the boy swept past. As
                    far as my experience goes that dash of Gilmor's was one of the handsomest things
                    of the kind that occurred during the war."</p>
<p>The Major is mistaken about the two squadrons. Harry hardly had one with him at
                    that time.</p>
<p>The poor prisoners were on foot and we were mounted, so they had a hard time of
                    it, but as soon as their friends stopped the pursuit we gave them a good rest.
                    We got safely back to our camp in Rockingham. Our loss of killed and wounded was
                    not great.</p>
<p>An interesting incident in this connection is that these prisoners 
                    got to the Valley pike at Newmarket (I think it was) where their officers were
                    paroled and put in charge of Major Houston Hall, of the 62d Virginia (Mounted)
                    Infantry. The gallant and amiable Major hired conveyances for the whole party at
                    Newmarket, and, a sufficient store of old apple brandy having been laid in, the
                    journey to Staunton was made very pleasant for all hands.</p>
<p>The truth of the proverb that "Kindness is never thrown away" has seldom been
                    better illustrated than in this case. Some time during the winter of 1864-65
                    Major Hall had the misfortune to be captured, and was sent to Fort Delaware for
                    safe keeping. I was there at the same time and recollect very well when the news
                    was brought into our barracks that a new regiment had come to release the one
                    that had for some time been doing guard duty on the island. In a little while
                    word of inquiry for Major Hall of the 62d Virginia, was passed through the
                    barracks. The Major answered the call and went off with the orderly, wondering
                    what was wanted with him, and so did we who waited for his return. This return
                    took place just after the tattoo was beaten on the garrison drums, when Major
                    Hall came into his division of barracks under the friendly escort of a couple of
                    officers of the newly arrived guard regiment. It did not take long for the Major
                    to explain that this regiment was the Eleventh Maryland and that he had been out
                    to dinner with their mess. That he had been well dined by somebody was evident
                    to the meanest capacity. The Eleventh remained on guard over us for several
                    weeks, and Major Hall spent most of his time, during the days, in the quarters
                    of its officers, returning at night to barracks.</p>
<p>The beautiful Valley of Virginia was overrun and its people robbed and plundered
                    many times. At the close of the war there was scarcely a barn or mill standing
                    from Harper's Ferry to Staunton, and the renegade Hunter destroyed many of its
                    beautiful country residences. The returning survivors of the great struggle
                    found only ruin and desolation, but with the same heroic spirit that inspired
                    them through the bloody struggle they went to work and in a few years the valley
                    bloomed like a rose garden, barns, mills, residences, fences were built, and now
                    everything looks lovely. But they haven't forgotten the cause they fought for
                    nor the heroes who fell in its defense. Go into their cemeteries and you will
                    find beautiful monuments erected to the memory of the noble dead; go into their
                    homes and you will find matrons with silvered heads, who can tell you of scenes
                    of horror that they have witnessed, and their eyes will grow  bright
                    again when they tell you of the deeds of daring and gallantry of the men who
                    wore the gray.</p>
