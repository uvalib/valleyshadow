<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> The article contains a letter from a private citing "duty" as his reason for
                    enlisting.</p>
<p>No Braver Soldier Ever Fell Upon the Field of Battle and No More Loving Mother
                    Ever Waited in Vain His Return</p>
<p>The following letter is only interesting to the general public in so far as it
                    gives an insight into the mental attitude and run of thought of those who fully
                    realize what war means and who live under a strain of fear and hope that at
                    times sinks almost to the depth of despair, and then again, rises to exaultation and joy, out of fear on going into
                    battle and joy on coming out. The soldier at no time is his natural self. He is
                    living a life that has but two meanings, life or an untimely death from which
                    the normal man shrinks in compliance with the law of God and nature. The soldier
                    may so far be the master of himself as to conceal all outward manifestations of
                    fear, but deep down in his heart is the concealed evidence, which be will impart only to mother, as seen in Mr. Simon Rupley's letter.</p>
<p>How thankful he is to mother for the articles of ware she sent him, and why?
                    Because they came as he says from mother. He then takes her into his confidence
                    and tells her why he went into the army when he could have remained at home,
                    Duty. Duty was the controling spirit of his life.
                    Duty to country forced him to forsake home friends and personal welfare to take
                    chances on the field of battle. The going of others was nothing to or did it
                    excuse him. He must play his part, cost what it may, and he did, keeping in mind
                    as he said to his mother that "I hope through a merciful God to be spared to get
                    home." But it was otherwise decreeded and he fell mortally wounded at
                    Chancellorsville in compliance with thy will be done.</p>
<p>No braver soldier ever fell upon the field of battle and no more loving mother
                    ever waited in vain his return.</p>
<p>Camp Near Fredericksburg, Va.<br> January 30 1863.</p>
<p>My Dear Mother;<br> I have intended to write to you for a long time but have put
                    it off and this morning I have a little time and will write a little to you. I
                    received the mittens and stockings you knit for me this morning and am very much
                    obliged to you for them, although I was not in want of them, they were, very
                    thankfully received from you and I have them on now, that is the stockings, and
                    the mittens fits me very well. But as a general thing it is hardly worth while to send stockings to the army as we can
                    get as many woolen stockings from Government at twenty-six cents a pair, as we
                    want and that is lower than you can knit them for but they are so much better
                    when they come from mother. I suppose of course you are thinking of me a great
                    deal since I am gone and particularly while the late battle was going on and
                    also think that I could have staid at home. But mother
                    I could not have staid at home any longer and felt
                    like a man for I was not contented since the rebellion broke out and only went
                    because I felt it my duty to my country to go and if I am spared to get home at
                    the end of my time I have only done my duty which all should do. I know it was
                    hard for me to go and others could have gone with less sacrifice but that would
                    not have done for me, it is a question each man has to answer for himself and I
                    broke the tie that bound me to home and friends which was the hardest trial I
                    have had yet, the charge not accepted but yet I hope through a merciful God that
                    I will be spared to get home again and then the hardships and privations I have
                        enduced will appear as nothing compared with the
                    joy of getting home and having served my country for nine months You and Becca
                    will have to get along together as you have and do the best for each other you
                    can until I return. I will not write about the fights as I suppose you have read
                    my letter. I am almost well of my cold and fell very well and hope that my
                    health and life may be spared to return home. But the future is all uncertain
                    and I am in the hands of a Merciful Porvidence in
                    whom I put my trust knowing that a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his
                    permission therefore we must bow in submission and not murmur and say thy will
                    be done and not ours. Give my best wishes to Walters. I must close hoping that
                    we may all be spared to meet again if not in this world in the next. From your
                        effectionate son</p>
<p>S. W. Rupley.</p>
