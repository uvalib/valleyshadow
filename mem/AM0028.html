<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> Brief obituary of Gen. Imboden</p>
<p>General John D. Imboden, of Confederate cavalry fame, died recently in Abingdon,
                        Va. He was a graduate of the Virginia Military
                    Institute. At the beginning of the war he raised a company for the Confederate
                    army. He rose rapidly to the command of a cavalry brigade, and participated in
                    many battles. After the war he engaged extensively in mining and railroad
                    enterprises, but met with frequent reverses and died a poor man. He was
                    seventy-five years old, and had been married four times. His last wife and
                    several children survive him.</p>
