<h3 class="section-head">Augusta County: "Fathers of Confederate Veterans," by Unknown,
                            December 1908</h3>
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> This correction to an earlier story, in which the paper reported on the last
                    living man in the county who had sons in the Confederate Army, admits that since
                    publication four other such men have surfaced, though an editor's note at the
                    bottom of the article mentions that no more names surfaced afterwards.</p>
<p>When Rev. Jacob R. Hildebrand died, it was thought
                    that he was the last man in Augusta county who had sons in the Confederate army,
                    but the statement of that fact has brought to light the names of at least four
                    men who are now living who had sons in the Confederate army. They are Mr. Henry
                    Harrison and Mr. John A. Wiseman, of Staunton; Mr. James McDaniel, of Stuart's
                    Draft, and Mr. William F. Bradley, of Cotopaxi, the last named being nearly
                    ninety-four years of age. There are not many left, however, and it is really
                    remarkable that there are any. The Rockbridge County <u>News</u> thinks there is not one left in Rockbridge.-Staunton <u>Dispatch</u>.</p>
<p>The above published in December, 1908, and copied generally by the Virginia press
                    seems to have failed to elicit any additional names.-ED.</p>
