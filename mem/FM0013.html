                            McClure, 1905</h3>
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> : Alexander McClure writes of the 1862 draft in Pennsylvania and the political
                    implications that accompanied the draft.</p>
<p>EIGHTEEN hundred and sixty-two was an eventful year in the history of the war.
                    Grant had achieved important Union victories in the Southwest, capturing Forts
                    Henry and Donaldson and Nashville, the capital of Tennessee, followed by the
                    final victory of his army at Shiloh, after having suffered a costly and
                    humiliating defeat on the first day of the battle. Missouri was in a state of
                    anarchy, the supporters and opponents of the Union making it a death struggle
                    even between neighbors. In the East bloody battles had been fought, all of which
                    were disastrous to the Union cause, with the single exception of Antietam, that
                    was practically a drawn battle. McClellan had been defeated in the Seven Days
                    battles on the peninsula, and the combined Union armies were again defeated on
                    the old Bull Run field under Pope, suffering great loss of prestige for the Army
                    of the Potomac and a fearful sacrifice of life. The Union sentiment of the State
                    was greatly chilled, and the political situation was most embarrassing for the
                    Union party.</p>
<p>A large increase of the army was an imperious necessity for the successful
                    prosecution of the war, but President Lincoln hesitated to issue a call for
                    additional troops because he feared it might result in organized opposition to
                    the further prosecution of the war. Indeed, only the few who had accurate
                    knowledge of the situation had any conception of the grave peril that confronted
                    the administration. Our great army in the East had been defeated in repeated
                    battles, its numbers were greatly reduced, and only by speedy and large
                    reinforcements could the tide of disaster be turned to victory. Governor Curtin
                    was then prostrated by a malady for which he could find no relief except in a
                    very serious surgical operation. He was utterly exhausted by his continued
                    efforts to sustain the government, but he was finally compelled to go to New
                    York, under the strict orders of his physician that no official business should
                    be permitted to reach him.</p>
<p>The President and cabinet had given very careful consideration to the question of
                    raising additional troops, and they decided that it would be unsafe for the
                    government to venture upon a call for the 300,000 additional soldiers needed
                    without having an appeal made to the government by some highly responsible and
                    representative class of men in the North. The scheme worked out by the cabinet
                    was for Secretary Seward to proceed to New York and summon a conference of the
                    mayors of the prominent cities of the North, with a view of having them unite in
                    an earnest request to the President to hasten the conclusion of the war by
                    summoning a large increase of troops for the army, to enable it to hasten the
                    overthrow of the military power of the South.</p>
<p>Seward went to New York and made his headquarters at the Astor House.
                    Fortunately, Thomas A. Scott  was with him, and he suggested to
                    Seward that Governor Curtin was in the city, and as Pennsylvania was the most
                    important State to be consulted, it might be well for the Secretary to confer
                    with Curtin. Scott was sent to present the matter to the Governor, and he was
                    soon almost entirely forgetful of his illness, and in defiance of the protest of
                    his physician, he accompanied Scott to the Astor House, where Secretary Seward
                    unfolded his plan.</p>
<p>Curtin at once said: "You are not assured of the loyalty of all the mayors of the
                    prominent cities of the East, but you have an unbroken circle of loyal Governors
                    in the Northern States, and they could make a demand upon the government for a
                    speedy and large increase of the army, with vastly more force than could the
                    mayors of the cities."</p>
<p>Seward gladly accepted the suggestion, and within a few hours Curtin had
                    responses from a large majority of the Governors of the North cordially
                    approving the proposition for a general conference, and on the 14th of
                    September, 1861, the following call was issued for what is now known in the
                    history of the war as the Altoona conference:</p>
<p>We invite a meeting of the Governors of the loyal States to be held at Altoona,
                    Pa., on the 24th inst.</p>
<p>A. G. Curtin, Pennsylvania.<br>David Todd, Ohio.<br>F. H. Pierpont, Virginia.</p>
<p>
                    
                </p>
<p>The call was responded to by nearly all, and I believe quite all of the loyal
                    Governors of the North, with the single exception of Governor Morgan, of New
                    York, who declined for reasons that were never given to the public. After the
                    call had been issued, but before the meeting was held, the battle of Antietam
                    was fought  that gave the semblance of victory to the Union army,
                    and the preliminary emancipation proclamation had been issued by the President,
                    who had personally conferred with a large number of the loyal Governors on the
                    subject, and it was well understood that the Altoona conference was not only
                    called for the speedy and large increase of the army, but to indorse the
                    emancipation policy of the government.</p>
<p>The address to the President was written chiefly by Governor Andrew, of
                    Massachusetts, assisted by Governor Curtin, and after it was adopted it was
                    decided that the members of the conference should call upon the President in
                    person to give the greatest possible effect to their action.</p>
<p>This conference, with the earnestly patriotic tone of the utterances made by the
                    Governors, and of the formal address they presented to the President, at once
                    lifted the North out of the slough of despair, and Lincoln was entirely clear to
                    call for 300,000 additional troops. It was, in fact, the turning point of the
                    war, and but for the precaution taken to educate the loyal sentiment in the
                    North up to the point of accepting the fearful sacrifices necessary to sustain
                    the Union, it is doubtful whether the government could have been successful in
                    replenishing the broken lines of our army.</p>
<p>A call had been made for 300,000 troops on the 7th of July, 1862, and the quota
                    of Pennsylvania was about 17,000 or 18,000, and it was evident that the quota
                    could not be furnished by volunteers. The bounty system that was soon thereafter
                    inaugurated, and that later grew to fearful proportions, had not then been
                    resorted to, and a draft to fill our quota became an imperative necessity.</p>
<p>The National conscription act did not become operative until 1863, and there was
                    no authority in the  government to draft men for a period exceeding
                    nine months. To organize and execute a draft in a great State like Pennsylvania
                    was a most appalling task, as it involved the most careful visitation to every
                    household in the State to ascertain the names of those who were subject to
                    military duty, and to ascertain, also, how many volunteers were then in the
                    service from each township or ward. After such enumeration an exhaustive
                    tabulation of the conscripts due from each of the two thousand districts in the
                    State was necessary, and, after the draft, each conscript had the right to
                    appeal to a commissioner and surgeon of the county to claim that he had lawful
                    reasons for not accepting military service. The draft had to be made by State
                    officers, and their compensation depended upon individual settlements with the
                    National government.</p>
<p>When the Legislature adjourned in the spring of 1862 I had given five years of
                    continuous service in one or the other branch, and for more than two years, with
                    my duties as chairman of the State committee, and the exhaustive duties required
                    at Harrisburg, I had practically no time to give to professional, personal or
                    private interests. I announced at the adjournment of the Legislature that I
                    would not be a candidate for re-election to the senate, and would not continue
                    as chairman of the State committee. I greatly needed rest, and long-neglected
                    business interests demanded my attention. I felt a most gratifying sense of
                    relief when I went home, believing that I could have a season of rest with no
                    more than the ordinary business interests to be cared for.</p>
<p>When Curtin found that a draft was a necessity, he well understood the magnitude
                    of the movement, and how easily it could be made disastrous in alienating loyal
                    Democratic sentiment if the draft had even the  semblance of
                    partisanship in its execution. He sent for me and made an earnest appeal to me
                    to take charge of the draft, but I could not entertain it. Just when I had hoped
                    for a season of rest from the most wearing labors, I was confronted with the
                    proposition to accept the most responsible and delicate duties that could be
                    presented. He was very positive in urging my acceptance, but I was resolute in
                    declining, and he could not but confess that I had good reasons for it.</p>
<p>I returned home happy in the belief that I had escaped a fearful responsibility;
                    but the next day I received a telegram from the President and proceeded to
                    Washington. He informed me that Curtin had presented the situation in
                    Pennsylvania to him, and said that he had sent for me to urge as a personal
                    service to himself that I should take personal charge of the draft in
                    Pennsylvania. It was not possible to refuse the President, and I most
                    reluctantly acceded to his wishes.</p>
<p>The mere matter of making the enumeration in the State and calculating the quota
                    of each district was not the alarming feature of the new duty I had accepted.
                    Competent men could be employed for the performance of all such duties, but with
                    the Democratic party only partially loyal to the government and the Republican
                    party disheartened to the verge of despair, it was an imperious necessity that
                    the draft should be executed at every stage and in every feature with open and
                    absolute freedom from all partisan or personal interests.</p>
<p>I reported to the Governor and told him that I had agreed to take charge of the
                    draft without commission or compensation, requiring only that I should be
                    allowed to select two thoroughly competent clerks who should be paid by the
                    State $100 a month. That was accepted and I had most competent and faithful  service from ex-Senator James M. Sellers, of Juniata, and
                    ex-Representative John McCurdy, of Cumberland.</p>
<p>A commissioner and surgeon of the draft were required to be appointed in each
                    county of the State. Under the law it was the duty of the commissioner to
                    appoint proper canvassers to make the enumeration of each township, and the
                    surgeon and commissioner, who constituted the board, had power to discharge any
                    conscript upon proof that he was not subject to military duty, or for any other
                    reason for which he was ineligible for the service.</p>
<p>I knew that the small politicians of each county would make an earnest struggle
                    to control the commissioner and surgeon in their respective counties to wield
                    the power to assure the discharge of conscripts where it would serve political
                    ends. The selection of these officers was therefore a most important duty, and I
                    knew how the Governor would be importuned to appoint men who had rendered
                    service to the party, and who would be likely to render service to their party
                    friends in deciding appeals for release from conscript service.</p>
<p>I said to the Governor that only on one condition would I take charge of the
                    draft, and that was that in every other county of the State but his own county
                    of Centre I should be entirely free to appoint the commissioner and surgeon for
                    each county without consulting any one. I told him why I made the demand; that I
                    believed it to be absolutely necessary to have these commissioners and surgeons
                    one of each party in every county and men who would be accepted at once as
                    entirely beyond the reach of political influence to favor conscripts who desired
                    to escape from the army.</p>
<p>Curtin not only promptly assented to this, but said he would be glad to be able
                    to say to all who came to  him that the matter was not in his
                    hands, and that the appointments would be made solely with reference to the
                    military service. I was then quite familiar with the public men in every county
                    of the State, and within twenty-four hours I had made out a list of
                    commissioners and surgeons for each county.</p>
<p>The Governor had given me the names of the persons for his own county, but beyond
                    that he did not know of another appointment that was to be made until I
                    presented the list, and when he saw it he was delighted, as it at once disarmed
                    all apprehension as to partisan manipulation or other interference in the
                    execution of the draft.</p>
<p>I made William Henry Allen, Republican, then president of Girard College,
                    commissioner for Philadelphia, and Dr. Gerhard, a man eminent in his profession,
                    and a pronounced Democrat, the surgeon. In Montgomery I made James Boyd, then a
                    prominent lawyer and Democrat of Norristown, and until his death the honored
                    nestor of the bar, commissioner, with a Republican surgeon of the highest
                    character; and in Lancaster I appointed James L. Reynolds, a prominent Democrat,
                    and brother of General Reynolds, who fell at Gettysburg, the commissioner for
                    that Gibraltar of Republicanism.</p>
<p>When the list of appointments was announced, showing that the commissioners and
                    surgeons had all been selected with the single reference to their ability and
                    integrity, and both parties equally represented, public sentiment throughout the
                    entire State was at once disarmed of all apprehension as to any partisan aims in
                    the execution of the draft, and we thus had a clear field for the important task
                    that was before us.</p>
<p>While it was accepted on all sides, after the commissioners and surgeons of the
                    draft had been announced, that partisanship had been entirely eliminated in the
                         execution of the draft, there were serious danger signals in
                    several sections of the State. It is due to the truth of history to say that at
                    that time there was not a dominating public sentiment in Pennsylvania that
                    heartily supported the war. They did not want to accept the dismemberment of the
                    Union, but they were hopeful, even in the face of clearly apparent
                    impossibilities, that in some way the war might be ended by compromise, and many
                    of the sincerely loyal men of the State gravely doubted whether the military
                    power of the Confederacy could be broken, and the seceding States brought back
                    into submission to the Union. That sentiment, however, was really the creation
                    of the failure of our army in the East to make successful progress in the
                    prosecution of the war, and it was evident that Union victories in the field
                    would restore Pennsylvania to aggressive loyalty.</p>
<p>The hesitating, doubting sentiment relating to the war was not the most to be
                    feared. In several of the mining districts there were positive indications of
                    revolutionary disloyalty, and it was especially manifested in Schuylkill, where
                    the Molly Maguires were then in the zenith of their power. The center of their
                    power was in Cass Township, where thirteen murders had been committed within two
                    or three years, and not a single murderer brought to punishment. They
                    successfully dominated the politics of the county, and made even the judges and
                    court officers and jurors fear them. They had a very compact secret
                    organization, and, as was developed in the later remarkable trial and conviction
                    of the leaders by Mr. Gowan, they many times decided on the murder of an
                    individual, drew lots as to who should commit the crime, and in nearly or quite
                    every instance the chosen victim suffered a violent death. They were implacably
                    hostile to the Republican party, and to the loyal sentiment  that
                    demanded the prosecution of the war, and they openly declared their purpose not
                    to submit to the conscription that was about to be enforced.</p>
<p>I had chosen Benjamin Bannan, one of the most prominent and sagacious citizens of
                    the county, then editor of the Pottsville "Journal," as commissioner for that
                    county, not only because of his high character and admitted ability, but because
                    of his intimate knowledge of all the political ramifications of the
                    Commonwealth, including the Molly Maguires. He was very reluctant to accept the
                    position, but when the needs of the case were explained to him he finally agreed
                    to assume the task, and it was a task of appalling magnitude. He selected with
                    the greatest care the men who were to make the enumeration of these districts,
                    and although they were hindered at every stage in the immediate Molly Maguire
                    region, they managed to get a fairly accurate enumeration without provoking any
                    outbreak.</p>
<p>Cass Township had an agricultural section in it that was entirely different from
                    the Molly Maguires who ruled the mines, and the residents there were generally
                    loyal. Of course, such a township would not have an excess of volunteers in the
                    service, and an unusually large quota was officially returned to Commissioner
                    Bannan with directions to fill the same with conscripts, and on the 16th day of
                    October the list of conscripts was drawn for every district in the State, and it
                    included a few of the agricultural people of Cass Township, and a much larger
                    number of miners, all of whom were under the absolute influence of the Molly
                    Maguires. The conscripts were ordered to start for Harrisburg on a given day,
                    and those of the agricultural portion of Cass Township appeared at the depot to
                    take the train for Harrisburg, but the Molly Maguire conscripts, with a number
                    of their friends, appeared also, and not  only refused to respond
                    to the call of the State by going to Harrisburg, but riotously excluded the
                    willing conscripts from the car.</p>
<p>The facts were promptly telegraphed me by Bannan, and in turn I promptly
                    communicated them to Secretary Stanton, of the War Department. Stanton was
                    strenuously loyal and at times impetuous when confronted by open disregard of
                    law. He at once telegraphed me, assigning a regiment in Harrisburg and another
                    in Philadelphia to be subject to my orders to be sent at once to Schuylkill
                    County with orders to enforce the draft at the point of the bayonet.</p>
<p>After consultation with the Governor he urged that a conflict between our own
                    troops and rioters opposing the execution of the draft would be most disastrous
                    in its consequences, not only at home, but throughout the country, and in
                    accordance with his views I prepared an answer to Secretary Stanton suggesting
                    that haste should be avoided in forcing a conflict between the troops and the
                    Cass Township insurgents.</p>
<p>He promptly answered repeating his order that the regiments should be started at
                    once to Schuylkill County, and the draft enforced without parleying. The troops
                    were ordered to prepare at once to be transported to Pottsville in accordance
                    with the directions of the Secretary of War, and they arrived in Pottsville on
                    the following day, but no orders had been given to them beyond going to that
                    point.</p>
<p>After further conference with the Governor I prepared a dispatch in cypher [sic]
                    to President Lincoln, giving the Governor's views as to the peril of provoking a
                    conflict with the Schuylkill rioters and asked for an early answer. This
                    despatch [sic] was sent some time in the afternoon, and we were greatly
                    disappointed that no answer came to it, although I waited until two o'clock in
                    the morning, hoping to receive it. I slept little  and was up early
                    in the morning, and when I entered the breakfast room at the hotel I saw
                    Assistant Adjutaut General Townsend at the table, and he at once beckoned me to
                    come and join him.</p>
<p>I was well acquainted with him, and was greatly gratified at seeing him, as I did
                    not doubt that he had some official instructions for me. He at once informed me
                    that he had been sent by President Lincoln to see me and to deliver a personal
                    message, saying that he did not know to what the message related. He said the
                    President had instructed him to inform me that he was desirous, of course, to
                    see the law executed, or at least to appear to have been executed, to which he
                    added: "I think McClure will understand." General Townsend said: "I have no
                    knowledge as to the subject matter of this communication that I have delivered
                    exactly as instructed."</p>
<p>Without waiting for breakfast I sent a despatch [sic] to Commissioner Bannan to
                    come to Harrisburg at once, and he was there very soon after noon, and we at
                    once went to the Executive chamber and discussed the situation with the
                    Governor. Lincoln's message was well understood. Bannan was most desirous for a
                    peaceful solution of the problem, and he said that the draft could not be
                    executed in Cass Township without a bloody conflict with the Molly Maguires, and
                    he could conceive of no method by which there could be given the appearance of
                    executing the law.</p>
<p>I told him that there was but one way in which it could be done; that several
                    districts in the State had shown conclusively that their quota had been entirely
                    filled by volunteers, some of whom had enlisted in county towns or in the cities
                    and had not been properly credited to the township as the law required. Where
                    the facts were made clear I had at once revoked the order for the draft, and I
                    said that only in that way  could the Cass Township problem be
                    solved if it were practicable.</p>
<p>Bannan made no reply, but took his hat, hastened to the train and reached
                    Pottsville the same evening. On the following evening he was back in Harrisburg
                    with a large number of affidavits regularly executed before a justice of the
                    peace or notary public, proving on their face that the quota of Cass Township
                    had been filled by volunteers, chiefly by men connected with the mines who had
                    enlisted from the towns or cities where companies or regiments were being
                    formed. The affidavits were carefully tabulated and they made the quota of Cass
                    Township entirely full. They were undisputed, and I at once issued the order
                    releasing the conscripts of Cass Township from reporting for duty because the
                    quota had been filled with volunteers.</p>
<p>Commissioner Bannan did not proffer any explanation as to how the affidavits had
                    been obtained, nor did the Governor or myself make any inquiry. The law appeared
                    to be executed, although all connected with its execution were entirely
                    satisfied that the affidavits were fictitious, but it was an imperious necessity
                    to avoid a conflict between the Molly Maguires and the troops, and that was
                    accomplished by Commissioner Bannan furnishing the required affidavits that were
                    clothed with all the ceremony of law. The troops were at once ordered back from
                    Pottsville, and the draft was executed in every other district in the State
                    without trouble.</p>
<p>It is not the exact truth to say that the draft was executed in every other
                    district in the State outside of Cass Township. It will astound many of the
                    citizens of Philadelphia to be told that this loyal city did not fill its quota
                    of troops as shown to be due by the quotas issued for the draft. Philadelphia
                    was short of her quote, some 3,000 men, and I issued the order  for
                    a draft on Philadelphia just as it was issued for all the other districts of the
                    State. It aroused the greatest anxiety among the political leaders of the city,
                    as they were entirely convinced that a draft for 3,000 men made in Philadelphia
                    would defeat the Republicans at the coming election, although the actual draft
                    was not to be made until a few days thereafter. Philadelphia was regarded as the
                    one great loyal city of the Union, and an order for a draft in Republican
                    Philadelphia, when Berks and Lehigh, the Democratic Gibraltars of the State, had
                    promptly filled their quotas to the last man by a regiment of volunteers from
                    their own people, was regarded as fatal to Republican mastery in the city.</p>
<p>Colonel Mann was a candidate for re-election as district attorney, and was the
                    undisputed political leader. The Union League was not then completely organized,
                    and it was not felt in the effort to reinforce the army as it was later in its
                    magnificent movements by which regiment after regiment was raised and hurried to
                    the front.</p>
<p>There were experienced "lightning calculators" in those days, and they were
                    assigned the task of showing that Philadelphia had sent an excess of her quota
                    in volunteers to the front, and on one basis it was susceptible of the clearest
                    demonstration. Philadelphia had sent in companies and regiments marching from
                    the city to the field many more than her full quota, but several thousand of
                    them were men who had come from adjoining counties to join companies in the
                    city, all of whom had been credited to their proper districts at home. Armed
                    with this plausible balance sheet, a formidable political committee was sent to
                    Washington to wrestle ostensibly with the Provost Marshal General, but in fact
                    with the political leaders who had access to the citadel of power. They insisted
                    that they had  filled their full quota, and that to compel them to
                    send additional troops would be very unjust and result in political disaster.</p>
<p>The result was that I received official instructions from Washington to revise
                    the quota of Philadelphia and revoke the order for the draft. I doubt not that
                    the political leaders were entirely right in the assumption that a draft in
                    Philadelphia would have assured Republican defeat, as the Republican majority in
                    the city was only 2,500. The political situation was thus saved in Philadelphia,
                    but the army lost nearly 3,000 reinforcements.</p>
