                <p>These reminiscences were written by request for a young lady who read them at a
                    meeting pf the Daughters of the Confederacy in Waynesboro, <abbr
                        expan="Virginia">Va.</abbr>:</p>
                <p>Now it is the Daughters of the Confederacy; then it was the mothers, sisters, and
                    sweethearts of the South who gathered to see their sons, brothers, and lovers
                    off to the war. What a thrilling time it was in that spring of 1861 when a
                    "nation was born" and a most glorious chapter in human bearing and daring was
                    written! The Southern Confederacy, that inspiration of cavaliers and
                    righteousness, that inspirer of heroes, who pricked their names on the pages of
                    history with sword and bayonet point; of poets, who "wreathed around with glory"
                    the Southern cross; of matrons and maidens, who gave more than life to its
                    defense!</p>
                <p>Then began the assemblign of that Southern manhood and boyhood who were to go
                    "sounding down the ages" as the Confederate army. Among the first to enroll
                    themselves under its banner were the Valley Rangers, a voluntary cavalry company
                    composed of the very best of the young men living along the eastern side of
                    Augusta County, who under their first captain, the brave Patrick (who later as
                    major of the Seventeenth Battalion was to die gloriously on the plains of Second
                    Manassas), met in historic Waynesboro to go to the front. It was then the comedy
                    parts in the great opening drama commenced. How exercised we were about our
                    uniforms, how we had to send off for the material, and get just the right shade
                    of color, and the exact buttons, braid, etc.! How we watched the making of them
                    and how impatient we got; and, at length, when finished and donned, how we did
                    strut, and how gorgeous we were with our wide yellow (the cavalry color) striped
                    trousers and braided coats and bright brass buttons (a gross of them, more or
                    less); and our hats, great wide-brimmed slouches, with plume and gilt cord and
                    tassel; and what a sight was the little fellow in his overlarge clothes! My eye;
                    but it was comic, and our pictures would grace the Sunday newspaper of to-day.
                    Then, at last, when everythign was ready, our horses, the very finest and best
                    in the county, groomed to perfection, with plaited manes and tails; new saddles,
                    with bright red blankets and girths; our big, old-fashioned saddle pockets
                    stuffed to bulging with every useful article; and then the baggage wagon to
                    follow with our trunks, bedding, etc., enough for an army in later days. And the
                    joke of it all was, that not one in ten had a weapon of any kind unless it was a
                    toy pistol or so. And to think of such a going to war! But then, the guns we
                    would, and did, get later from the enemy. How vividly the scene comes back of
                    our last mustering! How we formed in line on Main Street, and, as we mounted our
                    horses for the last time, of the motherly caress and cautions, the father's
                    advice, the sister's proud smile, and the admiring looks of the younger brothers
                    and servants; and then, the sly embrace of the sweetheart behind the parlor
                    door, when we rushed in to say good-by for the twentieth time! Last came the
                    presentation of our flag and farewell address from our good and true "Old
                    Parson" Richardson.</p>
                <p>The from our captain came, "Attention, company! By two, march! Head of column
                    right!" and away we marched for Harper's Ferry to fight Yankees, and without a
                    gun. (Pure comedy that, with no chance for a tragedy.) What an enjoyable march
                    it was! To usboys it was as when school closed and we reveled in the sense of
                    freedom and dreamed of the great and daring deeds we should perform. The march
                    down the valley in that lovely April was enjoyed ever so much. How we laughed
                    and chatted by the way, and now and then tried the speed and mettle of our
                    horses, and how we were cheered and admired by the girls all along the route!
                    And the great event, our arrival at Harper's Ferry, where was forming that grand
                    army that later, as the Army of Northern Virginia, was for the coming four years
                    to perform the deeds of heroism that make it the honor it now is to be a
                    Daughter of the Confederacy! Camp life was a revelation and delight to the boys
                    who had been so strictly reared at home, and we threw ourselves into and enjoyed
                    it to the full. How we smoked, played cards, frolicked, tussled, and let
                    ourselves out in gay abandon! O, but it was jolly!</p>
                <p>Pretty soon our camp at the Ferry was broken up, and the war began in earnest.
                    Then our company-now known as Company E, First Virginia Cavalry-made the first
                    fight in the Valley by a skirmish with a lot of Yankees across the Potomac at
                    Williamsport, and in a few days we had our first man shot-Sam Dalhouse-and then
                    we fought alogn with the West Augusta Guard of Staunton and the Rockbridge
                    Artillery and the other troops under Jackson (the building Stonewall Brigade) at
                    Falling Waters, and under J. E. B. Stuart, our major then and afterwards our
                    great cavalry general. We captured the very first company of Yankees and had one
                    of our company-Zach Johnson-wounded. Both Johnson and Dalhouse died in a few
                    months, partly from their wounds. It was in this fight at Falling Waters that
                        <abbr expan="Major">Maj.</abbr> D. W. Drake and <abbr expan="Captain"
                    >Capt.</abbr> John Opie, then privates in the West Augusta Guards, being a
                    little in advance of our line of battle and intent on firing at the Yankees, did
                    not notice the withdrawal of their command, but continued shooting, and thus
                    those two brave boys held in check the Yankee Gen. Patterson's army for a while,
                    and then fell back in good order and without a scratch. Both of these boys
                    afterwards performed many deeds of bravery besides the holding in check of an
                    army. But it was not all tragedy; and when the fight was over, then came the
                    camp with its pleasures of good comradeship and fun, and thus we got the
                    variety-tragedy and comedy; that was the spice of our soldier life. It was not
                    often we saw our sweethearts or any other fellow's sweetheart, but just now and
                    then we would camp near some nice girls and would have the time and cheek to
                    make their acquaintance. So it happened to us one time down in Culpeper County.
                    We camped for a month near the homes of several charming girls, and fortunately
                    "one of ours" (Drake) knew them, so our mess "had the call" on that house, and
                    we went in for all the fun and good eatings possible. We had music and dinners
                    and suppers whenever we could get away from camp. And just then we got a "box
                    from home," and concluded to set up a big dinner to our girl friends as a return
                    for the many we had from them. So with much care and concern we fixed up a table
                    with some old plank, and covered it with an oilcloth for a table cover, and had
                    stumps for seats. Now, every mess had in it one who was supposed to be a boss
                    cook. Ours was James E. Irvine, the best of comrades and soldiers. So to "old
                    Jim" was <orig reg="entrusted">intrusted</orig> the making of the coffee and the
                    spread generally, whilst we courting boys rode gayly away to fetch our girls on
                    behind us into camp, and how delightful was that ride! How we would spur our
                    horses, making them cut up, so the girl on behind would hold on to us ever so
                    clingingly, as it is their nature. O my; but the fun of that and our entry into
                    camp! How the boys would pass by our mess, at a distance, just to get a glance
                    at the girls, and others would, from behind trees, take long and wistful looks
                    at the strange beings. O, those boxes from home, what delights they were both in
                    giving and receiving! How care-<pb n="352"/>fully were their contents selected!
                    The best of everything at home was for the soldier boys. And then, how the boys
                    enjoyed them, and how unselfish they were calling in their friends to the feast!
                    At last dinner was announced. First came the ham (it was the best in the
                    smokehouse), boiled and then roasted to a turn at home, with its spots of black
                    pepper, the "piece irresitible." Then the sausage, so nicely fried by Jim, with
                    its brown gravy, the cold tongue, the jar of pickle, the nice butter, the
                    home-made cheese, apple and peach butter, a glass of jelly; then the cakes,
                    sugar, ginger, doughnuts, and the great fruit cake, a little coffee, ready
                    ground and perhaps the last they had at home, and the sugar, salt, and pepper,
                    and the long black bottle of rare old grape wine we had found down in one corner
                    of our box-just "in case of sickness," you know. Everything fit to make a feast
                    for the gods of war. But the goddesses were there too, and so Venus feasted with
                    Mars, and everythign was Elysium. What a feast it was, spread in that woodland
                    camp of the First Virginia, in advance of the Army of Northern Virginia! With
                    the danger line only a few miles away, we needed no other spice to incite
                    enjoyment of the present, for who more than the careless and gay "Confed" could
                    take in every passing pleasure and bit of humor, even when going into a fight?
                    Yes; it was with us as in our camp song:<lb/> "Then let the big guns rattle as
                    they will,<lb/> We'll be gay and happy still."<lb/> So we made ourselves gay and
                    festive at that dinner, and gave the girls a jolly good time and a bright bit of
                    camp life, not knowing or caring for the morrow.</p>
                <p>Dinner over, we got permission fromt he ladies and enjoyed our pipes as usual;
                    then later we had a song or two, just to let the other boys "hear an angel sing"
                    once again. And then, again taking our lovely guests up behind us on our
                    prancing steeds, we returned them in safety to their homes. That was the comedy.
                    Afterwards came the tragedy, when a few days later our bugles sounded boots and
                    saddles, and we heard the Yankee cavalry had crossed the Rappahannock, captured
                    our pickets, and were advancing on our camp. "The there was mounting in haste."
                    We soon were ready and riding rapidly to meet them. The ladies, our late guests,
                    lived in the direction of our march, so our party rode over to say good-by; and
                    it was with a sigh and a tear, but brave words, they bade us farewell, and
                    perhaps forever. And it turned out, though we did not get killed, that we never
                    saw our sweet girls again. We met the Yankees and fought one of our historic
                    battles of Kelley's Ford, March 17, 1863, and we drove them back across the
                    river, and thus opened the campaign of 1863, in which was fought
                    Chancellorsville. So it was we lived our soldier life, from grave to gay and gay
                    to grave, and as time passed the fighting was more frequent, and there was more
                    of tragedy and less of comedy, for after each fight some gay spirit of fun would
                    be missing from around a camp fire. Yet those who were left got all the
                    pleasures possible out of life, and without any disrespect for the missing
                    comrade we kept up the fun and frolic to the end. And to some of the survivors
                    those were the four gayest and jolliest years of life.</p>
