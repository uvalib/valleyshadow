                <p>Virginia Division, <abbr expan="United Daughters of the Confederacy">U. D.
                    C.</abbr>, sends hearty greetings to sister Divisions and wishes for each of
                    them a most prosperous and successful new year.</p>
                <p>Albemarle Chapter, <abbr expan="Number">No.</abbr> I, is waxing warm and
                    enthusiastic over establishing a memorial fund "from the dead to the living
                    veterans." Hearty responses have been made to the appeal. A plan is now on foot
                    to organize an auxiliary Chapter.</p>
                <p>J. E. B. Stuart Chapter, of Staunton, has placed handsome Virginia State flags
                    over the two public schools. It has now ordered its third flag for the Deaf and
                    Blind Institute, located at Staunton. This is one of the most flourishing and
                    wide-awake Chapters in our Division.</p>
                <p>I have the great privilege and pleasure of announcing that Virginia won the
                    Raines banner, offered by the <abbr expan="United Daughters of the Confederacy"
                        >U. D. C.</abbr> for the best historical work last year. By the efforts of
                    Mrs. J. E. Alexander a new Chapter, known as Welby Carter Chapter, has been
                    organized at Upperville, with Mrs. Sophie Carter Richardson as President.</p>
                <p>On November 1, 1915, a most enthusiastic gathering met at the beautiful home of
                    Mrs. Ogle Taylor, at King George Courthouse, and formed the King George Chapter,
                    with twenty-four members, Mrs. Frank Taylor being made President. Much interest
                    was manifested, and we have every reason to hope for a flourishing Chapter
                    there.</p>
                <p>Another new Chapter was organized at Fredericksburg, with thirty-six charter
                    members, taking for its name Marye's Heights Chapter, electing Mrs. John T.
                    Goolrick President.</p>
                <p>The fourth new Chapter was formed December 3, 1915, drawing its members from
                    Tinkling Springs, Stuart's Draft, and Fisherville. The name C. R. Mason was
                    adopted, thus paying a just tribute to the great hero of the Confederate war,
                    Jackson's bridge builder. It was through his wonderful ingenuity in this respect
                    that General Jackson was enabled to make those forced marches which immortalized
                    his name.</p>
                <p>The junior auxiliaries in our Division are becoming an important factor. To these
                    junior Chapters is offered a flag, the last flag of the Confederacy, to the
                    Chapter formed this year having the greatest number of members; and to the one
                    doing the best historical work, a State flag.</p>
                <p>The annual Grand Camp of Confederate Veterans of Virginia met in Fredericksburg
                    this year. One of the most pleasing features of the reunion was the trip to the
                    different battle fields - Chancellorsville, Wilderness, Todd's Tavern, Bloody
                    Angle, and Spottsylvania Courthouse. A marker was placed and dedicated at the
                    old home of Commodore Matthew Fontaine Maury during the reunion. A brilliant
                    reception and many other entertainments were given under the auspices of the
                    Fredericksburg Chapter, Daughters of the Confederacy. The parade was a long and
                    interesting line, Veterans, Sons, Daughters, sponsors, maids, and school
                    children taking part. The reunion closed with praise for the splendid
                    hospitality and patriotism displayed by the city of Fredericksburg.</p>
