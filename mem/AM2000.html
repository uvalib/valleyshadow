<h3 class="section-head">Augusta: "A Prisoner's March from Gettysburg to Staunton," by John L.
                            Collins, 1888</h3>
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> John L. Collins of the 8th Pennsylvania Cavalry details his account of being a
                    Confederate prisoner in this article from Volume III of Battles and Leaders of
                    the Civil War. Captured at the Battle of Gettysburg, Collins was marched to
                    Staunton, Virginia, at times being guarded by the Staunton Artillery. Collins
                    writes of his opinion of both the Staunton Artillery and the city of
                Staunton.</p>
<p>ON the 4th, when Lee's movement of withdrawal became known, the cavalry was
                    ordered to throw itself between the Confederate army and the Potomac. To do this
                    the different divisions were headed for the gaps and passes through which the
                    trains sent under escort in advance were escaping over the mountains to
                    Williamsport.</p>
<p>The regiment to which I belonged was in Gregg's division, but having become
                    detached with the rest of the brigade during the three days of the battle, it
                    united with two other brigades under General Kilpatrick and made an attack upon
                    a Confederate train near Monterey. The fight took place before midnight the
                    first day of the march, the train was burned, the guard was made prisoners, and
                    then our command pushed on after another train that was reported ahead of the
                    one we destroyed. A few whose horses [who] were killed or disabled were ordered
                    back to the division for a remount, instead of being mounted upon the enemy's
                    horses. I disobeyed the orders, and hoping to get one of the enemy's horses I
                    led my own and followed on foot. I soon lost sight of the brigade, however, but
                    toiled along the dark and rough road, until my horse, which at first could walk
                    with only the weight of the saddle, refused to go any farther. As the day was
                    breaking, I was examining and washing the poor creature's wounded shoulder, when
                    I was surprised by about 150 Confederate cavalry, whose approach I had hailed as
                    that of friends. At a motion from their colonel three men dismounted, the
                    foremost of whom held out his hand to me and cheerfully said: "Good morning,
                    sir! I am  sorry to say you are a prisoner." The other two went
                    toward my arms, which were piled on the saddle on the roadside, and, holding
                    them up, exclaimed, "What splendid arms he has!" Surprise and the novelty of the
                    first man's greeting kept me from realizing my position until I saw them take my
                    carbine, saber, and pistol. Then my heart sank.</p>
<p>Those "splendid arms" had been my companions for two years, and two months
                    previously I had been publicly commended for bringing them with me through the
                    enemy's ranks when my horse was shot inside their lines as we charged upon
                    Jackson's men at Chancellorsville. But such is war, and I bade them a sorrowful
                    adieu, as I looked from them to the faces of my captors, some of which showed
                    sympathy, some indifference, while all seemed manly and soldierly. The commander
                    alone took no notice of me or my arms; he gazed up the road through the gray
                    light of the morning as if bent on some bold manoeuvre, and then said to one of his men in a loud voice: "Tell
                    General Lee (Fitzhugh) that there is a regiment of Yankee cavalry half a mile up
                    the road, and ask him if I shall charge them."</p>
<p>The man galloped back, and without waiting for General Lee's orders, the colonel
                    wheeled his men and galloped after him, -- such a piece of cheap braggadocio as
                    I had seen displayed by some of our own colonels. I was left in the care of two
                    men to put the saddle on my horse and follow at a walk. My guards were frank,
                    and in answer to my question told me that they belonged to General William E.
                    Jones's brigade, that they had been captured in the fight just mentioned, and
                    had escaped during the night from Kilpatrick who was more intent in overtaking
                    larger bodies than in watching the few hundred he had taken. Between midnight
                    and daybreak the colonel and about 150 men came together in the woods and fell
                    in with General Fitzhugh Lee, who was then slipping out between two divisions of
                    our cavalry.</p>
<p>About noon I was introduced to about thirty of those who had been sent back for
                    horses to the division, and had shared my fate. We were with General Stuart's
                    headquarters, as he was moving in the center of his brigades -- they being
                    pushed out in every direction, trying to keep a road clear for their infantry
                    and artillery.</p>
<p>A young Virginian about my own age, but with much more suavity and
                    self-complacency than I could claim, introduced himself to me and told me that
                    he belonged to the "King and Queen" cavalry (1st Virginia, I think), and said
                    that they knew my regiment well, and considered it a "rough one to deal with."
                    He asked me if I remembered all the skirmishes we had as we advanced from New
                    Kent Court House to the Chickahominy, which I did well, and then when we had
                    become quite well acquainted, asked me if I would have any objections to
                    exchanging saddles with him. I had not the least, as I never expected to sit on
                    mine again, and when we stopped on the roadside to make the exchange I walked
                    back into the ranks without my horse, as I saw no reason why I should bother
                    leading him along for my captors to ride, if he should ever get well. Fresh
                    prisoners were added all the time, mostly cavalry, and we marched along through
                    the mountains the entire day, Stuart and his staff rode in our midst -- rather
                    an imprudent thing, I thought, for many of the men observed him closely with
                    reference to a future meeting. I know it was in my mind every time I looked at
                    him, though I had no malice and nothing to complain of in regard to my
                    treatment. Within a year he fell by the carbine of a cavalry-man whose regiment
                    was at this time well represented among the prisoners.</p>
<p>The day was a hard one for me, used to fatigue and fasting though I was. The
                    roads were the roughest and narrowest that could be found, and I had eaten
                    nothing since the previous day, having lost my haversack during the night. I was
                    at last compelled to tell one of the guards that I was very hungry, and he
                    apologized for having nothing to give me, but promised to see that I got
                    something before we went much farther. He left the ranks soon and shortly
                    afterward returned with some bread and butter, which he divided with me. Later
                    in the afternoon foragers brought us in rations collected from the farm-houses.</p>
<p>Just before sunset, as we were going through a gap, a rapid exchange of shots was
                    heard ahead of us, and both prisoners and captors became excited. A few moments
                    later we were near enough to look out into the plain beyond; we saw the
                    Confederates in front of us dismounting and deploying as skirmishers, and my
                    heart bounded as I saw my own regiment drawn up for a charge about five hundred
                    yards away! I began to cry like a child; I thought that I would be free again in
                    about ten minutes, with my friends; that I would be armed and mounted as
                    twenty-four hours before. The question, How did I know my regiment? naturally
                    comes, and is as easily answered. I could distinguish the companies by the color
                    of their horses, and knew the order of the squadrons in the line. The black
                    horses of troop C and the light bays of H formed the first squadron, the sorrel
                    horses of E and the dark bays of G formed the next, and so on. The troops
                    changed squadron often to suit the seniority of the captains, and the squadrons
                    changed positions in the regiment for the same reason, but the combination of
                    companies before me now had been that of the regiment for a week at least.</p>
<p>A call was made for sharp-shooters, and those who dismounted and presented
                    themselves were supplied with cartridges and sent into the cornfield in front of
                    us. But my regiment seemed disinclined to charge, and merely threw out
                    skirmishers to meet them. Some of the Confederates enthusiastically cried, "My!
                    won't the sharp-shooters make it hot for that cavalry!"</p>
<p>Though the firing became brisk, it wearied me; I wanted the charge, because I was
                    sure that a vigorous attack would send our guards fleeing without us in less
                    than five minutes. One of them, a quiet, pleasant-faced man, as were many of the
                    others, noticed my dejected look, came to me, and, swinging himself from his
                    saddle to a fence-rail,  took a Testament from his pocket, and
                    asked me if I objected to his reading a chapter aloud. I thankfully asked him to
                    do so, as I had not had heart enough to read my own that day. He read a chapter
                    in one of Paul's epistles, and when he had concluded remarked that he would feel
                    fifty per cent. better if the country were at peace and he at home that night. I
                    must add that while he was reading I held Quaker principles myself, for I was
                    pained to think I was an enemy of that fair-minded Christian young man who, like
                    myself, thought he was right in engaging in a career of destruction to life and
                    property. But we were both reminded that it was war and not peace by the call of
                    "More ammunition" for the sharp-shooters, and our guards had to supply it from
                    their boxes, it being apparently scarce.</p>
<p>Now is the time for a charge, I thought. General Stuart had not more than three
                    hundred men, encumbered by as many prisoners, and the regiment in front had five
                    hundred in line. But while their commander hesitated, General Stuart, whose
                    genius and courage had gotten him out of many a difficulty, proved himself equal
                    to the present emergency. While his skirmishers were firing their last
                    cartridges he made us fall in by fours, and marched us two or three times across
                    the opening. We were mistaken in the twilight for Confederate infantry coming
                    up, and then his whole column was moved along the edge of the corn-field,
                    keeping the skirmishers between us and my regiment, which moved parallel with
                    us, until darkness shut them out from my view.</p>
<p>The next morning Stuart's men were gone, and we were guarded toward the Potomac
                    by Pickett's division. I regretted the change, the rank and file of the cavalry
                    were so different from what I had expected to find the Southern soldiers. They
                    were quiet, courteous, and considerate; they all seemed young, of light build
                    with fair or sandy complexions predominant; and, better than all, they had more
                    by far than the average share of intelligence. The infantry that took their
                    place were nearer my conception of the Southern soldier. But I must not blame
                    the poor fellows if they had not the kindness and elasticity of the cavalry.
                    They were out of heart -- a large part of their division had been left on the
                    field on the 3d of July, and besides the commander of the division there was
                    only one officer above the rank of captain left in it.</p>
<p>We were halted by the roadside often during the day to let Confederate troops
                    hurry past us. In one of these halts General Longstreet was pointed out to me
                    with evident pride by a staff-officer who had turned aside to make some
                    courteous remarks to me. I told the officer as politely as I could that I
                    thought they were badly beaten, and would hardly get across the Potomac. He
                    laughed and said that they were not trying to get across, -- that Baltimore was
                    their objective point just then; from there, he explained, it was but a forced
                    march to Washington, and once there they could conquer a peace in thirty days.
                    His hopes amused me; I remembered that when retreating from the Chickahominy and
                    from Chancellorsville I did not know anything of defeat, but thought I was
                    marching to victory by another road.</p>
<p>The next time we were halted I was not so pleasantly entertained. I sat on a high
                    bank watching the various regiments and batteries go by, when a haughty young
                    officer rode up, looking at the prisoners' feet, as if he wanted a pair of
                    boots. Several of the men concealed theirs by drawing them up, but I did not;
                    the soles of mine were coming off, for two days' march over rough roads was
                    something the contractor for cavalry boots had not contemplated. The officer
                    pulled up in front of me, however, and said in an overbearing manner, "I want
                    those spurs." I merely looked at them and nodded. "Hand them to me," he said
                    sternly. "They were given to me for the United States service, not for rebel
                    service," I said, stung by his manner. "Oh!" he scornfully remarked, "I suppose
                    you know you are a prisoner?" "Yes, I have been nearly two days without food;
                    that convinces me." "And when a soldier is taken, his horse, his arms, and
                    equipments are his captor's?" "Yes, mine are all gone." "And his spurs, too?"
                    "Yes, and his boots sometimes." "Hand me your spurs, then." "Take them, if you
                    want them, I won't hand them to you." He took out his pistol and raised it, but
                    controlling himself lowered it and moved away. Then he turned his horse and
                    demanded them again. The same answer, and the same arguments were repeated; the
                    pistol was pointed at me, but his soldierly qualities triumphed over his temper
                    as before. There seemed no way out of the difficulty; he was determined to have
                    the spurs, but too proud to dismount and unbuckle them, and I was too stubborn
                    to yield. At last one of Pickett's men came up and took them off, and the
                    officer rode away with them.</p>
<p>Before I left the spot I kicked off my boots, for they seemed made only to carry
                    spurs, and went barefoot the rest of the way to Richmond. The prisoners who on
                    the first day had numbered only about 300, mostly cavalry, were now increased to
                    nearly as many thousands, as the men taken at Gettysburg were added to us.
                    Besides these, fresh cavalry prisoners were brought in every day. From them we
                    heard of the extent of the victory, and the fighting that was still in progress,
                    and we were assured by them that neither we nor our guards could ever reach the
                    Potomac. This helped to restore the self-respect that a soldier partly loses
                    when his arms are taken from him, and which continued captivity almost entirely
                    destroys.</p>
<p>We were marched past a handsome house which had attracted our attention on our
                    way to Gettysburg by the number of United States flags and the gayly dressed ladies waving handkerchiefs to us. They were waving
                    them as boldly to the Confederates now, and the stars and stripes had been
                    transformed into the stars and bars.</p>
<p>Some of the newly captured were badly wounded, but had no attention given them,
                    except such crude service as their fellow-prisoners could do for them. None of
                    our surgeons were captured, and I suppose those of the enemy had plenty to do
                    among their own. One poor fellow of the 5th New York Cavalry had seventeen
                    wounds which he got from the 11th Virginia. He was cut and slashed at every
                    angle,  and when we had gotten some bandages and patched him up he
                    looked ludicrously odd. Before we entered Williamsport a correspondent, whom the
                    Confederates had decided to let go, took the names of those who chose to give
                    them to him, that their friends might learn their fate from the papers. I gave
                    him mine, and though it was printed in a leading Philadelphia paper, I was
                    afterward mortified to learn that only one of all my friends in that city had
                    seen it. A dozen others there with whom I had correspondence supposed I had been
                    killed.</p>
<p>At Williamsport all was crowded and in confusion. The Confederates were throwing
                    up weak defenses in expectation of an attack. Our cavalry had cut their way in
                    and destroyed the only bridge that Lee had left in his rear. Some of the poor
                    fellows that must always get left on such occasions cheered us by telling us how
                    they did it. Three regiments charged in, -- one fought to the right, another to
                    the left, while the third, supplied with straw and turpentine, dashed at the
                    bridge, set fire to it, then cut it loose from its moorings and let it float
                    down the river, a burning wreck. "Score another for the cavalry," we cried.</p>
<p>My hopes rose with the river, which was a seething flood, boiling over its banks;
                    it seemed impossible to get us across the Potomac now. Rigging up a rope ferry,
                    and getting the prisoners across on flat-boats was the work of two or three
                    days, and then they encamped us on a hill a few days more, waiting for their
                    army to follow. I think they feared an advance by Harper's Ferry and
                    Martinsburg. The cavalry and flying artillery came from that direction;
                    Imboden's men told us so, and I never gave up hope until we had passed
                    Winchester. A brigade composed of infantry, cavalry, and artillery under General
                    Imboden guarded us from this point to Staunton, a distance of over 120 miles, I
                    think. It seemed five hundred miles to me, for I was barefooted and the pike had
                    been recently repaired.</p>
<p>The mode of marching us was now for the first time systematic. We numbered at
                    least four thousand men, and were divided into divisions, marching by columns of
                    fours. The cavalry and artillery marched en masse between the divisions, while
                    the infantry marched in two files, one at each side of the column. Imboden's
                    brigade did not seem to have seen much hard service, at least I thought so
                    because their clothes were new, yet the general had a new suit of gray on, and
                    certainly he had seen plenty of hard service. The men were as kind to us as
                    could be expected; only one unpleasant affair came under my observation all the
                    way. In the heat of a discussion a guard clubbed his musket and struck a wounded
                    man on the head. I have no doubt that the latter had his tongue to blame for it;
                    but he was a prisoner and a wounded man, and the guard was promptly placed under
                    arrest.</p>
<p>I have said nothing so far of the commissary arrangements simply because there
                    was nothing to be said. I do not now remember getting anything to eat until we
                    crossed the Potomac, except from Stuart's cavalry the fast day of my captivity.
                    But my memory must fail me, for I could not have lived unless I had gotten
                    something occasionally. After we left Williamsport the arrangements were regular
                    -- in their meagerness, too regular. We got about a pint of flour every other
                    day, and with it now and then a piece of rusty flitch. Some of the men tried to
                    make bread of the flour as we camped, but the greater number stirred it up in
                    water, and drank the paste, saying that "it stuck to their ribs longer" that
                    way. We got an extra ration at Martinsburg, that, out of compliment to the
                    ladies, I ought not to forget. As we marched through the town the whole populace
                    turned out to greet us, not as enemies but as friends and sympathizers. They
                    cried out to us, to cheer up -- not to be downhearted -- that we had won a great
                    victory at Gettysburg, and though we were being marched to prison we were
                    already avenged by the thousands of rebels that were left dead or prisoners in
                    Pennsylvania. They appeared to be well posted by the Northern newspapers, and
                    right in the teeth of the guards they upbraided the Confederates for theft and
                    violence north of the Potomac. It must have been very galling to Imboden's
                    command to be reviled that way by their countrywomen, but they bore it with
                    cast-down heads, and made no reply. We could not have done it, I fear, had we
                    been the guards, and in Pennsylvania. At last some of our men, in reply to
                    questions on the subject, said they did not give us anything to eat. There was a
                    sudden rush for the houses, and in a few seconds the street was lined with women
                    with dishes of cake, bread, and everything they could lay hands on with so short
                    a notice.</p>
<p>The sight of the food threw our column into disorder. Some men tried to break out
                    of the ranks, and this being resisted, the women tried to break in. In the
                    confusion that followed a few women were pushed back to the street-curb and fell
                    down. The falls were, I think, accidental; but the prisoners became furious when
                    they saw them fall, they struck at the guards right and left, and overpowered
                    many of them, bearing them to the ground. It looked for the moment as if there
                    would be a general fight, which must result in the death of many prisoners and
                    the escape of others; but this was prevented by the prompt action of the cavalry
                    and artillery, marching near the scene of the revolt. Then the general, or some
                    one for him, promised the people and the prisoners that the latter would be
                    halted outside the town to receive the contributions. In an open wood by the
                    roadside we were halted, and the guards themselves soon brought us the coveted
                    food. The sly rascals must have tossed the dainties up in the blankets as they
                    brought them along so that every man of us at a single grab could get a sample
                    of all they sent. I got one good handful only, but it was a mixture of
                    ginger-bread, cookies, cake, cornbread, and everything else that the people of
                    Martinsburg ate. It was here that the Barbara Frietchies lived. After the battle
                    of Antietam these women had laid planks on a torn up bridge for us, so that we
                    could cross and drive Stuart's cavalry out of the town.</p>
<p>But notwithstanding this extra food at Martinsburg the low diet and the sharp
                    stones soon told  my strength. My feet were sore, and my stomach
                    was faint beyond endurance, and the climax was reached one day when my sight
                    left me, and I threw myself down on the roadside to die. The rallying cry of "A
                    cavalry charge" had no more effect on me; I knew they could not approach us now,
                    and I gave up in despair as soon as I found I was blind. The guards tried to
                    make me get up, but I listened with indifference to their threats shoot me. The
                    rear-guard of each division passed me with the same result for their efforts
                    rouse me, until at last the rear-guard of all came up; the officer in command
                    assured me that was his duty to kill me rather than leave me behind, and though
                    I believed him I could not move, and merely told him so. At last he told a man
                    to "run me through" with his bayonet, but I suppose there was a saving sign that
                    I did not see, for after a pause I heard him tell the man to stay with me until
                    a wagon came along and I could be taken and given something to eat. I never saw
                    that officer, but I hope God saw his act of forbearance and humanity and
                    rewarded him for it. There have been miserable cowards in either army who
                    bullied and mistreated unfortunate prisoners when they had the power to do so,
                    but the true soldier never did, and I never saw anything but kindness shown to
                    the prisoners that regiment took, and I never experienced anything but kindness
                    from the men who guarded me from Gettysburg to Staunton.</p>
<p>After a long rest I was placed in a wagon and taken to a house where I got a big
                    slice of bread and butter, and in a short time sight and strength returned, and
                    I was able to march with the column. I ought to add for my own credit that I did
                    fall out again, though faint and hungry often enough. The towns through which we
                    passed on our way up the Shenandoah Valley were apprised of our coming, and
                    manifested a different spirit, of course, from that exhibited at Martinsburg.
                    Many insulted and upbraided us, but some of our men who excelled in nothing else
                    were mighty in vituperation and abusive eloquence, and these paid back with
                    interest all the taunts we received, often, I am sorry to say, surpassing the
                    bounds of self-respect and decency.</p>
<p>We usually encamped in large meadows, through which streams of good water ran,
                    and were here allowed to wash, eat, and sleep while our guards were posted
                    around the fences. At one of those halts, as we approached Staunton, a farmer
                    with his wife drove up close to the fence, and after taking a critical survey of
                    the crowd he said indignantly: "Forty thousand Yankee prisoners! Why, I would
                    bet the best farm in the valley that there isn't a quarter of them here!"</p>
<p>The heralds everywhere had doubtless added a harmless cipher to our real number.</p>
<p>At length -- about the 20th of July, I think -- we arrived at Staunton, weary and
                    sore. We had marched about fifteen miles a day since we left Williamsport. As we
                    entered Staunton some showed their love to their enemies by supplying us with
                    tracts, but I am not sure that their kindness was appreciated by the prisoners
                    as generally as was the attention paid to our hungry stomachs by the people of
                    Martinsburg. While waiting there for transportation to Richmond we were amused
                    to note the esteem in which the people held the Confederate money. Those who
                    brought wares into our camp for sale at first refused to sell at all except for
                    Federal money. When the officers threatened to expel from the camp any who did
                    that, they would ask to see the money before naming the price, and if it was
                    Federal, the pie was a quarter, but if Confederate, it would cost a dollar. One
                    young army sharper -- not one of our guards and not a Virginian -- must have
                    made a small fortune by exchanging money with our men at the rate of about two
                    for one. He told them that at Richmond the respective values were even, but when
                    we were marched through that city we found it to be as ten to one.</p>
<p>Our marches ended here; we were placed in box, or gravel cars, and at a slightly
                    increased rate of speed were taken to Richmond.</p>
