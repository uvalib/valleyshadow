                            Burning of Chambersburg," by Jubal Early, 1867</h3>
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> In a chapter from his book, Jubal A. Early describes the Confederate reasoning
                    and planning that culminated in the burning of Chambersburg.</p>
<p>On the 26th we moved to Martinsburg, the cavalry going to the Potomac. The 27th
                    and 28th were employed in destroying the railroad, it having been repaired since
                    we passed over it at the beginning of the month. While at Martinsburg, it was
                    ascertained, beyond all doubt, that Hunter had been again indulging in his
                    favourite [sic] mode of warfare, and that, after his [begin page 67] return to
                    the Valley, while we were near Washington, among other outrages, the private
                    residences of Mr. Andrew Hunter, a member of the Virginia Senate, Mr. Alexander
                    R. Boteler, an ex-member of the Confederate Congress, as well as of the United
                    States Congress, and Edmund I. Lee, a distant relative of General Lee, all in
                    Jefferson County, with their contents, had been burned by his orders, only time
                    enough being given for the ladies to get out of the houses. A number of towns in
                    the South, as well as private country houses, had been burned by the Federal
                    troops, and the accounts had been heralded forth in some of the Northern papers
                    in terms of exultation, and gloated over by their readers, while they were
                    received with apathy by others. I now came to the conclusion that we had stood
                    this mode of warfare long enough, and that it was time to open the eyes of the
                    people of the North to its enormity, by an example in the way of retaliation. I
                    did not select the cases mentioned, as having more merit or greater claims for
                    retaliation than others, but because they had occurred within the limits of the
                    country covered by my command, and were brought more immediately to my
                    attention.</p>
<p>The town of Chambersburg in Pennsylvania was selected as the one on which
                    retaliation should be made, and McCausland was ordered to proceed with his
                    brigade and that of Johnson and a battery of artillery to that place, and demand
                    of the municipal authorities the sum of $100,000 in gold, or $50,000 in United
                    States currency, as a compensation for the destruction of the houses named and
                    their contents; and, in default of payment, to lay the town in ashes, in
                    retaliation for the [begin page 68] burning of those houses and others in
                    Virginia, as well as for the towns which had been burned in other Southern
                    States. A written demand to that effect was sent to the municipal authorities,
                    and they were informed what would be the result of a failure or refusal to
                    comply with it. I desired to give the people of Chambersburg an opportunity of
                    saving their town, by making compensation for part of the injury done, and hoped
                    that the payment of such a sum would have the desired effect, and open the eyes
                    of the people of other towns at the North, to the necessity of urging upon their
                    government the adoption of a different policy. McCausland was also directed to
                    proceed from Chambersburg towards Cumberland in Maryland, and levy contributions
                    in money upon that and other towns able to bear them, and if possible destroy
                    the machinery at the coal pits near Cumberland, and the machine shops, depots,
                    and bridges on the Baltimore and Ohio railroad as far as practicable.</p>
<p>On the 29th, McCansland crossed the Potomac near Clear Spring, above
                    Williamsport, and I moved with Rodes' and' Ramseur's divisions and Vaughan's
                    cavalry to the latter place, while Imboden demonstrated with his and Jackson's
                    cavalry towards Harper's Ferry, in order to withdraw attention from McCausland.
                    Breckenridge remained at Martinsburg and continued the destruction of the
                    railroad. Vaughan drove a force of cavalry from Williamsport, and went into
                    Hagerstown, where he captured and destroyed a train of cars loaded with
                    supplies. One of Rodes' brigades was crossed over at Wi1liamsport and
                    subsequently withdrawn. On the 30th, McCausland being well, under way, I moved
                    back to Martinsburg, and on the 31st the whole infantry force was moved to
                    Bunker Hill, where we remained on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd of August.</p>
<p>On the 4th, in order to enable McCausland to retire from Pennsylvania and
                    Maryland, and to keep Hunter, who had been reinforced by the 6th and 19th Corps,
                    and had been oscillating between Harper's Ferry and Monocacy Junction, in a
                    state of uncertainty, I again moved to the Potomac with the infantry and
                    Vaughan's and Jackson's cavalry, while Imboden demonstrated towards Harper's
                    Ferry. On the 5th Rodes' and [begin page 68] Ramseur's divisions crossed at
                    Williamsport and took position near St. James' College, and Vaughan's cavalry
                    went into Hagerstown. Breckenridge, with his command, and Jackson's cavalry,
                    crossed at Shepherdstown, and took position at Sharpsburg. This position is in
                    full view from Maryland. Heights, and a cavalry force was sent out by the enemy
                    to reconnoitre, [sic] which, after skirmishing with Jackson's cavalry, was
                    driven off by the sharpshooters of Gordon's division. On the 6th, the whole
                    force recrossed [sic] the Potomac at Williamsport, and moved towards
                    Martinsburg; and on the 7th we returned to Bunker Hill. [begin page 70]</p>
<p>On the 30th of July McCausland reached Chambersburg, and made the demand as
                    directed, reading to such of the authorities as presented themselves the paper
                    sent by me. The demand was not complied with, the people stating that they were
                    not afraid of having their town burned, and that a Federal force was
                    approaching. The policy pursued by our army on former occasions had been so
                    lenient, that they did not suppose the threat was in earnest this time, and they
                    hoped for speedy relief. McCausland, however, proceeded to carry out his orders,
                    and the greater part of the town was laid in ashes. He then moved in the
                    direction of Cumberland, but, on approaching that town, he found it defended by
                    a force under Kelly too strong for him to attack, and he withdrew towards
                    Hampshire County in Virginia, and crossed the Potomac near the mouth of the
                    South Branch, capturing the garrison at that place and partially destroying the
                    railroad bridge. He then invested the post on the railroad at New Creek, but.
                    finding it too strongly fortified to take by assault, he moved to Moorefield in
                    Hardy County, near which dace he halted to rest and recruit his men and horses,
                    as the command was now considered safe from pursuit. Averill, however, had been
                    pursuing from Chambersburg with a body of cavalry, and Johnson's brigade was
                    surprised in camp, before day, on the morning of the 7th of August, and routed
                    by Averill's force. This resulted also in the rout of McCausland's brigade, and
                    the loss of the artillery (4 pieces) and about 300 prisoners from the whole
                    command. The balance of the command made its way to Mount Jackson in great
                    disorder, and much weakened. This affair had a very damaging effect upon my
                    cavalry for the rest of the campaign.</p>
