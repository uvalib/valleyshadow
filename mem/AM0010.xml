                <p>[Captain Bouldin is a well-known member of the Virginia Bar, and has contributed
                    to past volumes of this serial.-<abbr expan="Editor">ED.</abbr>]</p>
                <p>In his address to the veterans and "daughters" here Thursday night, Captain
                    Morton, their Inspector General, referred to the battle flag of the 14th
                    Virginia Cavalry, which is among those returned by the Government. Yankee <abbr
                        expan="Sergeant">Sgt.</abbr>, J. Donalson, Company L., 4th Pennsylvania
                    Cavalry, who had turned over the old war worn banner to the United States
                    Government, claimed that he captured it on the 9th of April at Appomattox and
                    pinned a paper on the flag to that effect, which was found by Captain Morton,
                    when he took the flags out of their care for exhibition in the Capitol. The
                    interesting local feature about the flag is that it was Captain E. E. Bouldin's
                    regimental flag, and he says it was not captured, but picked up after the
                    color-bearer, James Wilson, was killed and the regiment left the field. There
                    was no capture at all. This statement was vouched for by two letters produced by
                    Captain Morton, one to him by <abbr expan="Sergeant">Sgt.</abbr>, J. Scott
                    Moore, of Lexington, <abbr expan="Virginia">Va.</abbr>, and the other by W. L.
                    Moffett, of Augusta County, <abbr expan="Virginia">Va.</abbr>, in a very
                    interesting letter to Captain Bouldin, which was referred to by the speaker and
                    is reproduced here:</p>
                <p>Steels' Tavern, Augusta <abbr expan="County">Co.</abbr>, <abbr expan="Virginia"
                        >Va.</abbr><lb/> April 6th, 1899.</p>

                <p>Dear Sir,-I note your letter in the Rockbridge News of recent date, asking
                    members of the 14th <abbr expan="Virginia">Va.</abbr> Cavalry, to write <pb
                        n="14"/> you at Danville what they remember of the last charge of the 14th
                    at Appomattox <abbr expan="Court House">C. H.</abbr></p>
                <p>The ever memorable day of the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia by <abbr
                        expan="General">Gen.</abbr> R. E. Lee, to <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr>
                    U. S. Grant. Let us go back in the history of the regiment for a time.***</p>
                <p>After a few days the retreat from Petersburg and Richmond was commenced, the
                    battles of Butterwood Creek and Dinwiddie <abbr expan="Court House">C.
                    H.</abbr>, and Five Forks, and they were hot and we had it all the way to
                    Appomattox <abbr expan="Court House">C. H.</abbr>-skirmish, picket, scout-with
                    very little to eat and no forage for our horses, scarcely. It was an awful
                    retreat. Yankees, by the thousand, after us, and on our flanks. The day and
                    night before we reached Appomattox-we were covering the retreat of Lee's
                    Army-about ten or eleven o'clock the bugle sounded "Mount your horses," and we
                    passed the whole of our army to the front and formed into line of battle, were
                    dismounted and ordered to stand and hold horses and keep awake. You were in
                    command, having joined the regiment a few days before from Camp <orig
                        reg="Chase">Chose</orig>, Ohio, where you went the previous July from
                    Morefield, without your own consent. You never will forget Morefield, will you?
                    I won't.</p>
                <p>Just as the daylight was dawning a shell from our front shrieked over our heads,
                    and to mount was sounded by our bugler. At the same time <abbr expan="Colonel"
                        >Col.</abbr> W. T. Poague's regiment of artillery just to our left opened
                    (he told me afterwards) sixteen guns on the woods in our front and the shells
                    passed over our heads, as we went by fours down the little slope towards the
                    hill from where the shell had come that started us. As I now remember we went
                    slow at first, then at a trot and as Poague's guns ceased firing we charged the
                    woods and captured the battery, four brass howitzers, and horses and men. The
                    battery belonged at Philadelphia, and was a light battery with a cavalry brigade
                    that had reached our front. We captured a lot of prisoners in the charge and
                    brought them out. I was ordered to guard them fellows, and when I got rid of
                    them, the regiment had gone somewhere, I did not know where. But I did know I
                    was left with some yankees, and could only see the dust you all were making to
                    my right and to the yankee's left. General W. H. F. Lee came along my way as I
                    stood with the prisoners, and I asked him where the command was. He answered me:
                    "It has gone; <pb n="15"/> you turn them fellows aloose and come with me," and I
                    came. As I looked over my shoulders, as I went down the hill we had charged up,
                    I saw a regiment of Yanks riding by front of line with their carbines slung, and
                    carrying a white flag in the middle of the regiment and gradually expanding
                    around our camp. The battery we had captured was moving back towards their
                    lines, and one fellow said to me as they passed, "Guess you did not keep us very
                    long, Johnny, did you." I followed General Lee down and back the way we came and
                    found Generals R. E. Lee and Gordon and Pendleton and Pickett and Longstreet at
                    the apple tree where General W. H. F. Lee joined his father, and I was told it
                    was all over.</p>
                <p>There I was; not a 14th man to be seen, and I felt like I was in a strange land,
                    hungry. Pretty soon Captain Bill Smith who had as you may remember been in
                    charge of the picket line, the night before, and we had not been relieved where
                    we came from rear to front of Lee's army up to me and said: "Moffett, where is
                    the regiment: what are you doing here," all in the same breath, to which I
                    answered "I don't know, do you?" "They say we have surrendered," he said. I
                    said, "Well I am not going to surrender." Just then <abbr expan="General"
                    >Gen.</abbr> R. E. Lee, passed near us and Smith said to him, "General, what is
                    the matter? I am not going to surrender; can't I leave here?" <abbr
                        expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Lee said, "I have surrendered this army; I
                    cannot give you permission to leave, and captain you ought not to leave; stay
                    with the rest of us." But Bill Smith said, "I am going to get out of here or
                    die, and he did leave and got out and lives to this day, the same brave, daring
                    and every inch a man. He was at the regiment as I came back with those
                    prisoners. I came by where Sam Walker was lying wounded in charge of John
                    Whitmore who said he was mortally wounded. He died that evening. Near him was
                    James Wilson, our color sergeant, and he too, poor fellow, had seen his last on
                    earth. His beautiful bay mare stood near him, and the colors of our old regiment
                    were furled and leaning against a tree never again to be unfurled. I do not
                    remember who was with him, but I think it was his brother. I knew he was dying;
                    my heart sunk within me when he said to me, "Moffett, it is hard to die now just
                    as the war is over. But it was his <pb n="16"/> fate. I think the colors fell
                    into the hands of the enemy, as I never heard of them afterward.</p>
                <p>In due time those of us who were left got home, many and many changes since the
                    surrender that Sunday morning, April 10, 1865. But those who were there will
                    never forget it and never ought to. Then after the dark days of reconstruction
                    we must be good fellows down South to have stood it all. But we did, and when
                    the next war came our Fitzhugh Lee and Wheeler and a host of others joined the
                    lines again to fight for the flag we fought from 1861 to 1865.</p>
                <p>Yours truly,</p>
