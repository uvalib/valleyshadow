                </p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, Comrades of the 77th: It is as much a matter of regret to
                    me as it can possibly be to you, that the gentleman first selected to deliver
                    this address could not perform that duty. With considerable experience as a
                    public speaker and being possessed of more than ordinary ability, I doubt not
                    any effort on his part would have met your expectations more fully that I hope
                    to do.-Not knowing till within the last few days that Col. Pyfer would not be here, and that I was to take his place, my
                    opportunities for preparation have not been as great as I could have desired. I
                    shall give you what few points of interest and such thoughts as I have been able
                    to call together, within this very limited space of time, asking you to pardon
                    me anything that, to you, may seem amiss.</p>
<p>On the 12th day of April, 1861, that fearful civil war, which had for so many
                    months been portending, unclasped its purple leaves at Sumpter. Dark as were the clouds which in these months had hung over
                    our country's Southern horizon, our people were as yet unprepared for the shock
                    of battle. Though fearful, they had not actually believed until then that the
                    differences, which ambitious men and designing politicians had created between
                    sections, were to be wiped out in blood. The immediate causes of the war, I
                    shall not attempt to discuss at all to-day. Suffice it
                    for the occasion to say that it came upon us in the shape of a war between the
                    two great sections of the country-the North and the South. -Whatever may have
                    been the opinions of parties here in the North prior to that time, it was almost
                    unanimously agreed upon after the bombardment of Sumpter, that the rebellion should be quelled. The Flag of our Union had
                    been assailed, and from every section of the North there went up the cry "To
                    Arms." Companies and Regiments were speedily formed. States vied with one
                    another in their haste to succor the cause of our imperilled country.
                    Pennsylvania, true to her instincts and true to her own proud position as the
                    "Keystone of the Federal arch," proved herself first among the foremost in this
                    patriotic work. She sent forth regiment after regiment of brave, gallant
                    fellows, and in October, 1861, nine years ago she sent the 77th. I know I will
                    be pardoned when I say that of all the regiments she sent forth there was no
                    braver and better one, than this, whose surviving representatives are met here
                        to-day, to renew the associations of the years of
                    arduous, dangerous service through which they have passed. Briefly as possible
                    let its history speak for itself. On the 1st day of August, 1861, Col. Stumbaugh, who presides here to-day, received authority from the department of war to recruit the
                    regiment. A camp of rendezvous was first established at this place, which was
                    afterwards transferred to Pittsburgh, when the regiment was mustered for service
                    on the 11th of October. On the 18th of October it was transported to Louisville,
                    by way of the Ohio river; thence to Nolin's river, where it encamped for several
                    weeks. Here it was assigned to General Buell's army, and participated with it in
                    the advance on Nashville. From Nashville it advanced in the direction of
                    Savannah, Tenn., where the division to which it
                    belonged-General M'Cooks', arrived on the night of the 6th of April, 1862. Its
                    march that day was hurried on by the booming of cannon ahead, which told plainly
                    enough that a battle was raging somewhere along the line of the Tennessee river.
                    Arrived at Savannah, the news came to us that General Grant and his forces, were
                    in sore peril on the field of Shiloh.-Part of Buell's forces reached the scene
                    of action that evening and the remainder were hurried forward during the night
                    through a most pittiless and pelting storm. The 77th
                    arrived on the field of conflict at 8 o'clock on the morning of the 7th.
                    Although not warmly engaged, it was brought under fire several times during the
                    day. The loss of the regiment in the fight was 3 killed and 7 wounded. It was
                    the only Pennsylvania regiment engaged in that battle.</p>
<p>After Shiloh it participated in the siege of Corinth; then in that long,
                    wearisome race between Bragg and Buell to Louisville. It was at Stone River when
                    that battle began, and to a member of the 77th belongs the honor of firing the
                    first shot in the fight. All day long on the 31st of December, it was engaged,
                    and lost heavily. Many of its bravest men were killed and wounded and some of
                    its best officers. It was there that Col. Housum
                    fell at the head of the regiment. Brave gallant fellow, he met the stern
                    messenger of death with that same coolness and inflexible courage which had
                    characterized every other act of his life. I speak no words of superfluous
                    praise here to-day when I say that he was one of the
                    most honorable of men, one of the best of commanders, and one of the bravest of
                    soldiers. Over his grave, in yonder cemetery, stands a monument erected by his
                    men whose simple inscription tells the whole story of his career as a soldier.
                    "Davis, I am wounded; stay by the brave boys of the 77th," were the last words
                    he uttered, after having been struck down by the fatal missile of death. The
                    77th did its duty at Stone River well and no stronger proof of the fact is
                    needed than the words of General Rosecrans, uttered while reviewing the regiment
                    after the battle. He said, "Col., I see your
                    regiment is all right. Give my compliments to the boys and tell them I say it
                    was the banner regiment at Stone River. <u>They never broke
                        their ranks.</u>" After several months spent in camp at Murfreesboro
                    during which it was engaged in building fortifications at that point, the
                    regiment moved South again with the army; was at Liberty Cap on the 25th of
                    June, 1863, and, although the battle there lasted but ten minutes, our loss in
                    killed and wounded was fifty. Time will not permit me to follow up closely the
                    history of the regiment, all its skirmishes marches and countermarches. I only
                    touch upon points of greatest importance. After many long and tiresome marches,
                    the regiment again came face to face with the enemy at Chicamauga, on the 19th of September 1863. That was its most
                    terrible struggle. Entering the battle with 18 officers and 215 men, it came out
                    with but 6 officers and scarcely fifty men.-Few of all those faces which were
                    missing from the ranks after the battle closed were ever seen there again. Some
                    killed, some wounded and others taken to vile and torturous prison pens where
                    life ebbed slowly, but surely away. By myself nothing is more clearly remembered
                    than the conflict there on the night of the 19th. It was the most fearful scene
                    I have ever witnessed. The heavens were dark and cloudy, and the air through the
                    woods in which our men fought was murky with the smoke of the battle. The
                    conflict was hand to hand, and it was only by the light of flashing muskets that
                    friend could be distinguished from foe. Our colors were taken, but only when the
                    brave fellow who bore them was pinned to the earth by a rebel bayonet. We were
                    two regiments to a whole division, and they bore us down with an overpowering
                    force. I could speak of many acts of individual bravery there that night, but
                    where all acted so well, it would be unfair to make any distinction. By Col. Housum's side their sleeps one who fell in that
                    fight.</p>
<p>From Chicamauga we follow the regiment back to
                    Chattanooga. But it is not a regiment now, save only in name. It is a mere
                    handful of men, scarcely half a company. After participating for a month in the
                    defence of Chattanooga the organization went into camp, at Whitesides, Tenn., where it remained until the close of 1863.
                    In January, 1864, most of its survivors re-enlisted and the regiment was sent
                    home. After remaining in the State a little over a month, and having recruited
                    many new members it again returned to the front in order to take part in the
                    Atlanta campaign. In that campaign which might justly be termed the hundred
                    miles and hundred days fight from Resaca to Atlanta, the regiment must have been
                    engaged twenty times, the most prominent of which engagements were Resaca,
                    Kingston, Cassville, Dallas, Kenesaw Mountains, Chattahoochie River, Peach Tree
                    Creek, Lovejoy, Jonesboro and Atlanta itself. In the latter engagement Capt. Walker, who had been wounded twice before, was
                    killed. Parting with Sherman when he began his march "From Atlanta to the Sea,"
                    the 77th followed the fortunes of the 4th army corps, to which it was then
                    attached, back through Georgia, through Northern Alabama and through middle
                    Tennessee, until on the 30th of November, 1864, it found itself facing Hood at
                    Franklin.</p>
<p>For the time it lasted, and the number of troops engaged on both sides, the
                    battle of Franklin was one of the bloodiest of the war.-Seven times in quick
                    succession did the united forces of Hood's army hurl themselves against the
                    temporary breast-work we had erected, each time to be driven back with fearful
                    slaughter. Never did men charge with more desperate courage than did the enemy
                    there that night, and never were charges more sternly met. At times the conflict
                    was hand to hand, bayonets, and even picks and spades, being used. Twenty days
                    after the battle I rode over the field and counted in one spot the graves of 13
                    officers, and over a 100 men of the 26th Tenn,
                    confederate regiment. They had been burried by kind
                    hands where they fell and their graves marked. As I afterwards learned from a
                    prisoner, the regiment was small when it entered the fight and came out with but
                    15 men and not a single officer. I mention this fact to show the severity of the
                    loss on the enemie's side. It was not quite as great
                    on our own, from the fact that we were protected by slight breast-works.
                    Retiring from Franklin under cover of night we fell back to Nashville, where on
                    the 15th and 16th of December our little army of scarcely two corps again met
                    Hood's forces in battle. In those two days we almost destroyed his army. But a
                    mere remnant, bleeding and torn, escaped back across the Tennessee River. That
                    was the last battle in which the 77th was engaged, and with it closed the war in
                    the West and South West.</p>
<p>Following the remnant of Hood's army as far as the Tennessee, our corps halted at
                    Huntsville, Ala., for a few weeks rest. On the 5th
                    day of March, 1865, we were transported to East Tennessee for the purpose of
                    joining in the last, grand, "On to Richmond." But ere we were ready for the
                    forward march "the last ditch" of the enemy was found and emptied by our boys in
                    the East. At Appomatox Court House, on the 8th day
                    of April, 1865, the head of that army which had struggled against us for four
                    long years, surrendered and the war was over. Southern valor had not proved
                    enough for Northern prowess. What a glad day that was, when the surrender of Lee
                    was echoed in one universal shout of "Peace." Peace was what the heart of the
                    nation had longed for. That four years of war had devastated our fairest fields
                    and brightest spots, it had taxed almost to the utmost the energies and
                    resources of the country, and sent more than a million of its best and bravest
                    in the spring and bloom of their lives to the dark shores of eternity. Oh! is it
                    to be wondered at, the hearts of all people had grown sick. With Lee's surrender
                    the war virtually closed, many regiments being soon after mustered out. Not so,
                    however, with the 77th. A few weeks before the surrender the regiment had been
                    reinforced by the addition of five new companies. These companies arrived too
                    late to take part in any engagement, but soon enough to see some hard service.
                    Having been reorganized and there being no further work for it in East
                    Tennessee, it was sent back to Nashville, where it lay until the 17th of June,
                    when it was ordered along with others to Texas. Starting from Johnsonville and
                    going by way of the Tennessee and Mississippi rivers, it arrived at New Orleans
                    on the 25th of June, when it encamped on the old Jackson battle ground, a place
                    called Chalmette.</p>
<p>On the 13th of July it embarked for Matagorda Bay, Texas, where it landed on the
                    20th. The trip across the Gulf was a stormy and dangerous one, so stormy in fact
                    that six days were spent in sight of the coast, without any attempt being made
                    at landing. The intervening time, from July the 20th till the 17th of the
                    following December, was spent in that far distant State. We were now three
                    thousand miles from home, and in an inhospitable clime. Many a gallant soldier,
                    who had braved the storms of battle, fell there in that far off land, a victim
                    of disease.</p>
<p>If my memory serves me aright, we lost 60 by death from fever alone. Leaving
                    Galveston on the 17th of December, the regiment returned home and was mustered
                    out of service on the 17th day of January, 1866. Among the first to enter, it
                    was the last to leave the service. Its terms of service covered a period of over
                    four years, during which it traveled over 20,000 miles, fought in more than 20
                    pitched battles and buried over 400 men. Such, comrades, is in part the history
                    our regiment has written for itself. Time has allowed me to give but a synopsis
                    of its doings, and that imperfectly. Enough has been spoken however to give some
                    idea of its record. Who will say the record is not one of which every member may
                    justly feel proud. Other regiments may have served as faithfully and as well,
                    but none better. I am glad it was my fortune to belong to it. I love to run back
                    in memory over the stirring scenes in which it participated. I love to recall
                    the faces of old comrades-some dead, others living. And it gives me pleasure to
                    meet so many of you here to-day, some of whom I have
                    not seen since at Philadelphia, we doffed the livery of soldiers, and donned the
                    dress of citizens. How pleasant to all of us is the reunion here to day. It is
                    like brothers long parted meeting together again, and are we not brothers?
                    Members for years of the same great family, eating from the same table, drinking
                    from the same fountains and streams, reposing together on the same fields,
                    companions in camp and on the march, comrades in battle, the tie that binds us
                    is almost as strong and dissoluble, as that which links together the hearts of
                    those, who in childhood's hour, knelt at the same parental knee. To myself there
                    are many very pleasant memories connected with my soldier life. As you know, all
                    was not hardship and danger. There were many really pleasant evenings spent
                    around the camp fires, when jokes were freely passed round and genial spirits
                    entertained their comrades in roars of laughter. There were those, we had them
                    in every company, whose love of fun and natural exhuberence of spirit, no amount of hardships could suppress. In the
                    camp, on the march, and even where great danger lurked, they were always in a
                    jolly mood. Such fellows were the life and soul of the army. Who of the older
                    members of the regiment, does not remember Neal Foy, of Co. A, always lively, always ready for a joke - no matter where it
                    was, whether in camp, or when the storm of battle was about to break over our
                    ranks. He was brave too, and never shirked a single duty. Poor fellow; he died
                    in Texas, just before our term of service closed. I wish I could stop to-day to pronounce a eulogy upon each one of our
                    cherished dead. I can think now of so many whose names are deserving of special
                    mention on this occasion-not officers alone, but private soldiers-men who
                    fought, not for promotion or for pay, but who went with hearts fired with
                    patriotic zeal went forth to find nameless graves. Poor fellows, this reunion
                    here to-day is not for them. Our festivities will carry
                    no enjoyment to the places where they are resting. It is meet therefore that we
                    should speak of them, if not by name at least in general terms. Let us worship a
                    moment at the shrine of their memories. They made the sacrifices so necessary to
                    bring back peace and unity to the country, and their great services will be
                    remembered long after our own have passed from the minds of men.<br> "A debt of
                    gratitude we owe-<br> To them is justly due-<br> And till our nation's latest
                    day,<br> Our children's children still shall say:<br> They died for me and
                    you."</p>
<p>There is another class worthy of mention on this occasion. They are those who
                    went forth full of the strength and vigor of manhood, and came back to us mere
                    shattered wrecks of their former selves. Although they are, to a certain extent,
                    objects of a nation's care, it seems to me as though some of them were unkindly
                    dealt with; in fact, I have seen more than one of them ruthlessly thrust aside
                    to make room for those who have no claim upon the patronage of the government,
                    or the sympathy of the people. This should not be. The man who laid a limb upon
                    the field of battle, or whose arm when raised in his country's behalf was torn
                    from its place, has provided he is in every way capable, a superior claim to
                    preferment in every walk of life-a claim which a grateful people and a grateful
                    country cannot consistently ignore. They bear the marks of honorable service and
                    should not be made to do menial labor. I confess to have blushed for my country
                    when I have seen one of her faithful defenders, a crippled almost helpless man,
                    grinding an organ on the streets for a living. Often when the plaintive notes of
                    his instrument have fallen on my ear, I have been reminded of poor, blind
                    Bellisarius, sitting before the gates of the capital he had saved, begging a
                    penny from the bands of charity. Why such sights are permitted is more than I
                    can understand. It is certainly a burning shame on us all. What if there be some
                    defect in his discharge papers? Red-tape officials should be made to overlook
                    mere irregularities on paper, when a man presents for a pension a certificate
                    written out by the enemies bullets on the field of battle.</p>
<p>Nor should I forget to-day, when there are so many fair
                    ones here, that there is still another class to whom the nation owes its meed of praise. Not of those who endured the danger and
                    fatigue of the camp and march, this class is still perhaps to be held in more
                    grateful recollection than any other. Unfitted for the bivouac of actual army
                    life, its silent watch was kept by the side of the dying. At home and in the
                    crowded hospital it found its work of devotion and love. All honor to them that
                    noble army of Christian women, which carried its ministration to the bedsides of
                    the suffering ones. Thousands this hour have reason to bless the name of some
                    one of these whose kindly hand had kept back the life which else had spent. Back
                    along the past we find many instances of the heroic devotion of women, but it
                    seems to have remained for our own great civil war, to develop the highest type
                    of nobility in her sex. Not in hospitals alone did her devotion to the cause
                    shine forth; she was active elsewhere; active in encouraging enlistments, active
                    in her efforts to buoy up the heart when despondency threatened. She suffered
                    too. Show me a wife who lost a husband, or a mother who lost a son in that war,
                    and I'll show you one who has suffered anguish greater than you and I have ever
                    known. Though uncomplaining, the pallor of her cheek and the lines upon her face
                    speak of a grief yet unassuaged. Even yet when I meet one of these, her wan, sad
                    face seems to me to be looking away off in the direction of those sunny hills,
                    and fragrant groves, where that one who was dearer to her than all else besides,
                    is taking his warrior's rest-looking anxiously as though the hope yet lingered
                    that he might yet come back to her side. Oh, my comrades and friends, if true
                    devotion is to be found anywhere, it is to be found in the hearts of such as
                    these. If there is hope for our country in the uncertain future, it rests on the
                    altars they have erected. Somebody has fitly remarked: "If woman be with us, who
                    can be against us; woman who was last at the Cross, and first at the Sepulcher."
                    To the crippled ones then, to the mother in her sorrow, to the widow in the
                        lonliness of her heart-to those in the tears
                    of orphanage, is due all of the gratitude we owe. Let our thanks and
                    benefactions be showered upon their heads. Give them all the praise. Those who
                    went forth, and returned again in safety, need it not; they ask it not. His must
                    be a craven heart indeed, who would expect it above any of these.</p>
<p>It may not be inappropriate to the occasion, my comrades, for me to allude to the
                    fact that our reunion occurs to-day in a place which
                    has suffered far more than the ordinary vicissitudes of war.</p>
<p>This temple of justice and these buildings for squares around are new. They stand
                    over the ashes of the houses and homes, which lined these streets when you were
                    marching down them to the seat of war, nine years ago. Many of you doubtless
                    remember the day (I remember it well) when the news was brought to the front
                    that Chambersburg had been burned. It was the 5th day of August 1864, just after
                    we had succeeded in fighting our way up to the environs of Atlanta. I remember
                    how deep the feeling of indignation which ran through our ranks, at the act; how
                    our boys vowed to one another that the foul crime should be avenged; and how
                    that very evening, when part of them had been called upon to charge the enemy,
                    they fought with an unwonted degree of valor. "Oh, if the 77th had only been
                    there," was the expression heard that day. Yes if the 77th had only been here, I
                    feel free to say the unholy work of burning would only have been accomplished
                    when the power to defend had been stricken from their arms. The history of the
                    burning must be in a manner familiar to you all. You will recollect that the
                    town was fired on the 30th day of July 1864, by about 3000 of the enemies
                    cavalry, under command of General McCausland. Our Southern border here was at
                    the time unprotected by any force of our own troops, and the natural defenders
                    of this people were absent fighting in the trenches of Virginia and Georgia. On
                    the 30th day of July there were those standing with us in front of the enemy
                    before Atlanta, whose aged parents here, unprotected and unable to protect
                    themselves, were fleeing before the flames which were wrapping up their homes
                    and all they possessed in the world. No defense could have been made against
                    this force of the enemy. There was spirit enough among those left behind to
                    defend, but not strength enough. It would be difficult indeed to estimate the
                    loss of our people here by that conflagration. It would certainly not fall short
                    of $3,000,000. In a single hour 266 families were robbed of their homes and
                    turned out upon the world to battle with penury. Not only homes were burned, but
                    all the conveniences and comforts which years of patient toil had placed
                    therein, clothing, furniture, books, cherished heir-looms-everything, was swept
                    away. I mention these facts, my comrades, because I do not want you to forget
                    them. I want you to remember that you have visited on this occasion a people who
                    have suffered far more than their proportion the losses of the late war. I make
                    bold to speak to you thus, because I know you have noble and generous hearts,
                    and will when you hear this people vilified and abused as they have been in the
                    past, rebuke the insulters whoever they may be.</p>
<p>Briefly, my comrades, I have traced the history of our regiment. In a feeble
                    manner, I have essayed to pay a tribute to the memory of our comrade dead, and
                    to the faithful services of others, who, though still living, are but wearing
                    out lives of sadness. I have spoken too of the peculiar sufferings of this
                    people you have come among to-day; so I am about to
                    leave the subject with you. The incidents I have related and the facts to which
                    I have referred are all history now.-We remember them and will remember them
                    while we live, and when the last one of us has obeyed the bugle call to another
                    world, the lids of the great volume in which they are written will stand open
                    for those who are to come after us.</p>
<p>My comrades, it may be permitted many of us who are assembled here to-day to meet together on a future occasion of this
                    kind, to talk over the familiar scenes of the past, but certainly not all of us.
                    The great world with its varied pursuits is drawing us apart.-These reunions
                    will be growing smaller from year to year and after a little while they will
                    cease forever. While the opportunity remains then to any one, let that one come
                    up to these reunions whenever they may be.-Let us not forget the old 77th, its
                    association and friendships, nor let us forget the cause which first called us
                    together, and made us the comrades we are. It was the cause of an imperilled
                    country. It was to save this union of States from the impending fate of
                    dissolution. True in the past, I know each one of you will be true in the
                    future; tried in the furnace of battle your country knows now of what stern
                    material you are made. She knows that in any just cause, she may rely on the
                    same strong arms and brave hearts, which had saved her in the hour of her
                    greatest peril. She may need you again. While I hope for her future, that it
                    will be great and glorious, I am not unmindful of the dangers which lie in the
                    path of her progress. Most of us have read the sad fate of other nationalities.
                    We have seen how the whole pathway of the world's history is literally strewn
                    with the wrecks of Empires and peoples; of generations and liberty; and it may
                    been in the Providence of God this country of ours is destined to follow in the
                    wake of those that have gone before. It if must be so, let the fault be none of
                    ours. Let it be known that we at least stood by the union of our fathers. They
                    made it; their best blood cemented it. It was good enough for them; it is good
                    enough for us, and it will be good enough for all those who are to come after
                    us. In order then that this Union may be perpetuated, let us strive to forget
                    the hatred and animosities engendered by the war. The Union cannot long exist if
                    bound together only by a paper tie called the Constitution. No, it needs a
                    stronger and far more enduring tie than that. It needs the firmly cemented
                    affections of the people of all the States. Though deep and wide the wounds may
                    be, heal them all up.</p>
<p>Let us take a lesson in this from the gallant dead of both sides. On every battle
                    field they sleep, "the grey and blue," almost in brotherly embrace, their
                    warfare over and forgotten. So let it be with ours. Let us join hearts and heads
                    again, and go forward to labor for the fulfillment of what I trust will be a
                    great destiny for our country.</p>
