<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> This Letter to the Editor recounts the author's introduction to the future
                    General Jeb Stuart. It casts him in a polite, energetic, and otherwise pleasant

                    <b>How He Played Sheriff in a Lawyer's Bedroom.</b>
                </p>
<p>To the Editor of the Dispatch:</p>
<p>After a long, and, perhaps, unnecessary hesitancy, I have concluded to give to
                    you and other friends an account of the manner in which I became acquainted with
                    him who was afterwards such a famous general of the Southern Confederacy.</p>
<p>When I was a member of the Richmond bar, the Supreme Court of Appeals had gotten
                    so far behind their docket that the Legislature made strenuous efforts to unclog
                    said docket. The special Court of Appeals, composed of the five senior judges
                    (by date of commission) of the circuit courts, had proved insufficient for that
                    necessary purpose; and there were established several ancillary district
                    appellate courts. That to which appeals from the Richmond Circuit had to be
                    taken was held in Williamsburg.</p>
<p>In or about the spring of 1854 (I think it was) I had to argue some cases in this
                    court in the old "Middle Plantation," and went thither for that purpose. But my
                    cases were set for particular days, and I did not go down until they were about
                    to be reached. So that when I arrived, the rooms at the hotel were so occupied
                    that my friend, Albert Southall, could receive me only by giving me a bed in his
                    large "omnibus" room, with the reserved right of filling the other two double
                    beds. On these terms, I took sole possession, with plenty of "elbow room."</p>
<p>One afternoon, just about dusk, and in a heavy shower, a neat, light carriage all
                    curtained up and drawn by two spirited horses, drove up to the hotel, and as
                    soon as the porter could open the door, three young gentlemen, with United
                    States army trappings, jumped out and ran into the office. I had seen them for a
                    few moments through the window of another apartment.</p>
<p>After supper, I retired to my room, to complete my preparations for the morrow.
                    The opponent whom I had to encounter was the late Mr. John Howard, of Richmond.
                    I was in bed, with a table, lamp, law-books, and manuscript notes by its side,
                    putting system into what was to be presented to the court, when in rushed the
                    three young soldiers, merrier than crickets, and I soon learned what a good time
                    they had been enjoying. They quickly disrobed, and all three got into the large
                    bed nearest my own, neither of them being willing to be off by himself. Then
                    they kept up the liveliest sort of chat, recounting, among other things, the
                    adventures of that evening, for in order to get as much as possible out of their
                    opportunity, they had made several visits. Having been a student of William and
                    Mary, and being acquainted with the society of the city, more of that part of
                    their conversation was understood than they supposed. There was, however,
                    nothing vulgar or improper in it. It was only very jolly, and at times rather
                    uproarious. Still, it was not particularly favorable to the logical sequence of
                    a legal argument. After they had "carried on" for some time, one of them spoke
                    up very pleasantly: "See here, fellows, we have had our fun long enough; we are
                    disturbing that gentleman over there; let us hush up and go to sleep." I
                    immediately thanked him for his politeness and told them to go on with their
                    sport, as I had nearly finished my work and could easily do the rest before the
                    session of the court. Moreover, I put out my lamp "and pitched in" with them,
                    and it was past midnight when quiet came to that "omnibus."</p>
<p>The next morning they left the room in good time for me to make my toilet alone.
                    After breakfast, seeing one of them in front of the hotel, I engaged him in a
                    chat, in which I learned that he had been over to Gloucester county to visit an
                    army friend, who had brought him to Williamsburg that he might proceed to
                    Richmond. My impression is that this friend was with him at West Point, though
                    he may not have been in the same class. Who the two companions were cannot be
                    recalled. I wish I could call upon my friend, General William B. Taliaferro, to
                    aid me, and am sorry I did not think of doing so before he was taken from us.</p>
<p>I knew, from his voice, that my interlocutor was the one who had played sheriff
                    in my behalf, by calling for "silence," but without "pain of imprisonment" last
                    night, and I learned that his name was Stuart. That name interested me and led
                    to some inquiries. I knew the Stuarts, of Staunton, and the Hon. A. H. H. Stuart was one of the trustees of the
                    Virginia Female Institute who had invited me to be the first principal of that
                    institution, of which, by the way, Mrs. Jeb. Stuart was, for years, the third.</p>
<p>As to his other connections, of whom he spoke of, Mr. William L. Pannill, of
                    Pittsylvania county, had sent two of his daughters to the Home School, in my
                    family, in Richmond, and I had visited him at his home, Chalk Level, where I met
                    his mother-in-law, Mrs. Banks. With these facts, I told him that I had a
                    surprise for him, and that he might know whether or not it was an agreeable one,
                    he must call and see my wife, who was his kinswoman, through the Pannills.
                    Before we separated, I gave him my Richmond address. He had to wait for his
                    stage, and I went to the court-house. But before he left he came to that place
                    to see me and bid me good-bye. He could easily have omitted that, but would not.</p>
<p>Whether he was at my house before my return from Williamsburg is not positively
                    recalled. But he was there repeatedly afterwards, and we all took a great fancy
                    to him. Once he brought with him to show me a leather halter, with a fixture for
                    very quick undoing, which he had invented and intended to patent. In explaining
                    it, he said that on the western frontier, where his service was to be with the
                    United States Cavalry, they were liable to sudden raids and surprises from
                    Indians, and a few seconds in mounting might be a matter of life or death. They
                    were compelled to fasten their horses, in order to he sure of having them at
                    hand, in case of an alarm, and that time was lost in untying them. He had,
                    therefore, exerted his ingenuity in trying to get a secure fastener that could
                    be loosened in the shortest possible time, and he had brought the result to show
                    me. Whether he ever patented it is not known, but might be ascertained from the
                    Patent Office. It might have been called "Stuart's lightning horse hitcher;" or,
                    perhaps, unhitcher, as  that was the important matter. He certainly
                    was a lightning cavalier.</p>
<p>What struck me in him, besides his gallant and genial courtesy, was his
                    professional esprit. He wanted to accomplish something useful and honorable to
                    his country and himself upon laudable principle. He did; but how different was
                    his grand career in arms from what he then anticipated!</p>
<p>General Joseph E. Johnston once said to me, in Abingdon, that "the lot of Polk,
                    Jackson, and Stuart was more fortunate than that of their survivors." They, at
                    least, escaped the horrors of the spurious peace of Appomattox.</p>
