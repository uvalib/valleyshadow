<h3 class="section-head">Franklin: "Chapter L. The Emancipation Proclamation.," by Alexander
                            K. McClure, 1905</h3>
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> McClure describes the difficulties which he overcame (with the help of Abraham
                    Lincoln) in order to muster Pennsylvania troops for the Union cause. He also
                    discusses his early opposition to the Emancipation Proclamation and describes
                    the political fallout of the Proclamation for Republications across the
                country.</p>
<p>AT the time the draft was made in October, 1862, there was a decidedly improved
                    loyal sentiment inspired in Pennsylvania, notwithstanding the disastrous defeat
                    the Republican party suffered at the October election, when the entire
                    Democratic State ticket was elected, with a majority of Democrats in the
                    congressional delegation.</p>
<p>The effect of the Altoona conference and the aggressive attitude assumed by the
                    loyal Governors of the North, demanding that our army should be made
                    overwhelming in numbers, inspired confidence that military success would be
                    achieved and the over-throw of the rebellion accomplished at an early day. The
                    response of the Pennsylvania conscripts was generally very prompt, and Camp
                    Curtin soon became thronged with an unorganized conscript mob. I was exceedingly
                    anxious to get the men into the service because I expected my labors to cease as
                    soon as they were mustered, but the military officers at Harrisburg who had
                    charge of the mustering seemed  to be much more interested in the
                    contractors who supplied the camp than in speedily reinforcing the army, and
                    when a thousand or more men were coming into camp each day the mustering officer
                    organized two companies a day. I called upon him and made an earnest appeal for
                    him to send off at least a regiment a day, as I would be able to supply him with
                    that number of men for two weeks or more, but he treated my appeal not only with
                    indifference but rather with contempt, and continued to muster but two companies
                    a day. The result was that in a few days I had a mob of five or six thousand
                    soldiers in camp without organization, restless and boisterous, and I
                    telegraphed Secretary Stanton urging him to send me a mustering officer.</p>
<p>A new officer appeared on the following day and mustered a regiment himself, but
                    the next morning he was relieved from duty and ordered elsewhere, by what
                    authority I never knew, and the mustering was again reduced to two companies a
                    day.</p>
<p>That process would have kept from five to ten thousand troops in camp for six
                    weeks or two months, and as they were presumably in my immediate custody until
                    they were mustered into the United States service, and as the government greatly
                    needed the troops at the front, I decided to make a direct appeal to President
                    Lincoln to have them promptly mustered.</p>
<p>I telegraphed the President that I would call upon him in Washington early the
                    next morning, and met him according to appointment. I told him that I had given
                    more than two months of labor, often day and night, and never less than fifteen
                    hours out of the twenty-four, without compensation, to make the draft successful
                    in Pennsylvania and furnish troops to the government; that there were then from
                    five to six  thousand troops in camp, and that they were
                    accumulating much more rapidly than they were being mustered. I assured him that
                    a regiment a day could be forwarded to the army from Harrisburg for two weeks or
                    more; that if he would order a mustering officer to hasten their organization
                    and forward them to the front, I would gladly remain until the work was
                    completed, but that if the mustering could not be hastened I would abandon the
                    work at once and go home.</p>
<p>Lincoln was much distressed at the Harrisburg situation. He knew that political
                    influences had chosen the military officers assigned to duty at Harrisburg, as
                    was common elsewhere throughout the State, and he knew that the summary removal
                    of an officer would probably cause offense in a quarter that might later do him
                    much harm. He said that the troops must be forwarded at once, and he would have
                    it done, but he said he thought he had a better way of doing it than to remove
                    any of the Harrisburg officers. I told him it mattered not how it was
                    accomplished so that the work could be completed, the government get the troops
                    and I relieved of further exacting and profitless labor. Without making any
                    explanation he rang the bell and ordered his messenger to summon the adjutant
                    general of the army. In a few minutes Adjutant General Thomas appeared, and the
                    President asked him what was the rank of the senior officer on duty at
                    Harrisburg. Adjutant General Thomas replied that he was a captain. The President
                    then instructed the adjutant general to bring him at once a commission for me as
                    assistant adjutant general of the United States volunteers with the rank of
                    major, and the adjutant general took his leave.</p>
<p>As soon as he had left the room I said to the President that I could not consent
                    to enter the military  service, as I was not used to military
                    orders, and could not comply with military regulations without serious
                    inconvenience to myself. To which he replied that I need not worry about that,
                    as he would have an order issued assigning me to report to Governor Curtin, that
                    the commission would make me the ranking officer and commandant at Harrisburg,
                    and he supposed that, being under Governor Curtin's orders, there would be no
                    greater restraint in the military service than if I were not in it. He assured
                    me also that no order would be issued assigning me to duty elsewhere, and that
                    as soon as my work was completed at Harrisburg, and I desired to retire from the
                    service, my resignation should be forwarded to him, and it would be promptly
                    accepted. He insisted that I should continue to hold the commission after the
                    troops were mustered until all the many complicated accounts relating to the
                    draft could be settled between the State and the National government. He
                    suggested that I should, on my return to Harrisburg, call upon the commandant
                    there to muster me into the service, and he certainly believed that there would
                    be no difficulty about having troops mustered thereafter.</p>
<p>I returned to Harrisburg the same evening, and the next morning requested the
                    commandant to call at my office in the Capitol. He naturally supposed that I had
                    taken the liberty to send for him to importune him further as to the mustering
                    of the troops, and he came into the office in the most supercilious way and
                    asked to know why I had sent for him. I handed him my commission, requesting him
                    to muster me into the military service, and also handed him the order assigning
                    me to duty at Harrisburg. His arrogant manner was at once transformed into
                    pitiable obsequiousness, and he mustered me into the service.</p>
<p>After being mustered, I said to him, in the mildest way I could command, that I
                    knew nothing about military regulations, and did not expect to interfere with
                    him in any of the routine duties, but that there must be a regiment of troops
                    mustered and forwarded to the army each day until Camp Curtin was empty. I told
                    him that so far as I was concerned I had no desire to be known as the military
                    commandant of the place, that I would wear no uniform nor attempt in any way to
                    exploit myself as a military officer, and indeed very few of those connected
                    with public affairs in Harrisburg ever knew that I was the commanding officer at
                    the Capital.</p>
<p>I never had occasion to summon the captain for either suggestion or orders, and I
                    do not recall that I ever had further conference with him. His duties outside of
                    mustering were never interfered with, and the people of Harrisburg generally
                    never knew that there was a change in the military commandant.</p>
<p>After the troops were all mustered and the regiments sent to the front, I found
                    that I had on hand another very complicated and difficult task-that of gathering
                    in, revising and tabulating the various accounts arising from the draft. It
                    required more than a month of energetic effort to get the claims in any sort of
                    shape, as they embraced the pay of the many hundreds of enumerators who had
                    enrolled the districts of the State, and the many different expenses incurred in
                    each county in making the draft, and after they were gotten into shape it
                    required several months to get them advanced in Washington to the point of
                    settlement.</p>
<p>The National departments were all overworked; the Treasury was in a condition
                    that required the Secretary to pay as sparingly as possible, and final
                    settlement was naturally delayed as long as possible.</p>
<p>After everything had been done that could be done beyond simply importuning the
                    government to make payment, I resigned the office of assistant adjutant general,
                    leaving to the proper State authorities the duty of finishing the work of
                    obtaining money from the government.</p>
<p>My commission was issued October 27, 1862, but ante-dated September 5, and my
                    resignation was accepted and I was discharged from the service February 27,
                    1863.</p>
<p>The political situation became very unpromising in 1862, not only because of the
                    failure to prosecute the war successfully, but also because of the Emancipation
                    Proclamation, for which the more conservative element of the Republican party in
                    the State was not prepared.</p>
<p>The preliminary proclamation was issued on the 22nd of September, 1862, and from
                    that day those who had intelligent understanding of the general political
                    conditions had little hope of carrying any of the debatable Northern States at
                    the fall election of that year.</p>
<p>The Republicans of New England and of the far West were fully up to the
                    high-water anti-slavery mark, and ready to sustain the destruction of slavery by
                    any practicable method.</p>
<p>While earnestly anti-slavery in conviction, I was very positive in opposition to
                    the Emancipation Proclamation, and it was the only question that I very
                    earnestly disputed with the President.</p>
<p>It was an open secret for some months before the proclamation was issued that an
                    emancipation policy in some form was inevitable, and I was thoroughly convinced
                    that the conservative Republican sentiment of the great Middle States would not
                    sustain it. I could not see how it was possible for the adminis- 
                    tration to prosecute the war with the great Middle States against it, and in all
                    of my visits to the President, when opportunity presented, I took occasion to
                    admonish him as to the peril of such a movement.</p>
<p>I looked at the greatest of all the questions ever presented to the ruler of the
                    Republic from the mere standpoint of political expediency, and I predicted that
                    an Emancipation Proclamation would defeat the administration in all the great
                    States of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana and Illinois.
                    Lincoln did not dispute the assumption that political disaster was possible, and
                    he was most carefully reticent as to any indication of his purpose.</p>
<p>I urged him to issue a military order as the constitutional commander of the
                    armies of the Union, declaring that every slave brought within the Union lines
                    should be forever free, and that slavery should be abolished in every rebellious
                    State when brought within the control of our military authority.</p>
<p>I stated, what was indisputable, that the mere proclamation would not liberate a
                    single slave, and that only by the success of the army could the proclamation be
                    made effective. Lincoln had given the subject most anxious thought, but withheld
                    his purpose from all, even the members of his cabinet, until he had decided to
                    act.</p>
<p>The political disaster that I predicted was more than fulfilled. New York and New
                    Jersey elected Democratic Governors, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana and Illinois
                    were carried by the Democrats, and all of these great Middle States sent
                    Democratic delegations to Congress, but the South was excluded from
                    representation and New England and the far West saved the House to the
                    Administration, and the Emancipation Proclamation, the sublimest act of any  American ruler, was sustained by Congress, and finally heartily
                    sustained by the people of the North.</p>
<p>Lincoln, in his careful consideration of the subject, admitted the force of
                    political expediency that forbade an Emancipation Proclamation, but he realized
                    the higher and holier duties of his position, and within a year thereafter I had
                    learned how grandly he had faced all the arguments of expediency to give to
                    human freedom its supreme achievement in the history of nations.</p>
<p>But for the extraordinary efforts made by the concerted action of the Governors
                    of the North, resulting from the Altoona conference, and the inspiration given
                    to the loyal cause by the retreat of Lee from Antietam, Pennsylvania would have
                    voted largely Democratic.</p>
<p>The Union State convention met in Pennsylvania long before the Emancipation
                    Proclamation was issued, but it was generally believed that the issue must be
                    met in that campaign. I attended the convention at Harrisburg as a delegate. It
                    was an unusually able and thoroughly representative body, but all were shadowed
                    with the cloud of defeat. The failure of the army, the enforcement of the draft,
                    that then made even the most loyal of our people shudder, as it indicated a want
                    of willingness on the part of the people to sustain the war, were important
                    factors in aid of the Democratic party. Thomas E. Cochran, who was about closing
                    a term as auditor general, and who was conspicuously fitted for the position
                    alike in integrity and qualifications, was unanimously nominated for
                    re-election, and Henry Souther, of Elk County, who was then serving as surveyor
                    general by appointment, was chosen without opposition as the candidate for that
                    office. Both were men of ripe experience in State affairs, having served with
                         conspicuous credit in the State senate, and the ticket had all
                    the strength that individual merit could give it. The platform of the convention
                    heartily sustained the administration and the vigorous prosecution of the war.</p>
<p>The Democrats nominated Isaac Slenker, of Union, for auditor general, who had
                    also served in the senate some years before, and James P. Barr, editor of the
                    Pittsburg "Post," and one of the ablest of the Democratic leaders in
                    Pennsylvania, for surveyor general.</p>
<p>The platform of the Democratic party was cautiously drawn to commend itself to
                    the Republicans who were doubting or despairing in regard to the war, but it
                    proclaimed absolute devotion to the Union of the States.</p>
<p>The Republicans thus started in the campaign fearfully handicapped at an election
                    where a whole delegation to Congress was to be chosen and the Legislature then
                    elected was to name a United States Senator.</p>
<p>After the Altoona conference there was some indication of the political tide
                    turning in favor of the Republicans, but it was not strong enough to enable them
                    to hold power in the State, and the Democratic State ticket was elected by about
                    4,000 majority.</p>
<p>The congressional delegation elected in 1860 contained seventeen Republicans,
                    exclusive of Hendrick B. Wright, of Luzerne, and Joseph Bailey, of Perry, who
                    were War Democrats, making nineteen of the twenty-five earnest supporters of the
                    war; but the new delegation elected in 1862 contained eleven Republicans and
                    thirteen Democrats.</p>
<p>Galusha A. Grow, speaker of the first War Congress, and who had been in Congress
                    for ten years, was defeated by Charles Dennis. He was in a new district composed
                    of Susquehanna and Luzerne instead  of his own district of
                    Susquehanna, Bradford and Wyoming, and he was overwhelmed by the Democratic vote
                    of Luzerne County.</p>
<p>The Dauphin district, one of the strongest Republican districts of the State, was
                    lost by 500, William H. Miller, of Dauphin, defeating John J. Patterson,
                    ex-State representative from Juniata. Edward MacPherson, who had been twice
                    elected in the Franklin district, was defeated by some 500 majority by General
                    A.H. Coffroth, of Somerset; Archibald MacAllister of Blair defeated Steele Blair
                    of the Blair district; and John L. Dawson, of Fayette, one of the ablest of the
                    Democratic leaders, carried Covode's district, defeating Andrew Stewart.</p>
<p>Of the Congressmen elected by the Democrats Joseph Bailey, of Perry, was an out
                    and out War Democrat, and James T. Hale, of Centre, was an Independent and
                    thoroughly loyal Republican, making the delegation practically about even on the
                    issue of supporting the administration.</p>
<p>The Democrats concentrated their efforts to a great extent upon the control of
                    the Legislature, and the Republicans left no available means unemployed to save
                    the house. They had the assured control of the senate, as the sweeping
                    Republican majorities of several years before had left the senate nearly
                    two-thirds Republican, but the Democrats were inspired by the confidence of
                    victory, and their organization was then very compact and under the most skilled
                    leadership. Every debatable legislative district was exhaustively contested by
                    both parties, and the Republicans were greatly humiliated when the final returns
                    presented a Democratic majority of one on joint ballot.</p>
<p>The Senate stood twenty-one Republicans to twelve Democrats, but the house had
                    fifty-five Democrats  to forty-five Republicans, giving the
                    Democrats the control of the house by ten majority and the United States
                    Senatorship by a single vote.</p>
<p>In several instances members of the house were lost by one of the two parties by
                    less than half a score of votes. In Perry County John Magee, Democrat,
                    afterwards member of Congress, was elected by majority over Amos Barnett,
                    Republican, who later served ten years as president judge in the district. Both
                    parties had so carefully watched the campaign in the closely-contested districts
                    that there was no reasonable prospect of a contest on either side, and all
                    quietly settled down to the fact that the Democrats had the Legislature and
                    would have the Senator.</p>
<p>When the smoke of the battle cleared away and it was ascertained that the
                    Republicans held control of the National House of Representatives,
                    notwithstanding the defection in the great Middle States, the Republicans were
                    very much encouraged for future battles, and the close of the year 1862 found
                    our people and State in very much better condition to support the war, after
                    having gone through many months of sore depression often verging on despair.</p>
