                            Imboden, January 12, 1876</h3>
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> This note from General Imboden explains the suffering at Andersonville prison as
                    largely unavoidable and shifts much blame to the Union's refusal to exchange
                    prisoners or otherwise relieve the suffering of the prisoners.</p>
<p>RICHMOND, VA., January 12th, 1876.<br> GENERAL D.
                    H. MAURY,<br><u>Chairman of the Executive Committee of the
                        Southern Historical Society:</u></p>
<p>General-At your request I cheerfully reduce to writing the facts stated by me in
                    our conversation this morning, for preservation in the archives of your society,
                    and as bearing upon a historical question-the treatment of prisoners during our
                    late civil war, which it seems certain politicians of the vindictive type in the
                    North, led by a Presidential aspirant, have deemed it essential to their party
                    success to thrust upon the country again in the beginning of this our centennial
                    year.</p>
<p>It is to be hoped that after a lapse of ten years since we of the South grounded
                    our arms, passion has so far yielded to patriotism, reason, and sentiments of a
                    common humanity in the minds and hearts of the great mass of intelligent people
                    at the North, that all the facts relating to the great struggle between the
                    States of the North and South may be calmly presented, if not for final decision
                    by this generation, at least to aid impartial mankind in the future to judge
                    correctly between the conquering and the vanquished parties to the contest; and
                    to fix the responsibility where it attaches, to the one side or the other, or to
                    both, for sufferings inflicted that were not necessarily incident to a state of
                    war between contending Christian powers.</p>
<p>I now proceed to give you a simple historical narrative of facts within my
                    personal knowledge, that I believe have never been published, although at the
                    request of Judge Robert Ould, of this city, who was the Confederate Commissioner
                    for the Exchange of Prisoners, I wrote them out in 1866, and furnished the MS. to a reporter of the New York <u>Herald</u>. But the statement never appeared in that
                    journal, for the reason assigned by the reporter, that the conductors of the
                        <u>Herald</u> deemed the time inopportune for such a
                    publication. My MS. was retained by them, and I
                    have never heard of it since.</p>
<p>It is perhaps proper to state how I came to be connected with the prison service
                    of the Confederate States. An almost fatal attack of typhoid fever, in the
                    summer and fall of 1864, so impaired my physical condition that I was incapable
                    of performing efficiently the arduous duties of my position as a cavalry officer
                    on active service in the mountains of Virginia, and therefore I applied to the
                         Confederate War Office for assignment to some light duty
                    farther south till the milder weather of the ensuing spring would enable me to
                    take my place at the head of the brave and hardy mountaineers of the Valley and
                    western counties of Virginia I had the honor to command. General R. E. Lee
                    kindly urged my application in person, and procured an order directing me to
                    report to Brigadier-General J.H. Winder, then Commissary of Prisoners, whose
                    headquarters were at Columbia, South Carolina. I left my camp in the Shenandoah
                    Valley late in December, 1864, and reached Columbia, I think, on the 6th of
                    January, 1865. General Winder immediately ordered me to the command of all the
                    prisons west of the Savannah river, with leave to establish my temporary
                    headquarters at Aiken, South Carolina on account of the salubrity of its
                    climate. I cannot fix dates after this with absolute precision, because all my
                    official papers fell into the hands of the United States military authorities
                    after the surrender of General Joseph E. Johnston to General Sherman; but for
                    all essential purposes my memory enables me to detail events in consecutive
                    order, and approximately to assign each to its proper date.</p>
<p>A few days after receiving my orders from General Winder, I reached Aiken, and
                    visited Augusta, Georgia, and established an office there in charge of a staff
                    officer, Lieutenant George W. McPhail, for prompt and convenient communication
                    with the prisons of the department.</p>
<p>About my first official act was to dispatch Lieutenant-Colonel Bondurant on a
                    tour of inspection of the prisons in my department, with instructions to report
                    fully on their condition and management. Whilst Colonel Bondurant was on this
                    service, I was forced to quit Aiken by the approach of Kilpatrick's cavalry,
                    moving on the flank of Sherman's army. A detachment of this cavalry reached
                    Aiken within four hours after I left it. I then made Augusta my permanent
                    headquarters, residing, however, a few miles out on the Georgia railroad at
                    Berzelia. Colonel Bondurant promptly discharged the duty assigned to him, and on
                    the state of facts presented in his reports, I resolved to keep up but two
                    prisons, the one at Andersonville and the other at Eufaula. I did this for
                    economical reasons, and because it was easier to supply two posts than four or
                    five so widely scattered; and besides the whole number of prisoners in the
                    department then did not exceed 8,000 or 9,000 - the great majority, about 7,500,
                    being at Andersonville.</p>
<p>Before I received Colonel Bondurant's report, General Winder died, when, having
                    no superior in command, I reported directly to the Secretary of War at Richmond.
                    Communication with the War Office was at that period very slow and difficult.
                    Great military operations were in progress. General Sherman was moving through
                    the Carolinas. The Federal cavalry under Kilpatrick with Sherman and Stoneman
                    co-operating from Tennessee, almost suspended mail facilities between Georgia
                    and Virginia, and the telegraph was almost impracticable, because the line was
                    taxed almost to its  capacity in connection with active military
                    operations. After the death of General Winder, I made repeated efforts to
                    establish communication with the Secretary of War, and with Commissioner Ould,
                    and obtain some instructions in regard to the prisons and prisoners under my
                    charge. All these efforts failed, at least I received no reply by wire, mail or
                    messenger to any of my inquiries. A newspaper fell into my hands in which, as an
                    item of news, I saw it stated that Brigadier-General Gideon J. Pillow had been
                    appointed General Winder's successor. General Pillow was then at Macon, but had
                    received no official notification of his appointment, and I having none, could
                    not, and did not, recognize him as entitled to command me, but cheerfully, as
                    will appear further on, consulted him in regard to all important matters of
                    administration.</p>
<p>Colonel Bondurant's report on the Andersonville prison, taken in connection with
                    written applications from Captain Wirz which I had received, suggesting measures
                    for the amelioration of the condition of the prisoners, strongly endorsed and
                    approved by Colonel Gibbs, an old United States army officer, a cultivated,
                    urbane and humane gentleman, commanding the post, made it apparent to my mind
                    that I ought to make a personal examination into its condition. This was no easy
                    undertaking, as I had to travel over almost impassible country roads through the
                    desolated belt of country traversed by Sherman's army, in its march through
                    Georgia, for a distance of over seventy miles, before I could reach a railroad
                    to take me to Andersonville. I made the journey, however, in February.</p>
<p>On my arrival at Andersonville, unannounced and unexpected, I made an immediate
                    personal inspection of everything - not only as then existing, but with the aid
                    of the post and prison record, I went back several months, to the period when
                    the mortality was so great, to ascertain, if possible, its cause.</p>
<p>The guard then on duty consisted of a brigade of Georgia State troops, under
                    command of Brigadier-General Gartrell. The post was commanded by Colonel Gibbs,
                    who, as before stated, was an old army officer; and the prison proper was under
                    the immediate command of Captain Wirz, who was tried and executed at Washington,
                    in 1865, most unjustly, as the verdict of impartial history will establish; just
                    as will be the case in regard to Mrs. Surratt's horrible murder.</p>
<p>The officers first named, and all others on duty there, afforded me every
                    facility to prosecute my investigations to the fullest extent, and were prompt
                    to point out to me measures of relief that were practicable. I went within the
                    stockade and conversed with many of the prisoners. I found the prison and its
                    inmates in a bad condition: not as bad as our enemies have represented, yet
                    unfortunately bad. The location of the stockade was good, and had been
                    judiciously chosen for healthfulness. It occupied two gently sloping hillsides,
                    with a clear flowing brook dividing them; and being in the sandy portion of the
                    pine woods of Georgia, it was free from  local malaria, and had the
                    benefit of a genial and healthy climate. It was of sufficient capacity for from
                    8,000 to 9,000 prisoners, without uncomfortable crowding. The great mortality of
                    the previous year, I have no doubt, resulted in part from an excess of prisoners
                    over the fair capacity of the stockade, and from the lack of sufficient shelter
                    from the sun and rain. Before my arrival at Andersonville, Captain Wirz had, by
                    a communication forwarded through Colonel Gibbs, and approved by him, called my
                    attention to the great deficiency of shelter in the stockade, and asked
                    authority to supply it. He had made a similar application, I was informed, to
                    General Winder some time before, but it had not been acted on before the
                    General's death. In consequence of this want of buildings and shedding within
                    the stockade, the prisoners had excavated a great many subterranean vaults and
                    chambers in the hillsides, which many of them occupied, to the injury of their
                    health, as these places were not sufficiently ventilated.</p>
<p>The prisoners were very badly off for clothing, shoes and hats, and complained of
                    this destitution, and of the quantity and kind of rations-corn bread and bacon
                    chiefly-issued to them. I found, what I anticipated, that we had no clothing to
                    give them. Many of the men on duty as guards were in rags, and either
                    barefooted, or had their feet protected with worn out shoes held together with
                    strings and thongs, and in lieu of overcoats many had to protect themselves
                    against inclement weather with a tattered blanket drawn over the shoulders. Our
                    own men being in this destitute condition, it can be well understood that we
                    could not supply a large demand for clothing prisoners.</p>
<p>They also suffered greatly, and there had been great mortality, for want of
                    suitable medicines to treat the diseases incident to their condition with any
                    considerable success. From this cause, and this alone, I have no doubt thousands
                    died at Andersonville in 1864, who would be living to-day if the United States
                    Government had not declared medicines contraband of war, and by their close
                    blockade of our coasts deprived us of an adequate supply of those remedial
                    agents that therapeutical science and modern chemistry have produced for the
                    amelioration of suffering humanity. The object of this barbarous decree against
                    the Confederacy, it is now well understood, was to expose our soldiers, as well
                    as our wives, children and families, without protection or relief, to the
                    diseases common in our climate, and to make us an easy prey to death, approach
                    us in what form he might; not foreseeing, perhaps, that when the grim monster
                    stalked through our prisons he would find not alone <u>Confederates</u> for his victims, but the stalwart soldiers of the
                    Government which had invoked his aid against us. At the time of my inspection,
                    there was a good deal of sickness amongst the prisoners, but not a large
                    percentage of mortality. Our medical officers, even with their scanty pharmacopae, gave equal attention to sick friends and
                    enemies, to guard and to prisoners alike.</p>
<p>I investigated particularly the food question, and found that no 
                    discrimination was made in the issue of rations to guards and prisoners. In
                    quantity, quality and kind the daily supply was exactly the same, man for man.
                    It is true it was very scanty, consisting of a third or half a pound of meat a
                    day, and usually a pint or pint and a half of corn meal, with salt. Occasionally
                    there were small supplies of wheat flour, and sometimes a very few potatoes, but
                    they were rarely to be had. Other vegetables we had none. General Lee's army in
                    Virginia lived but little if any better. The food was sound and wholesome, but
                        meagre in quantity, and not such in kind and
                    variety as Federal soldiers had been accustomed to draw from their abundant
                    commissariat. Our soldiers did very well on "hog and hominy," and rarely
                    complained. The Federals thought it horrible to have nothing else, and but a
                    scanty supply of this simple food. Great scoundrelism was detected amongst the
                    prisoners in cheating each other. They were organized in companies of a hundred
                    each in the stockade, and certain men of their own selection were permitted to
                    come outside the stockade and draw the rations for their fellows, and cook them.
                    Many of these rascals would steal and secrete a part
                    of the food, and as opportunity offered sell it at an exorbitant rate to their
                    famished comrades. Shortly before I went to Andersonville six of these villains
                    were detected, and by permission of the prison authorities the prisoners
                    themselves organized a court of their own, tried them for the offence, found
                    them guilty, and hung them inside the stockade. This event led to a change in
                    the mode of issuing rations, which precluded the possibility of such a
                    diabolical traffic in stolen food.</p>
<p>Bad as was the physical condition of the prisoners, their mental depression was
                    worse, and perhaps more fatal. Thousands of them collected around me in the
                    prison, and begged me to tell them whether there was any hope of release by an
                    exchange of prisoners. Some time before that President Davis had permitted three
                    of the Andersonville prisoners to go to Washington to try and change the
                    determination of their Government and procure a resumption of exchanges. The
                    prisoners knew of the failure of this mission when I was at Andersonville, and
                    the effect was to plunge the great majority of them into the deepest melancholy,
                    homesickness and despondency. They believed their confinement would continue
                    till the end of the war, and many of them looked upon that as a period so
                    indefinite and remote that they believed that they would die of their sufferings
                    before the day of release came. I explained to them the efforts we had made and
                    were still making to effect an exchange. A Federal captain at Andersonville,
                    learning that I had a brother of the same rank (Captain F. M. Imboden, of the
                    Eighteenth Virginia Cavalry) incarcerated at Johnson's Island, in Lake Erie,
                    where he was in a fair way to die from harsh treatment and a lack of food,
                    represented to me that he had powerful connections at Washington, and thought
                    that if I would parole him he could effect his exchange for my brother, and
                    perhaps influence a decision on the general question of exchanges. He agreed to
                    return in  thirty days if he failed. I accepted his terms, and with
                    some difficulty got him through the lines. He failed, and returned within our
                    lines, but just in time to be set at liberty again, as will appear further on. I
                    regret that I have forgotten his name, and have no record of it.</p>
<p>I have already alluded to Captain Wirz's recommendation to put up more shelter. I
                    ordered it, and thereafter daily a hundred or more prisoners were paroled and
                    set to work in the neighboring forest. In the course of a fortnight comfortable
                    log houses, with floors and good chimneys-for which the prisoners made and burnt
                    the brick-were erected for twelve or fifteen hundred men, and were occupied by
                    those in feeble health, who were withdrawn from the large stockade and separated
                    from the mass of prisoners. This same man (Captain Wirz), who was tried and hung
                    as a murderer, warmly urged the establishment of a tannery and shoemaker's shop,
                    informing me that there were many men amongst the prisoners skilled in these
                    trades, and that some of them knew a process of very rapidly converting hides
                    into tolerably good leather. There were thousands of hides at Andersonville,
                    from the young cattle butchered during the previous summer and fall, whilst the
                    country yet contained such animals. I ordered this, too; and a few weeks later
                    many of the barefooted prisoners were supplied with rough, but comfortable
                    shoes; one of them made and sent to me a pair that surprised me, both by the
                    quality of the leather and the style of the shoes. Another suggestion came from
                    the medical staff of the post that I ordered to be at once put into practice: it
                    was to brew corn beer for those suffering from scorbutic taint. The corn meal-or
                    even whole corn-being scalded in hot water and a mash made of it, a little yeast
                    was added to promote fermentation, and in a few days a sharp acid beverage was
                    produced, by no means unpalatable, and very wholesome. Captain Wirz entered
                    warmly into this enterprise. I mention these facts to show that he was not the
                    monster he was afterwards represented to be, when his blood was called for by
                    infuriate fanaticism. I would have proved these facts if I had been permitted to
                    testify on his trial after I was summoned before the court by the United States,
                    and have substantiated them by the records of the prison and of my own
                    headquarters, if these records were not destroyed, suppressed or mutilated at
                    the time. But after being kept an hour in the court-room, during an earnest and
                    whispered consultation between the President of the court and the
                    Judge-Advocate, and their examination of a great mass of papers, the contents of
                    which I could not see, I was politely dismissed without examination, and told I
                    would be called at another time; but I never was, and thus Wirz was deprived of
                    the benefit of my evidence. My personal acquaintance with Captain Wirz was very
                    slight, but the facts I have alluded to satisfied me that he was a humane man,
                    and was selected as a victim to the bloody moloch of 1865, because he was a
                    foreigner and comparatively friendless. I put these facts on record now to
                    vindicate, as far as  they go, his memory from the monstrous crimes
                    falsely charged against him. No such charges ever reached me, whilst I was in a
                    position to have made it a duty to investigate them, as those upon which he was
                    tried and executed. He may have committed grave offences, but if so, I never
                    knew it, and do not believe it.</p>
<p>After having given my sanction and orders to carry out every suggestion of
                    others, or that occurred to my own mind for the amelioration of the condition of
                    the prisoners as far as we possessed the means, and having issued stringent
                    orders to preserve discipline amongst the guarding troops, and subordination,
                    quiet and good order amongst the prisoners, I went to Macon to confer with
                    General Howell Cobb and General Gideon J. Pillow as to the proper course for me
                    to pursue in the event of our situation in Georgia becoming more precarious, or
                    the chance of communication with the Government at Richmond being entirely cut
                    off, which appeared to be an almost certain event in the very near future. After
                    a full discussion of the situation, there was perfect accord in our views.
                    General Pillow was expecting to receive official notice of his appointment as
                    Commissary of Prisons, in which event he would become my commanding officer.
                    General Cobb commanded the State troops of Georgia, and I was dependent on him
                    for a sufficient force to discharge my duties and hold the prisoners in custody.
                    There was eminent propriety, therefore, in our conferring with each other, and
                    acting harmoniously in whatever course might be adopted. General Pillow took a
                    leading part in the discussion, and in shaping the conclusions to which we came.
                    In the absence of official information or instructions from Richmond, we acted
                    upon what the newspapers announced as a recently established arrangement with
                    General Grant, which was, in effect, that either side might deliver to the other
                    on parole, but without exchange, any prisoners they chose, taking simply a
                    receipt for them. We had no official information of any such agreement from our
                    Government, but it was regarded by us as very probably true, and we decided to
                    act upon it. The difficulty of supplying the prisoners with even a scanty ration
                    of corn meal and bacon was increasing daily. The cotton States had never been a
                    grazing country, and therefore we had few or no animals left there for food,
                    except hogs. These States were not a large wheat producing region, and for that
                    reason we had to depend mainly on corn for bread. Salt was scarce and hard to
                    obtain. Vegetables we had none for army purposes. We were destitute of clothing,
                    and of the materials and machinery to manufacture it in sufficient quantities
                    for our own soldiers and people. And the Federal Government, remaining deaf to
                    all appeals for exchange of prisoners, it was manifest that the incarceration of
                    their captured soldiers could no longer be of any possible advantage to us,
                    since to relieve their sufferings that government would take no step, if it
                    involved a similar release of our men in their hands. Indeed, it was manifest
                    that they looked upon it as an advantage to them and an injury to us to leave
                    their  prisoners in our hands to eat out our little remaining
                    substance. In view of all these facts and considerations, Generals Cobb and
                    Pillow and I were of one mind that the best thing that could be done was,
                    without further efforts to get instructions from Richmond, to make arrangements
                    to send off all the prisoners we had at Eufaula and Andersonville to the nearest
                    accessible Federal post, and having paroled them not to bear arms till regularly
                    exchanged, to deliver them unconditionally, simply taking a receipt on
                    descriptive rolls of the men thus turned over.</p>
<p>In pursuance of this determination, and as soon as the necessary arrangements
                    could be made, a detachment of about 1,500 men, made up from the two prisons,
                    was sent to Jackson, Mississippi, by rail and delivered to their friends.
                    General "Dick" Taylor at that time commanded the department through which these
                    prisoners were sent to Jackson, and objected to any more being sent that way, on
                    the ground that they would pick up information on the route detrimental to our
                    military interests. The only remaining available outlet was at Saint Augustine,
                    Florida, Sherman having destroyed railway communication with Savannah. Finding
                    that the prisoners could be sent from Andersonville by rail to the
                    Chattahoochie, thence down that river to Florida, near Quincy, and from Quincy
                    by rail to Jacksonville, within a day's march of Saint Augustine, it was
                    resolved to open communication with the Federal commander at the latter place.
                    With that view, somewhere about the middle of March, Captain Rutherford, an
                    intelligent and energetic officer, was sent to Saint Augustine. A few days after
                    his departure for Florida, he telegraphed from Jacksonville, "Send on the
                    prisoners." He had, as he subsequently reported, arranged with the Federal
                    authorities to receive them. At once all were ordered to be sent forward who
                    were able to bear the journey. Three days' cooked rations were prepared, and so
                    beneficial to health was the revival of the spirits of these men by the prospect
                    of once more being at liberty, that I believe all but twelve or fifteen reported
                    themselves able to go, and did go. The number sent was over 6,000. Only enough
                    officers and men of the guard went along to keep the prisoners together,
                    preserve order, and facilitate their transportation. To my amazement the officer
                    commanding the escort telegraphed back from Jacksonville that the Federal
                    commandant at Saint Augustine refused to receive and receipt for the prisoners
                    till he could hear from General Grant, who was then in front of Petersburg,
                    Virginia, and with whom he could only communicate by sea along the coast, and
                    asking my instructions under the circumstances. Acting without the known
                    sanction of the Government at Richmond, I was afraid to let go the prisoners
                    without some official acknowledgment of their delivery to the United States, and
                    knowing that two or three weeks must elapse before General Grant's will in the
                    premises could be made known, and it being impossible to subsist our men and the
                    prisoners at Jacksonville, I could pursue but one course. I ordered their  return to Andersonville, directing that the reason for this
                    unexpected result should be fully explained to them. Provisions were hastily
                    collected and sent to meet them, and in a few days all were back in their old
                    quarters. I was not there on their return, but it was reported to me that their
                    indignation against their Government was intense, many declaring their readiness
                    to renounce allegiance to it and take up arms with us. The old routine was
                    resumed at Andersonville, but it was not destined to continue long.</p>
<p>Before any further communication reached me from Saint Augustine, General Wilson,
                    with a large body of cavalry, approached Georgia from the West. It was evident
                    that his first objective point was Andersonville. Again conferring with Generals
                    Cobb and Pillow, and finding we were powerless to prevent Wilson's reaching
                    Andersonville, where he would release the prisoners and capture all our officers
                    and troops there, it was decided without hesitation again to send the prisoners
                    to Jacksonville and turn them loose, to make the best of their way to their
                    friends at Saint Augustine. This was accomplished in a few days, the post at
                    Andersonville was broken up, the Georgia State troops were sent to General Cobb
                    at Macon, and in a short time the surrender of General Johnston to Sherman,
                    embracing all that section of country, the Confederate prisons ceased to exist,
                    and on the 3d of May, 1865, I was myself a prisoner of war on parole at Augusta,
                    Georgia. A few days later I was sent with other paroled Confederates to Hilton
                    Head, South Carolina, where I met about 2,000 of the Andersonville prisoners,
                    who had been sent up from Saint Augustine, to be thence shipped North. Their
                    condition was much improved. Many of them were glad to see me, and four days
                    later I embarked with several hundred of them on the steam transport "Thetis"
                    for Fortress Monroe, and have reason to believe that every man of them felt
                    himself my friend rather than an enemy.</p>
<p>It has been charged that Mr. Davis, as President of the Confederate States, was
                    responsible for the sufferings of prisoners held in the South. During my four
                    months' connection with this disagreeable branch of Confederate military
                    service, no communication, direct or indirect, was ever received by me from Mr.
                    Davis, and, so far as I remember, the records of the prison contained nothing to
                    implicate him in any way with its management or administration. I have briefly
                    alluded to the causes of complaint on the part of prisoners, and even where
                    these were well founded, I am at a loss to see how Mr. Davis is to be held
                    responsible before the world for their existence, till it is proved that he knew
                    of them and failed to remove delinquent officers.</p>
<p>The real cause of all the protracted sufferings of prisoners North and South is
                    directly due to the inhuman refusal of the Federal Government to exchange
                    prisoners of war, a policy that we see from the facts herein stated was carried
                    so far as to induce a commanding officer, at Saint Augustine, to refuse even to
                    receive, and acknowledge that he had received, over 6,000 men of his own side,
                         tendered to him unconditionally, from that prison in the South
                    which, above all others, they charged to have been the scene of unusual
                    suffering. The inference is irresistible that this officer felt that it would be
                    dangerous to his official character to relieve the Confederacy of the burthen of supporting these prisoners, although he and
                    his countrymen affected to believe that we were slowly starving them to death.
                    The policy at Washington was to let Federal prisoners starve, if the process
                    involved the Confederates in a similar catastrophe-and "fired the Northern
                    heart."</p>
<p>I have introduced more of my personal movements and actions into this recital
                    than is agreeable or apparently in good taste, but it has been unavoidable in
                    making the narrative consecutive and intelligible, and I trust will be pardoned,
                    even if appearing to transcend the bounds of becoming modesty. In the absence of
                    all my official papers relating to these subjects (which I presume were taken to
                    Washington after I surrendered them, and are still there, unless it was deemed
                    policy to destroy them when Captain Wirz was on trial), I have not been able to
                    go into many minute details that might add interest to the statement, but
                    nothing, I think, to the leading fact-that the United States refused an
                    unconditional delivery of so many of its own men, inmates of that prison
                    (Andersonville), which they professed then to regard as a Confederate
                    slaughter-pen and place of intentional diabolical cruelties inflicted on the
                    sick and helpless. Was this course not a part of a policy of deception for
                    "firing the Northern heart"? Impartial history will one day investigate and
                    answer this question. And there we may safely leave it, with a simple record of
                    the facts.</p>
<p>Very truly, your friend,<br> J. D. IMBODEN</p>
