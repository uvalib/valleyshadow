<h3 class="section-head">Augusta County: "Roster of M'Neil's Rangers," by , September 24, 1905</h3>
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> The excerpts below are the introduction and conclusion to a reprinted roster of
                    Confederate veterans. In the tone, we can see the affection for veterans that
                    gripped so many southerners (and Americans) at the turn of the twentieth
                    century.</p>
<p>The following is republished from the Staunton Spectator, by request, and
                    published with pleasure, that it may be preserved along with other Confederate
                    history that finds its way from "Our Confederate Column" to the scrap-books of
                    the old boys who "fit" under "Marse Bob."</p>
<p>The Confederate Column takes it as it finds it in the Specatator, adding only the
                    little story at the bottom.</p>
<p>We have been furnished by one of McNeil's men, Corporal D. M. Parsons, with a
                    complete list of Captain John H. McNeil's Partisan Rangers, which next to
                    Mosby's Battalion, was the most noted command of scouts that operated in
                    Virginia during the war. Many of them will be recognized as gallant Augusta and
                    Rockingham boys. There are 187 of them, all being Virginians except nineteen,
                    who were from Maryland, and are marked Md. in the
                    list.</p>
<p>[roster of names]</p>
<p>Among this company's many daring exploits was the raid of 1864 into Cumberland,
                        Md., which was occupied by over ten thousand
                    Federal troops, and their successful capture of Generals Crook and Kelly, whom
                    they brought safely through the lines to Richmond.</p>
