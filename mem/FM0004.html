<h3 class="section-head">Franklin County: "The 77th Re-Union," by Unknown, August 23, 1870</h3>
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> An announcement of an upcoming reunion for the 77th PA Volunteers, including a
                    short description of their accomplishments.</p>
<p>The time for holding the second annual re-union of the survivors of the 77th
                    Regiment Pennsylvaeia Volunteers, is fast
                    approaching. The re-union is to take place in Chambersburg, on the 13th of
                    October, and we hope our citizens will extend the survivors of the old 77th such
                    a reception as will be befitting the occasion.</p>
<p>The 77th was recruited by Col. F. S. Stumbaugh,
                    assisted by Lieut. Col. P. B. Housum and
                        Maj. Bradford. In the original formation of the
                    Regiment, there were but eight companies, officered as follows: Co. A, S. R. M'Kesson; Co. F, W. S. Wishert; Co. G, Alex. Philips;
                        Co. C, M. M'Nally; Co. D, J. R. Frey; Co. B, T. E. Rose. To
                    these eight companies a battery was attached, commanded by Capt. Muchler. Compang B was raised in
                        Pittsburg, and subsequently three others from
                    that vicinity were added to the regiment, officered by Capt. W. A. Robinson, Sidney J. Brauff, and James Shock.</p>
<p>During the term of its service, nearly 2000 names were upon the roll of the
                    Regiment.-But 60 per cent of this number are now living, and out of the original
                    800, who left this place in 1861, (October 13), but 120 are now living.</p>
<p>The 77th Regiment was the only Pennsylvania regiment that participated in the
                    battle of Shiloh. The commander of the Division, Maj. Gen. Alex. McD. Mcook, in his official report, paid a glowing
                    tribute to it gallantry in the final charge on that bloody field. In the action
                    at Stone River, where Lieut. Col. Housum
                    fell while leading a charge, the conduct of the 77th won from Gen. Rosecrans the highest commendation as the "only
                    regiment in its corps that did not break during the entire engagement."</p>
<p>We presume the programme of this second re-union of the Regiment will be made
                    public at an early day, as the time is near at hand when the arrangements will
                    be made. Col. F. S. Stumbaugh and Capt G. W. Skinner, of this place, were present at
                    the first re-union at Pittsburg last year, the
                    first named gentleman in the absence of Col. F. S.
                    Pyfer, presiding.</p>
