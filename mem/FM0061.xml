                <p>Mr. Jacob Pensinger</p>
                <p>Dear Sir:-Having arrived in camp late last evening, I take this the first
                    opportunity to inform you of the death of <abbr expan="Sergeant">Sergt</abbr>
                    Simon W. Rupley of my Company. He was severely wounded in the action near <orig
                        reg="Chancellorsville">Chancellersville</orig> about 11 o'clock A. M. on the
                    third of May and died on the evening of that day in the hospital of our
                    division.</p>
                <p>In him we have lost one of the best soldiers in the company, and Greencastle
                    certainly one of its best citizens. I have received from the surgeon in charge
                    of the hospital what notions he had in his pockets when he died, Viz-1 pocket
                    book containing $7.65, 1 knife, comb, testament and etc. He was buried in a
                    coffin near the hospital.</p>
                <p>You please communicate these facts to his wife and oblige.</p>
                <p>Yours respectfully<lb/><abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> A. R. Davison, <abbr

                    Lieutenant Rowe is severely wounded though not dangerously, George Missavy died
                    of his wounds. John Rebinsoa, <abbr expan="William">Wm.</abbr> F. Rupert, Scott
                    K. Snively, Iac Winger and John Beamisdefer were all slightly wounded. In <abbr

                    are wounded.</p>

                    K. is also missing and I suppose taken prisoner, at least we have not heard from
                    him since the action.</p>
                <p>I will take the articles from <abbr expan="Sergeant">Sergt.</abbr> Rupley home
                    with me when I come home which will be between 15th and 20th of month.<lb/>
                    Andy.</p>
                <p>Mr. Rupley's death was all the more sad owing to the fact, that his time of <orig
                        reg="enlistment">inlistment</orig> had expired and there was no need for him
                    going into battle, other than his own sense of duty. It was a brave, <orig
                        reg="true">ture</orig> and loyal spirit that forced him to fight as a
                    private citizen in the ranks with his <orig reg="comrades">comrads</orig> after
                    his enlistment had expired. He could have saved his life, but to <orig
                        reg="save">savd</orig> his country was his thought and purpose, and to that
                    end he went into battle and laid his life upon its <orig reg="altar"
                    >alter</orig>. that through his death and thousands like him, liberty might live
                    and transcend the ages</p>
