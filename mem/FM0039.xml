                <p>In 1914, Kauffman's Progressive reprinted this report--originally printed in
                    1862--from an ex-governor of Virginia who paroled from prison. It mentions that
                    many Confederates still believe that they are winning the war and expect the
                    Union to surrender at any time.</p>

            <div1 type="article" id="d5">
                <p>We see by an exchange that the son of "Extra Billy Smith," Ex-governor of
                    Virginia, who has been confined for sometime in Fort Warren, has been released
                    on his parole of honor in exchange for Mr. William Ayres, merchant of
                    Philadelphia who was captured about four weeks ago, while visiting the
                    battlefield of Manassas. We learn from our friend, George B. Ayres who is a
                    brother of the first named, that the capture was effected by a squad of Stewarts
                    Virginia Guerrillas, who were prowling about that section disguised in citizens
                    clothes, and who after securing their illegal prey, carried him for miles
                    through pine woods and by-roads in order to escape our pickets. Mr. Ayres was
                    confined in the same tobacco warehouse with <abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr>
                    Corcorau and a great number of the original Bull Run prisoners. He relates a
                    "strange eventful history" of his personal experiences and the condition of
                    affairs in Richmond and elsewhere in his travels. He says it would be beyond all
                    possibility to convince anyone in Richmond that the North was not stagnated and
                    impoverished, and their greatest wonder is why the Government don't surrender at
                    at once! They are confident of victory, and the people hear very little of the
                    successes of the Federal arms. <orig reg="He">Hs</orig> reports much, however,
                    which it is not expedient to print and after four weeks living under the "stars
                    and bars," is perfectly satisfied to flourish in all the future under the
                    glorious "old gridiron" whose broad stripes and bright stars are destined to be
                    yet the proudest standard in all the world.</p>
