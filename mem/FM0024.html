<h3 class="section-head">Franklin: "The Women of Franklin County in the Civil War," by Parker
                            R. Skinner, 1923</h3>
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> This lengthy excerpt from the Kittochtinny Historical Society program portrays
                    the crucial role of Franklin County women during the Civil War. Parker Skinner
                    writes about the burden of waiting women faced while their loved ones battled,
                    the attention women paid to the sick and wounded, and the notion that men fought
                    to protect their women and homes.</p>
<p>Society entertained at the Falling Spring Church House by Dr. John K. Gordon, R.
                    C. Gordon, George Lenher and J. A. Kell, December 16th, 1920.</p>
<p>The writer, or rather the compiler, of this evening's paper confesses that he
                    undertook the task with considerable reluctance. So much has already been told
                    and told in such an able way on this and similar subjects that he feared that he
                    would be unable to aid to the wealth of valuable information already written
                    down. However, upon investigation, he came to the conclusion that he would be
                    unable to cover the subject in anything like a complete manner. The work of the
                    women in this section of the country covered so great a territory that the half
                    will never be told and I only hope to add a little to the great fund of
                    information already published.</p>
<p>A late fellow-member of this Society, Mr. Lynn Harbaugh, in his able and
                    comprehensive paper, "Angels of Mercy" says: "If there be any redeeming feature
                    in this outline sketch, it will be found perhaps in pointing out just where the
                    future student of history may begin his work on this subject. An array of facts,
                    almost bewildering in its vastness, will be found in the files of the Waynesboro
                    Village Record, the Mercersburg Journal, the Greencastle Pilot and the weeklies
                    of our own town. These, together with "Hoke's Reminiscences", [sic] will furnish
                    material for a concise volume of at least 500 pages upon the "Angels of Mercy."</p>
<p>The writer of this evening's paper only hopes to add to the fund of material
                    already collected and to help to pave the way for the future historian who will
                    treat the subject in its entirety. In doing thus it will be necessary to relate
                    the incidents in a more or less disconnected manner, [begin page 429] and I ask
                    your kind indulgence if you find this paper rather a disconnected discourse.</p>
<p>There is one feature of the suffering endured by women during the days of war
                    that has not been greatly enlarged upon and that is the mental suffering
                    attendent [sic] upon long separation from a loved one. Much has been written
                    about the welfare work of our American Women in our different wars, but little
                    has been said about the weary hours of waiting for the delayed letter from the
                    field of battle. The sad perusing of the "Casualty List" by the Mothers, Wives,
                    Sisters and Sweethearts has been unnoticed. The pathetic way in which she gazes
                    at the vacant chair has not been sufficiently recognized.</p>
<p>The men and women in the active service often suffer great physical discomforts;
                    but not the great mental disturbance of the weary waiter at home, whose heart is
                    engulfed in the gunfire of battle and encamped amid the campfires of the loved
                    one. Those in active service do not have the time for such mental suffering.
                    Their arduous duties take the mind from the sentimental feature of warfare.
                    Nowhere has this idea been better expressed than in the dedication of a book of
                    poetry and pictures, compiled by two privates of the late A. E. F. The book is
                    entitled, "I was there" and the dedication reads:</p>
<p>"To Our Mothers"</p>
<p>"Ours the Great Adventure Yours the pain to bear, Ours the golden service
                    stripes, Yours the marks of care.</p>
<p>If all the Great Adventure, The Old Earth ever knew, Was ours and in this little
                    book, "Twould still belong to you."</p>
<p>This spirit of sadness at the departure of loved ones was not so evident at the
                    beginning of the Civil War. It was freely predicted that the contest would be
                    over in ninety days. The first enlistments were for three [begin page 430]
                    months and it was generally thought that the worst would be over in that trine.
                    Then on the very day that these short term enlistments expired came the
                    disasterous [sic] defeat at Bull Run, Sunday, July 21st, 1861; and the feeling
                    of confidence changed to one of great consternation. No one had ever dreamed
                    that so stupendous a disaster was possible and immediately came a call for
                    100,000 men, and an enlistment for nine months. The spirit of gayety which so
                    often attends martial music changed to the feeling that we were engaged in a
                    deadly struggle.</p>
<p>The first unit to enlist from Chambersburg was the Chambers' Artillery, a
                    Military Organization which had been organized in the early fifties and which
                    volunteered for the Federal Service, April 19th, 1861; and the bombardment of
                    Fort Sumpter, [sic] which began the war for the Union, began at half-past four
                    on the morning of Friday, April 12th, 1861. Thus just one week after the
                    outbreak of hostilities, Franklin County was represented in the Federal Service
                    by a small unit of true patriots. These men are truly entitled to be numbered
                    among the "First Defenders." Capt. John C. Gerbig, of town, then a lad in his
                    teens, began his splendid military career with this company.</p>
<p>However, the departure of these early defenders of the Union did not create a
                    great deal of excitement; for, as has been said, the war was expected to be of
                    but short duration. It is true that after the firing on Fort Sumpter, [sic] a
                    flag pale was put up on the Square and a number of patriotic meetings were held;
                    but it was not until after McClellan, in July, 1862, with his splendid army was
                    hurled back from Richmond that the God of battles imposed a fearful burden upon
                    the hearts and minds of the mothers, wives, and girlhood of Franklin County.
                    Then it was that this section made its largest contribution to the cause of
                    Liberty in the enrollment of the 126th Volunteer Infantry. More than seven
                    companies were recruited for this organization in Franklin County. It was eat
                    long after this that the cry "Enlist for Three Years or during the War" made the
                    mental suffering of those awaiting at home almost unbearable. [begin page 431]</p>
<p>It must be borne in mind that Franklin County, on account of its peculiar
                    geographical position, suffered more of the horrors than did any section North
                    of the Mason and Dixon Line. The opening of the Cumberland Valley into the
                    Valley of the Potomac and the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia was responsible for
                    our women suffering more of the real horrors of warfare than those of any part
                    of the country.</p>
<p>Let us see how it was incumbent upon our women, not only to say "Good-bye" to
                    their friends and relatives but to bid "God-speed" to the brave soldiers of
                    other states who were marching through here to the fields of battle. I quote
                    from a letter written by a young girl of Chambersburg, in the early days of the
                    war, which proves that the marching of military units was not a novel sight in
                    our community.</p>
<p>Chambersburg, Pa.<br> June 18th, 186'1.</p>
<p>(Note the date is barely two months after the beginning of hostilities.)</p>
<p>Dear Friends:--</p>
<p>We received your letter today and I now sit down to reply. To give you any idea
                    of the stirring scenes that are witnessed here daily would be out of my power. I
                    have been kept very busy as we have had a great many soldiers stopping in for
                    their meals and we were glad to do all that we could for the defenders of our
                    country. Among the Rhode Islander we had a great grandson of old Nathaniel Green
                    here for breakfast one morning.</p>
<p>At about two o'clock last Thursday morning the 11th Pennsylvania Regiment came
                    into town.</p>
<p>The trains bearing the soldiers generally lie opposite our house far sometime. In
                    the morning Thomas (her brother) went down and found many of his scholar from
                    Latrobe among them. They were soon moved down to Camp McClure, which is a little
                    below us. That afternoon I went out with some ladies and gentlemen to see the
                    newly arrived. There was a Regiment from Wisconsin and another from Connecticut
                    in the same field. We went [begin page 432] around among the Yankee boys, then
                    to the Wisconsin Unit, and finally to the 11th Pennsylvania; as I expressed a
                    great desire to see if I could find any acquaintances; but how was I to find
                    them if they should be there among such a great crowd of men? At length I
                    inquired for Patrick Williams of Latrobe and several men started in search of
                    him. Then a young man came up and reached out his hand and said, "Lucinda, how
                    do you do," I did not recognize him and he said his name was Anderson and that
                    he was a son of Joe Anderson's who used to live beside of us. I was stupified
                    [sic] with surprise and could only say, "Why Robie is it you?" You can imagine
                    how rejoiced I was to see him. We also found Samuel McConnell's son, Charles,
                    among them.</p>
<p>On Sabbath morning we heard that they were to be ready to march at noon that day.
                    Thomas and I got ready and started down to bid them farewell. As we passed
                    through the grove between our house and the camp we found the Connecticut boys
                    assembled for worship. I never witnessed anything more impressive. Sometimes I
                    could not refrain from tears. Their Chaplain, a tall fine looking man dressed in
                    uniform, stood on a little rise. In front of him stood the choir and there were
                    some fine singers among them. They had twp violins and a flute. One of the
                    pieces sung was "The Shining Shore". [sic] Perhaps you have heard it -- it is a
                    most beautiful piece of music. This regiment is splendidly equipped and they
                    made a most magnificent appearance. To the right of the minister waved a large
                    and very beautiful flag of the United States and on the left an equally
                    beautiful one of the State of Connecticut. We went down to bid them good-bye but
                    they did not go until Monday morning. Robert Anderson came up and stayed a whale
                    Sunday afternoon and took supper with us.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon Thomas and Mrs. Nixon (a lady of this town and also a member
                    of our church) came hurrying to get me. A short distance a train was lying
                    containing Capt. Doubleday and his men from Fort Sumpter [sic] and Young
                    Governor Sprague of Rhode Island. Mrs. Nixon [begin page 433] has a son, an
                    officer in the regular army at Fort Leavenworth. We went up to the train and
                    were introduced to the officers. On shaking hands with Captain Doubleday I said:
                    "I feel highly honored by shaking the hand of so noble a defender of our
                    country." He very politely and modestly replied, "I think the honor is conferred
                    upon me." What a noble fellow Gov. Sprague is. He was dressed exactly like the
                    common soldiers. Capt. Doubleday thinks the war will end in a month, but, who
                    can know? Time will tell.</p>
<p>Yesterday they received orders to repair at once to Washington. The orders were
                    countermanded too late, far they had gone. Today they passed through here again
                    on their way to Hagerstown.</p>
<p>There were some very heavy cannons taken through today. I can say no more at
                    present, write to me,</p>
<p>Yours,<br> LUCINDA RICHARDS</p>
<p>The brother, Thomas Richards, wrote a letter the following day, June 19th, 1851,
                    giving additional information concerning Gov. Sprague and Captain Doubleday. He
                    says in part:</p>
<p>"We are in the midst of the most exciting scenes I ever expected to witness.
                    Louie gave you a description of her introduction to Capt. Doubleday. I had met
                    him before. I had bade him farewell when he passed through here on his way to
                    Hagerstown. When the Rebels left Harpers Ferry it was supposed that they would
                    move towards Washington and the regulars were sent through here enroute to the
                    Capital. They were recalled, however, at Harrisburg and passed back through here
                    yesterday at noon with some very large guns. It was while they were here that
                    Louie delivered her patriotic speech to Capt. Doubleday. She did it with all the
                    dignity of a heroine and his modest reply showed him to be the soldier and
                    gentleman we had heard him to be.</p>
<p>The famous young Gov. Sprague was asleep on Capt. Doubleday's knee when I entered
                    the car. I apologized for the liberty I was taking, and told Capt. Double-[begin
                    page 434]day I had two ladies on the outside who desired the pleasure of seeing
                    him. He came out and spent a few minutes in conversation with us.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Gov. Sprague had roused up and was looking out the window. He appeared
                    so sleepy, having had no sleep the night before, that I did not like to disturb
                    him. He was dressed in a blue flannel blouse and grey [sic] pants like his men.
                    He is said to be worth 10 million dollars. Capt. Doubleday told me he owned 14
                    calico print works and had 3 million dollars worth of bills due him in the
                    South. He once said to his men: "Boys, I want you to go down and board it out."
                    This young man is the great grandson of General Greene of Revolutionary fame.</p>
<p>The Wisconsin Regiment, over 1, 000 men, were a fine, regiment -- as well drilled
                    as any I have seen and commanded by Col. Starkweather. This was their first
                    resting place from Milwaukee. They, with the fourth Connecticut and the 11th
                    Pennsylvania were encamped in sight of our house. At their departure for the
                    seat of war on Sunday evening, I witnessed a scene I will never forget and
                    cannot describe. They renewed their oath of fidelity to the beautiful Flag which
                    had been presented to them by the ladies of Milwaukee."</p>
<p>Yours,<br> THOMAS M. RICHARDS</p>
<p>(I hope you will pardon me for quoting so much but who can tell these things
                    better than the eye-witnesses themselves.)</p>
<p>Now let us try to find out the effect of these great troop movements upon the
                    minds of the mothers, who had loved ones at the Front. In order to bring this
                    out I will quote a letter written to the War Department by George Eyster,
                    Esquire. Mr. Eyster was a lawyer in Chambersburg during the days of the
                    Rebellion. His letter is of especial personal interest and it seems to me that
                    it is of historical value. [begin page 435]</p>
<p>Chambersburg, Pa.<br> October 21st, 1863.</p>
<p>Dear Sir: --</p>
<p>Washington Skinner, minor son (aged between sixteen and seventeen) of David
                    Skinner of this County, was a student at Jefferson College in December last.
                    About the middle of that month, in company with 20 other students, he went to
                    Harrisburg, intending to enlist in the 141th [sic] Pennsylvania. So far as young
                    Skinner was concerned, the scheme failed. He was rejected from that regiment, on
                    what ground I am not informed (age). Not satisfied, Skinner enrolled himself in
                    the 77th Pennsylvania whether at Harrisburg, Pittsburgh or some other point I
                    cannot say. He reached the regiment in time to participate in the battle of
                    Murfreesboro. He acted well and was within four feet of Lt. Col. Housum at the
                    time that officer received his mortal wound. It was not until after that battle
                    that his father discovered his whereabouts. The 1ad proud of his participation
                    in the fight, could not resist the desire to at once make known his desertion
                    from college and entrance into the army. His father has taken the earliest
                    possible opportunity to protest against his enlistment and demand his discharge.
                    Since his enlistment he has by no act or word countenanced or acquiesced in the
                    same. The mother of the boy, as is usual, is greatly distressed and clamors for
                    his discharge and the father is even more urgent in claiming it on her account.
                    I take it that the department will discharge him under all circumstances on
                    application being made, and shall be glad to know, at the earliest moment, the
                    nature of its action in its premises. I enclose you an affidavit of facts. The
                    father could not give me the letter of the Company but the regiment is so small
                    (not more than 180 in all) that there will be no difficulty in finding the boy.</p>
<p>Very truly yours,<br> GEORGE EYSTER.</p>
<p>This letter had the desired effect for shortly afterward the 77th Pennsylvania
                    was encamped in Cairo, [begin page 436] Illinois, and the Captain of the lad's
                    company called the boy into his tent and asked him if he were homesick and the
                    boy replied in the negative. "All right", [sic] said the Captain, "I have your
                    discharge from the War Department here and we wall destroy it, if you do not
                    wish to go home." Thus, the incident ended, but not the lonely yearning of the
                    mother at Dry Run, Franklin County, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>When one reads a sample of the kind of correspondence received by the mothers and
                    fathers of the boys at scene of warfare, he can little wonder that their hearts
                    were filled with apprehension. The sample which I quote was one written very
                    shortly after the Battle of Chickamauga, which was fought on the 18th and 19th
                    of September 1863. The Indian word "Chickamauga" means "River of Death" and the
                    name was fearfully appropriate. It was one of the most stubbornly contested
                    battles of the Civil War. The percentage of losses was greater than those
                    incurred by the British Army in 100 years, including Waterloo and the Crimea.
                    Thirty regiments, composed mostly of Western Soldiers, lost ten per cent more
                    men than fell in the "charge of the light brigade! Is it any wonder that the
                    letter which follows caused even greater distress in the mind of the mother and
                    redoubled the efforts of the father to have his son discharged. The letter would
                    also seem to indicate that the rules of the censor were not nearly as strict in
                    those days as during the late war.</p>
<p>Camp Near Whiteside, Tenn.<br> November 7th, 1863.</p>
<p>Dear Father: --</p>
<p>I received your very kind and welcome letter yesterday evening. I had almost
                    despaired of hearing from home, for it was almost two months since your last
                    letter prior to the one I received last evening came to hand. Last evening,
                    however, I got 3 letters, one from home and two from Cannonsburg. Your letter
                    found me in the best of health and spirits. We are now encamped near Whiteside,
                    Tenn., along R. R. running from Steveson, Ala. [begin page 437] to Chattanooga
                    and about 14 miles from the latter place. We left Chattanooga on the 25th day of
                    October and marched to this place and right glad indeed were we to leave it, for
                    our men there are on half rations and even some of that is spoiled. We get an
                    abundance of rations here however and we expect to have the railroad open to
                    Chattanooga in a few days, then our soldiers there will fare better.</p>
<p>Hooker's men are plenty here now. I saw several Pennsylvania Regiments that came
                    out with him. They acknowledge this service here to be harder than it is on the
                    Potomac. They got plenty to eat there and here we don't. When any of their
                    troops pass ours, you will hear our boys shouting, "Soft bread, pickles, and
                    potatoes" at them.</p>
<p>I am still clerking at Headquarters. It will be one month against the 10th of
                    this month since I was detailed here. I am beginning to understand my business
                    right well. I now write with a quill pen instead of a steel pen. I think they
                    are the best once a person gets used to them. Albert Stark got a letter from our
                    boy who is a prisoner in Richmond. It came through by flag of truce. Oliver
                    Skinner, Oliver Gamble, James Wineman are all safe and sound in Castle Thunder
                    prison.</p>
<p>You wanted to know how I escaped in the last fight. Well, I will try to tell you
                    as near as possible.</p>
<p>In the evening, about 2 o'clock, our regiment, together with the rest of our
                    Division made a charge on the enemy and drove them past our lines and about 1/2
                    mile into their own lines, where we halted and held our ground until dark. When
                    our army failed to drive the enemy as far as our Division did, we were left with
                    our right about 1/2 a mile in front of the left of our army. Old Bragg saw this
                    and as soon as dark came, he threw a large force in the gap between our Division
                    and the main army, with the expectation of capturing us; but, he had not posted
                    himself well enough to succeed. However, he got a greater part of our regiment
                    and the 79th Illinois. As soon as I discovered that they were trying to surround
                    us, I struck back [begin page 438] towards the rear. I had not gone far in the
                    dark until I ran right into a force of them in our rear. I was so close to them
                    that I could see the whites of their eyes. I saw their officers on horseback and
                    heard them give the command to fire, which was done as quick as said but not
                    quick enough for me. Stark and some more of the boys before me fell flat down on
                    the ground as soon as they heard the command and their bullets passed over me.
                    When they stopped firing, I jumped up and ran past them and escaped towards the
                    rear, I could hear them telling our men to lay down their arms and surrender,
                    but, I kept no account of that. I was determined not to be taken prisoner. I saw
                    Stark shoot an Officer off his horse that night. He escaped in the same way I
                    did.</p>
<p>If I ever get home I will be able to tell you better. We expect to get paid in a
                    week or two. We have about $60.00 coming to us. I will save as much as I can and
                    send it home. I think once I get home again I will have learned by experience
                    and make better use of my time than I did before.</p>
<p>As I have given you the most interesting news, I will close for the present. Give
                    my love to mother and the children and all inquiring friends.</p>
<p>Answer as soon as possible. Please excuse all mistakes.</p>
<p>With many thanks for your kind advice and the determination to profit by it, I
                    remain as ever,</p>
<p>Your affectionate son, <br> W. SKINNER, <br> 77th Pa. Volunteers.</p>
<p>I fear I have sadly drifted away from my subject; but, I warned you that this was
                    merely an attempt to add to the many things already told about the work of the
                    women in Franklin County during the Civil War.</p>
<p>Early in 1861, before the shot and shell on Southern battlefields began to fill
                    our available hospitals with wounded, the need of hospital service in this
                    community was badly felt. The troops moving toward the field of action often
                    left their sick behind. The army was com- [begin page 439] posed of men fresh
                    from civilian life and the rigors of camp life often brought on serious illness.
                    Several temporary hospitals were established in town and a permanent
                    organization for the work was affected on May 13, 1861.</p>
<p>The battle of Antietam in September 1862 brought on the worst difficulties yet
                    experienced. Nearly 500 wounded soldiers were brought to Chambersburg. The most
                    of them were placed in the King Street School House, Franklin Hall and the old
                    Academy.</p>
<p>A short time ago the writer met Captain Hay of Philadelphia. The Captain asked
                    where I was from and when I told him he told of his first visit to Chambersburg.
                    He was badly wounded at the Battle of Antietam and lay for several days with
                    little or no attention. Finally transportation was furnished and he was moved to
                    Chambersburg. From has description it was evident that he had been placed in the
                    King Street School House. He told me of the excellent care that he received
                    there and how daily the women of the town came to care for the wounded. No one
                    ever came empty handed, always bringing fruit and other articles of flood. There
                    were a great many women in town prominently identified with this work. The list
                    includes such well known Chambersburg names as Mrs. Lull, Mrs. Ritter, Mrs.
                    Horner, Mrs. Dr. Fisher, Mrs. Kennedy, Miss Nettie Flack, Miss Annie Newman,
                    Mrs. Lowe, Mrs. McKinley, Mrs. Hull, Mrs. McCullough, Mrs. Embich, Mrs. Beatie,
                    Mrs. Ehrhart, Mrs. Eyster, Mrs. Gilmore, Mrs. Watson, Mrs. Nead, Mrs. Hoke, Mrs.
                    Reeves, Mrs. Culbertson, Mrs. Clark, Mrs. Douglas, Mrs. Huber, Mrs. Nelson, Mrs.
                    Caufman, Mrs. Bard, Mrs. Paxton, Mrs. Gilmore, Mrs. Watson, Mrs. Nixon, Mrs.
                    Burnett, Mrs. Wallace, Mrs. Seibert, Mrs. Wright, Mrs. Reed, Mrs. Hockinson,
                    Mrs. Brown, Mrs. McDowell, Mrs. McLellan, Mrs. Herchberger and numerous others
                    gave up many days to the care of the sick and wounded. These were not all
                    assigned to one place. Patients were cared for in the King Street Hospital, the
                    Court House, the Academy, a number of the Churches, and in private homes. [begin
                    page 440] The ladies worked in pairs and had certain days for duty. Nor was this
                    all. In the interum [sic] the ladies worked in making things to be used in the
                    hospitals -- sheets, night shirts, pillows, pillow cases, carpet slippers,
                    towels, handkerchiefs and bandages head to be made and all this work was done
                    without delay and no word of complaint.</p>
<p>One of the great achievements for the cause was the fair held in Franklin Hall in
                    June 1864. The gross receipts were nearly 5000 dollars and the proceeds were
                    devoted to the furthering of the good work.</p>
<p>A unique feature of this Fair was the old Folks Concert which was a great
                    success. The program was as follows:</p>
<p>The "Old Folks" first Grand Concert, Franklin Hall, Chambersburg on Friday
                    Evening, June 17th, 1864. For the benefit of the U. S. Christian Commission.

<p>And so the good work went on, but I have neither the time nor ability to properly
                    describe all the great work done by the women of Franklin County in the time of
                    war.</p>
<p>I have purposely omitted the two greatest occasions in Chambersburg's Civil War
                    History -- the visit of Lee to the town and the Raid of McCauslin which resulted
                    in the entire destruction of Chambersburg.</p>
<p>The writer had a most pleasing interview with the Misses Bard, now living in
                    town. During the Civil War they lived on the site of the old post office
                    building now occupied by Broome and Meekin. The late Justice John Stewart lived
                    next door where the Valley National Bank is now situated. These ladies lived in
                    a place where all the most exciting events took place. Their brother, Cephas,
                    saw service with 126th Pennsylvania Regiment and another brother also served in
                    the Union Army.</p>
<p>Their description of Lee's entrance of Chambersburg his meeting with Gen. Hill on
                    the square, the demands that were made for provisions and all the little
                    incidents connected with Lee's visit are most interesting. Most of the
                    Confederates were encamped in Messersmith's Woods but others were camped in
                    town. Several used the porch and pavement in front of the Bard home. They built
                    great fires in front of the Court House and pilaged [sic] all the provisions
                    they could find. The food proposition became so serious that Mrs. McLellan took
                    matters in her own hands and went to Gen. Lee, himself, with a request that the
                    devastation be prohibited. As a result of this visit, Gen. Lee ordered the
                    demands cut down. Chambersburg depended for food upon the rural districts and
                    all the horses of the neighboring farmers had either been taken by the
                    Confederate Soldiers or secreted in the [begin page 442] mountains to prevent
                    their theft. This brought about a serious food shortage and added to, the misery
                    of the unfortunate citizens of Chambersburg.</p>
<p>However, the invasion of General Lee was not to be compared with the raid of
                    McCauslin. At the tithe of that raid, Mrs. Bard was alone in their home. Her
                    neighbor, John Stewart was acting as town Mayor and he and his family were
                    visiting in Shippensburg. Mrs. Bard knew of the invasion of the raiders and of
                    their threats to burn the town, but that was an old story to the women of
                    Chambersburg and she went about her routine duties. In the early hours of the
                    morning she saw several officers and men on the Stewart porch. One officer she
                    recognized as Gilmore and the other she thought was Gen. McCauslin. When no one
                    responded to the knocking the Confederates began hammering on the door to knock
                    it down. Mrs. Bard informed them that Mr. Stewart was away and one of the
                    officers replied, "He had better be here and you had better be away, for we are
                    going to burn the town." This time the threat was carried out and inflammable
                    material was carried to the Court House and the building fired. The Confederates
                    then divided intro squads and entered the houses, setting fire to the beds and
                    furniture, paying no attention to the sick or aged, and acting like the
                    barbarians they proved themselves to be. All these things are told so ably in a
                    umber [sic] of publications that I feel unable to add to what has already been
                    told. The great suffering of the women of Chambersburg in these times will have
                    to be told by abler writers than I. Sufficient to say that her heroic work
                    inspired the boys in blue to deeds of valor which resulted in ultimate Victory.</p>
<p>The things that make a soldier great and send him out to die, <br> To face the
                    framing cannons mouth, nor ever question why <br> Are lilacs by a little porch,
                    the row of tulips red; <br> The peonies and pansies, too, the old petunia bed;
                    <br> The grass plot where his children play, the roses on the wall; [begin page
                    443] <br> 'Tis these that make a soldier great, he's fighting for them all.
                    <br> 'Tis not the pomp and pride of kings that makes a soldier brave; <br>
                    'Tis not allegiance to the flag that over him may wave; <br> For soldiers never
                    fight so well on land or on the foam, <br> As when behind the cause they see
                    the little place called home. <br> Endanger but that humble street whereon his
                    children run, <br> You make a soldier of the man who never had a gun. <br>
                    What is it through the battle smoke the valient [sic] soldier sees? <br> The
                    little garden far away, the budding apple trees, <br> The little patch of
                    ground back there, the children at their play, <br> The golden thread of
                    courage isn't linked to castle dome; <br> But to the spot, where-er it be --
                    the humble spot called home. <br> And now the lilacs bud again and all is
                    lovely there, <br> And homesick soldiers far away know spring is in the air;
                    <br> The tulips come to bloom again, the grass once more is green, <br> And
                    every man can see the spot, where all his joys have been, <br> He sees his
                    children smile at him, he heats the bugle call, <br> And only death can stop
                    him now -- he's fighting for them all.</p>
