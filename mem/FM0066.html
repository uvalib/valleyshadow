<h3 class="section-head">Franklin County: "The Burning of Chambersburg," by Unknown, August 2,
                            1870</h3>
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> Marking the sixth anniverary of the burning of Chambersburg, the Franklin
                    newspaper included a detailed, still angry, first-person account of the burning.
                    Thus there was still bitterness, part of the legacy of the wartime burning.</p>
<p>On Saturday last, the 30th of July, was the sixth anniverary of the burning of
                    Chambersburg at the hands of the rebel incendiary, M'Causland, and his horde. On
                    the morning of that day, just six years ago, twenty-six hundred rebel veterans
                    (cavalry) occupied the out-posts of Chambersburg, in
                    supporting distance of the four or five hundred delegated and commanded to apply
                    the torch. Promiscuous plundering was indulged in by the soldiery from the hour
                    of the possession of the place until the command was given for applying the
                    torch. We were one of a party of eight--T. B. Kennedy, Wm. M'Lellan, J. M'D. Sharpe, Dr. J. C.
                    Richards, W. H. McDowell, W. S. Everett and E. G. Etter, who were ordered under
                    arrest, and held for the raising of five hundred thousand dollars in greenbacks,
                    or one hundred thousand dollars in gold, failing to do which in fifteen minutes,
                    we were to be taken to Richmond and the town burned. Dr. Richards informed the rebel general that it was out of the question
                    to comply with the demand, when the general (Gilmore) said that we could
                    "consider ourselves released for the present but to report again to head-quarters in twenty minutes." The party didn't
                    report. The enemy were stationed and appropriated over the town with torch in
                    hand, ready for the order to burn, whish was now given.
                    In fifteen minutes smoke might be seen arising from buildings in every
                    direction, and in half an hour the heart of the town was one body of flames.</p>
<p>We shall not attempt a picture of the horrid scenes that followed. All here are
                    familiar with these heart-sickening details. As a summary of what was done, we
                    give the following from Dr. Schneck's history of the "Burning of Chambersburg."
                    "Residences and places of business consumed, 278; various other buildings, 271;
                    total number of buildings consumed, 549. In a few hours, the major
                    portion of Chambersburg, its chief wealth and business, its capital and
                    elegance, were devoured by a barbarous foe; three millions of property
                    sacrificed; three thousand beings homeless and many of them penniless; and all
                    without so much as a pretence that the citizens of
                    the doomed town, or any of them had violated any accepted rule of civilized
                    warfare. Such is the deliberate, voluntary record made by Gen.Earley, a corps commander in the
                    insurgent army."</p>
