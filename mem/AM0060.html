<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> Brief passage from interview of Staunton ex-slave; discusses selling of family
                    members</p>
<p>MRS. MARY E.-WSEY (b. ?)<br> 674 E. Beverly St.,
                    Staunton, Va.<br> Interviewer: Susie R. C.

<p>My mother belong to William H. and Susan Marshall. She was born 1835. Mary Grason
                    she was-</p>
<p>While I was out at the home place where my mother belonged on the plantation I
                    was looking in the book case and came across that book and I wouldn't take
                    anything for finding it.</p>
<p>Just think when they died (white folks) they didn't have dresses on back. Son in
                    law gave them clothes.</p>
<p>Yes, they were good when you could work but when you got sick they sold you.</p>
<p>I had an aunt took fever in war time-left her feeble minded. She wandered off
                    sometimes. They sold her. They knew at big house traders was coming-kept it from
                    her. Answer was, when they broke news to her she said, she just as soon belong
                    to one white man as another. Tole us all good by like she was going on a visit. We never saw her no
                more.</p>
