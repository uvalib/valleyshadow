<h3 class="section-head">Augusta County: "R.E. Lee to W.W. Corcoran," by Robert E. Lee,
                            October 9, 1869 to August 23, 1870</h3>
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> This is a series of letters from Robert E. Lee to Hon. W. W. Corcoran. Lee
                    discusses raising money for Washington College. He also mentions his own ill
                    health during the winter of 1869-70. And in response to the Franco-Prussian War,
                    Lee laments human nature and its tendency toward violence and war. Lee does,
                    though, mention his own sympathies for a "warlike people" that seeks to "drive
                    invaders from their land."</p>
<p>LEXINGTON, VA., 9th October, 1869.</p>
<p>My Dear Mr. Corcoran-I have received this morning your note, of the 7th instant,
                    transmitting the assignment of Mr. Peabody of his claim against Virginia, with a
                    copy of Mr. Russell's note to you. I am truly grateful to Mr. Peabody for his
                    generous gift to Washington College, which, I hope, will result in much good to
                    the people of the State and in honor to him; and I am greatly thankful to you
                    and Mr. Russell for your interest and kind offices in the matter. Will you add
                    to my obligations by giving me your advice as to how to proceed to realize the
                    donation? I do not propose to indulge in intemperate haste, nor do I think it
                    advisable to approach the Legislature before it is organized, under the
                    constitution which has been adopted, for general business-it being understood to
                    be now in session for a specific purpose and for the fulfillment of the laws of
                    Congress on the subject of reconstruction. I wish, also, in presenting the claim
                    not to offend the sentiment of the people, and to obtain the aid of the leading
                    men of the State. Perhaps it would be well, to wait for Mr. Peabody's memorial
                    and other papers, or shall I endeavor to obtain them from the files of the
                    Legislature at Richmond?</p>
<p>With true regard, sincerely yours, R. E. LEE.</p>
<p>Hon. W. W. CORCORAN.</p>
<p>LEXINGTON, VA., 26th January, 1870.</p>
<p>My Dear Mr. Corcoran-I am very sorry that I cannot attend the funeral obsequies
                    of Mr. Peabody. It would be some relief to witness the respect paid to his
                    remains and to participate in commemorating his virtues; but I am unable to
                    undertake the journey. I have been sick all the winter and am still under
                    medical treatment. I particularly regret that I shall not have the pleasure of
                    seeing you. Mr. Cyrus McCormick, Colonel Christian and Major Kirkpatrick,
                    trustees of Washington College, will represent it on the occasion. They will
                    assemble at Mr. McCormick's house, No. 40 Fifth
                    Avenue, New York, and will probably not leave before the end of this week. I
                    wish you would join them, as I know they would be happy of your company. Please
                    remember me to Mr. Thornton and Mr. and Mrs. Russell.</p>
<p>With great regard,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE</p>
<p>Hon. W. W. CORCORAN.</p>
<p>HOT SPRINGS, VA., 23d August, 1870.</p>
<p>My Dear Mr. Corcoran-It has been a source of regret to me this summer that I have
                    been unable to enjoy your company while you were in the mountains. As you have
                    left the <u>White</u>, I presume  your visit
                    to Virginia for this season is near its close and I see no prospect of my
                    meeting with you. I hope that you have been benefited by your visit to the
                    mountains and will return to your home refreshed and strengthened. My best
                    wishes accompany you wherever you are. I have been trying the effects of these
                    waters, by the advice of Dr. Buckler, and cannot now
                    perceive much change in my rheumatic symptoms, though I will only have been here
                    a fortnight to-morrow. I purpose leaving here Monday next, 29th, for Staunton,
                    for the purpose of attending a meeting of the stockholders of the Valley
                    Railroad Company. They have been disappointed in obtaining from the county of
                    Augusta its subscription to the road, and have to devise ways and means of
                    making up its quota of $300,000 before they can receive the benefit of the
                    subscription of the city of Baltimore and of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad
                    Company. They have an impression that, as president of the company, I can assist
                    them, and I have been so strongly urged on the subject, that, if elected, I will
                    accept and serve them as well as I can. I do not think they ought, however, to
                    put me on these "forlorn hope" expeditions. I have served my turn.</p>
<p>I have watched, with much anxiety, the progress of the war between France and
                    Germany, and without going into the merits of the question at issue, or
                    understanding the necessity of the recourse to arms, I have regretted that they
                    did not submit their differences to the arbitration of the other Powers, as
                    provided in the articles of the treaty of Paris of 1856. It would have been a
                    grand moral victory over the passions of men, and would have so elevated the
                    contestants in the eyes of the present and future generations as to have
                    produced a beneficial effect. It might have been expecting, however, too much
                    from the present standard of civilization, and I fear we are destined to kill
                    and slaughter each other for ages to come. You have, in addition, personal
                    anxieties in the result, and the natural feeling lest your children should be
                    mixed up in its complication. As far as I can read the accounts, the French have
                    met with serious reverses, which seem to have demoralized the nation, and are
                    therefore alarming. Whatever may be the issue, I cannot help sympathizing with
                    the struggles of a warlike people to drive invaders from their land.</p>
<p>Wishing you all health and every happiness,<br> I am, most truly and sincerely,
                    yours,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE.</p>
<p>Mr. W. W. CORCORAN.</p>
