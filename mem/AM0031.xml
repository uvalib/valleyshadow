                <p>The dear old army had passed away from me forever, and I had been through the
                    Confederacy. It was the last week of the war. <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr>
                    Lee's army was camped near Petersburg, and I had been there all winter, at Mrs.
                    Richard Kidder Meade's, to be near my husband, who was medical director of the
                    Army of Northern Virginia and on <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Lee's staff.
                    Agnes Lee had been on a visit at Mrs. Meade's, but left Saturday morning for
                    Richmond. Sunday morning I was dressed for church, when my ambulance drove up to
                    Mrs. Meade's door, and old Wilson, my faithful old soldier driver who had always
                    driven my ambulance, gave me a note from my husband saying: "The enemy are
                    entering Richmond. I do not wish to leave you within their lines. Wilson will
                    know where to take you." I mmediately put some necessary articles in a small
                    trunk and had it put in the ambulance, got in, and Wilson drove off. All that
                    day and all that night we drove and drove. I do not remember eating, but I do
                    know I slept. Once in the night I awoke and heard sounds of sorrow, and was told
                    that they were from Mrs. A. P. Hill's ambulance, and that <abbr expan="General"
                        >Gen.</abbr> Hill had been killed just before our army left Petersburg.</p>
                <p>Well, we went on and on. Occasionally I saw my husband and other officers would
                    ride up and say: "Mrs. Guild, we have no command; we will rally around your
                    ambulance." Our poor soldiers would come to me and ask for food, and know I had
                    none to give; but each day my husband, I suppose, would manage to get me
                    something to eat, for I was never hungry. Often on that march my husband or some
                    other officer would ride up hurriedly and speak to old Wilson, and he would whip
                    up the mules, and we would rush across fields in any direction. It would be
                    because the enemy had cut our lines. Finally <abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr>
                    Baldwin, of <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Lee's staff, came to me and gave
                    me fifty dollars in greenbacks-the first, I believe, I ever had. He said he did
                    not know what would happen, and I might need it; but I was so young and
                    thoughtless in those days I did not dream of danger or surrender. I was even
                    happy on that dreadful march; everything was so strange. I was the only lady. My
                    husband would often ride up to my ambulance and cheer me in every way he could.
                    At last, one evening at sunset, my ambulance stopped, Wilson saying he had
                    orders to halt. By and by several officers came up, and soon the baggage-wagons.
                    My husband order his servant, Nathan, whom he had brought from the old
                    plantation, and who had been with him through the war, to get out his best
                    clothes. He and other officers dressed themselves in their best. I asked <abbr
                        expan="Doctor">Dr.</abbr> Guild why it was, and he replied that they might
                    be captured, and wanted to make a good appearance. Then my husband went with me
                    to a house near by, where I refreshed myself. Returning to the ambulance, I
                    found all the officers lying around on the ground, with their military cloaks
                    thrown over their faces, asleep in the moonlight. It was a strange sight. I got
                    in my ambulance, and was soon asleep myself. When I awoke it was daylight, and
                    we were moving. Soon my husband came to me and said there might be a fight
                    there, but that I was in no danger, and must not be frightened. He took me out
                    of the ambulance and put me in a gully, barricaded it with wagons, and told old
                    Wilson to keep the ambulance ready, so he could put me in it, and where to take
                    me if certain things happened; but just then an officer rode up and said there
                    was a house a mile off, and my husband put me in the ambulance and took me
                    there. It was the home of <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Morton, and he made
                    me welcome, and took me to a room on the first floor, where my husband bade me
                    good-by and returned to <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Lee. He had hardly
                    left me, when a body of our men and a party of the enemy met in a skirmish in
                    front of my room. When it was over I laid my hat, watch, and chain off, and went
                    to bathe my face, just as my door was burst open and a Dutch soldier, with
                    pistol in hand, came in, cursing the Rebels. I said not a word, but quietly left
                    the room. I found the whole house filled with soldiers. I saw an officer, and
                    told him what had happened, and he instantly went with me. I found my watch and
                    chain gone, but was too glad to escape with that to murmur. I heard that <abbr
                        expan="General">Gen.</abbr> John Gibbon, who used to be a dear old army
                    friend, was near,<pb n="12"/> and I asked if I could send him a note.
                    Immediately a man was sent with my little pencilled note to <abbr
                        expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Gibbon, and quickly a reply came, saying he
                    would come to me; and he came even while I was reading his note, the same kind
                    old friend. He put a safe guard around the house; but, notwithstanding that, the
                    next morning a negro soldier came to my room, but, as they had always been my
                    slaves, I did not feel afraid of him. I ordered him out, and he went. Our little
                    Indian boy, Joe, whom we had since he was seven years old (then twelve), was
                    with me. Then my husband came and told me of the surrender, and he broke
                    completely down when he spoke of <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Lee.</p>
                <p>Well, we left Appomattox Court-House. My ambulance followed <abbr expan="General"
                        >Gen.</abbr> Lee's, which was empty, he riding with his staff and those of
                    the army who went with him to Richmond. I shall never forget how, as <abbr
                        expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Lee rode away from Appomattox the Union soldiers
                    cheered and cheered him. He was grander to me on that sad march back to Richmond
                    than he ever was after one of his great victories. Often on that march he would
                    come to my ambulance early in the morning with a cup of coffee, depriving
                    himself for the only woman who was on that sorrowful, hopeless march. We would
                    all, from the highest officer to the humblest soldier, have given him our last
                    drop of water or food, we loved him so; and on that march, when we would camp
                    near a house, they would prepare their best for <abbr expan="General"
                    >Gen.</abbr> Lee; but he would sleep in his tent or on the ground with his
                    staff, and say that I must go and have what was prepared for him. How provoked
                    they must have felt to see a forlorn little woman, instead of <abbr
                        expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Lee! When we reached Richmond we all separated.
                    I never saw <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Lee again, but my husband went
                    back to Richmond to see him; and now I feel sure they are not very far apart in
                    heaven. And for me,</p>
                <p>Would those hours could come again, with their thorns and flowers!<lb/> I would
                    give the hopes of years for those bygone hours.</p>
