<h3 class="section-head">Augusta County: "Stonewall Jackson in the Shenandoah," by John D.
                            Imboden, June 1885</h3>
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> A praise-filled account of Stonewall Jackson's efforts in the Shenandoah.</p>
<p>INCLUDING HIS RELATIONS TO THE PENINSULAR CAMPAIGN</p>
<p>The movement to capture Harper's Ferry and the fire-arms manufactured and stored
                    there was organized at the Exchange Hotel in Richmond on the night of April 16,
                    1861. Ex-Governor Henry A. Wise was at the head of this purely impromptu affair.
                    The Virginia Secession Convention, then sitting, was by a large majority "Union"
                    in its sentiments till Sumter was fired on and captured, and Mr. Lincoln called
                    for 75,000 men to enforce the laws in certain Southern States. Virginia was
                    then, as it is were, forced to "take sides," and she did not hesitate. I had
                    been one of the candidates for a seat in that Convention from Augusta County but
                    was overwhelmingly defeated by the "Union" candidates, because I favored
                    secession as the only "peace measure" Virginia could then adopt, our aim being
                    to put ourselves in an independent position to negotiate between the United
                    States and the seceded Gulf and Cotton States for a new Union, to be formed on a
                    compromise of the slavery question by a convention to be held for that purpose.</p>
<p>Late on April 15 I received a telegram from "Nat" Tayler, the editor of the
                    "Richmond Enquirer," summoning me to Richmond, where I arrived the next day.
                    Before reaching the Exchange Hotel I met ex-Governor Wise on the street. He
                    asked me to find as many officers of the armed and equipped volunteers of the
                    inland towns and counties as I could, and request them to be at the hotel by
                    seven in the evening to confer about a military movement which he deemed
                    important. Not many such officers were in town, but I found Captains Turner
                    Ashby and Richard Ashby of Fauquier County, Oliver R. Funsten of Clarke County,
                    all commanders of volunteer companies of cavalry; also Captain John A. Harman of
                    Staunton-my home-and Alfred Barbour, the latter  ex-civil
                    superintendent of the Government works at Harper's Ferry.</p>
<p>These persons, with myself, promptly joined ex-Governor Wise, and a plan for the
                    capture of Harper's Ferry was at once discussed and settled upon. The movement,
                    it was agreed, should commence the next day, the 17th, as soon as the Convention
                    voted to secede,-provided we could get railway transportation and the
                    concurrence of Governor Letcher. Colonel Edmund Fontaine, president of the
                    Virginia Central Railroad, and John S. Barbour, president of the Orange and
                    Alexandria and Manassas Gap railroads, were sent for, and joined us at the hotel
                    near midnight. They agreed to put the necessary trains in readiness next day to
                    obey any request of Governor Letcher for the movement of troops.</p>
<p>A committee, of which I was chairman, waited on Governor Letcher after midnight,
                    arousing him from his bed, and laid the scheme before him. He stated that he
                    would take no step till officially informed that the ordinance of secession was
                    passed by the Convention. He was then asked if contingent upon the event he
                    would next day order the movement by telegraph. He consented. We then informed
                    him what companies would be under arms ready to move at a moment's notice. All
                    the persons I have named above are now dead, except John S. Barbour (who is in
                    Congress), "Nat" Tyler, and myself.</p>
<p>On returning to the hotel and reporting Governor Letcher's promise, it was
                    decided to telegraph the captains of companies along the railroads mentioned to
                    be ready next day for orders from the Governor. In that way I ordered the
                    Staunton Artillery, which I commanded, to assemble at their armory by 4 P. M. on
                    the 17th, to receive orders from the Governor to aid in the capture of
                    Portsmouth Navy Yard. This destination had been indicated in all our dispatches
                    to decive the Government at Washington, in case there should be a "leak" in the
                    telegraph offices. Early in the evening a message had been received by
                    ex-Governor Wise from his son-in-law Doctor Garnett of Washington, to the effect
                    that a Massachusetts regiment, one thousand strong, had been ordered to Harper's
                    Ferry. Without this reenforcement we knew the
                    guard there consisted of only about thirty men, who could be captured or driven
                    away, perhaps without firing a shot, if we could reach the place secretly with a
                    considerable force.</p>
<p>The Ashbys, Funsten, Harman and I, remained up the entire night. The
                    superintendent and commandant of the Virginia Armory at Richmond, Captain
                    Charles Dimmock, a Northern man by birth and a West Point graduate, was in full
                    sympathy with us, and that night filled our requisitions for ammunition, and
                    moved it to the railway station before sunrise. He also granted one hundred
                    stand of arms for the Martinsburg Light Infantry, a new company just formed. All
                    these I receipted for and saw placed on the train. Just before we moved out of
                    the depot, ex-Superintendent Barbour made an unguarded remark in the car, which
                    was overheard by a Northern traveler who immediately wrote a message to
                    President Lincoln and paid a negro a dollar to take it to the telegraph office.
                    This act was discovered by one of our party, who induced a friend to follow the
                    negro and take the dispatch from him. This perhaps prevented troops being sent
                    to head us off.</p>
<p>My telegram to Staunton Artillery produced wild excitement, that spread rapidly
                    through the county, and brought thousands of people to Staunton during the day.
                    Augusta had been a strong Union county, and a doubt was raised by some whether I
                    was acting under the orders of Governor Letcher. To satisfy them, my brother,
                    George W. Imboden, sent a message to me at Gordonsville, inquiring under whose
                    authority I had acted. On the arrival of the train at Gordonsville, Captain
                    Harman received the message and replied to it in my name, that I was acting by
                    order of the Governor. Harman had been of the committee, the night before, that
                    waited on Governor Letcher, and he assumed that by that hour-noon-the Convention
                    must have voted the State out of the Union, and that the Governor had kept his
                    promise to send orders by wire. Before we reached Staunton. Harman handed me the
                    dispatch and told me what he had done. I was annoyed by his action till the
                    train drew up at Staunton, where thousands of people were assembled, and my
                    artillery company and the West Augusta Guards (the finest infantry company in
                    the Valley) were in line. Major-General Kenton Harper, a native of Pennsylvania,
                    "a born soldier," and Brigadier-General William H. Harman, both holding
                    commissions in the Virginia militia,-and both of whom had won their spurs in the
                    regiment the State had sent to the Mexican war,-met me, as I alighted, with a
                    telegram from Governor Letcher, ordering them into service and referring them to
                    me for information as to our destination and troops. Until I confidentially
                    imparted to them all that had occurred the night before, they thought, as did
                    all the people assembled, that we were bound for the Portsmouth Navy Yard. For
                    prudential reasons we said nothing to dispel the illusion. The Governor in his
                    dispatch informed General Harper that he  was to take chief
                    command, and that full written instructions would reach him <u>en route</u>. He waited till after dark, and then set
                    out for Winchester behind a good team. Brigadier-General Harman was ordered to
                    take command of the trains and of all troops that might report <u>en route</u>.</p>
<p>About sunset we took train; our departure was an exciting and affecting scene. On
                    the east side of the Blue Ridge a slide caused some delay. At Charlottesville,
                    in the night, the Monticello Guards, a fine company under Captain R. T. W. Duke
                    (since the war a member of Congress), came aboard. At Culpeper, a rifle company
                    - the name of whose commander that night I had forgotten - also joined us, and
                    just as the sun rose on the 18th of April we reached Manassas Junction.</p>
<p>The Ashbys and Funsten had gone on the day before to collect their cavalry
                    companies, and also the famous "Black Horse Cavalry," a superb body of men and
                    horses under Captains John Scott and Welby Carter of Fauqiuer. By marching
                    across the Blue Ridge, they were to rendezvous near Harper's Ferry. Ashby had
                    sent men on the night of the 17th to cut the wires between Manassas and
                    Alexandria, and to keep them cut for several days.</p>
<p>Our advent at Manassas astounded the quiet people of the village. General Harman
                    at once "impressed" the Manassas Gap train to take the lead, and switched two or
                    three other trains to that line in order to proceed to Strasburg. I was put in
                    command of the foremost train, and had not gone five miles when I discovered
                    that the engineer could not be trusted. He let his fire go down, and came to a
                    dead standstill on a slight ascending grade. I ran forward and found the
                    engineer under his engine. He alleged that something was wrong, and was using a
                    monkey wrench to take bolts out of the reversing links. An engineer from the
                    next train, which was close behind, came up, and looking at the steam-gauge
                    swore the fire was out, and nothing else the matter. As soon as he saw the
                    engineer of my train he denounced him as a Northern man. A cocked pistol induced
                    him to fire up and go ahead. From there to Strasburg I rode in the engine-cab,
                    and we made full forty miles an hour with the aid of good dry wood and a navy
                    revolver.</p>
<p>At Strasburg we disembarked, and before ten o'clock the infantry companies took
                    up the line of march for Winchester. I had to procure horses for my guns. The
                    farmers were in their corn-fields. Some of them agreed to hire us horses as far
                    as Winchester, eighteen miles, and other refused. The situation being urgent, we
                    took the horses by force, under threats of being indicted by the first grand
                    jury to meet in the county. By noon we had sufficient teams and followed the
                    infantry down the Valley turnpike, reaching Winchester just at nightfall. The
                    people generally received us very coldly. The war-spirit that bore them up
                    through four years of trial and privation had not yet been aroused.</p>
<p>General Harper was at Winchester, and had sent forward his infantry by rail to
                    Charlestown, eight miles from Harper's Ferry. In a short time a train returned
                    for my battery. The farmers got their horses and went home rejoicing, and we set
                    out for the Ferry. The infantry moved out of Charlestown about midnight. We kept
                    to our train as far as Halltown, only four miles from the Ferry. There we
                    disembarked our guns to be run forward by hand to Bolivar Heights or Furnace
                    Hill, from which we could shell the place if necessary.</p>
<p>A little before day-dawn a brilliant light arose from near the point of
                    confluence of the Shenandoah and Potomac rivers. General Harper, who up to that
                    moment had expected a conflict with the Massachusetts regiment supposed to be
                    Harper's Ferry, was making his dispositions for an attack at daybreak, when this
                    light convinced him that the enemy had fired the arsenal and fled. He marched in
                    and took possession, but too late to extinguish the flames. Nearly twenty
                    thousand rifles and pistols were destroyed. The workshops had not been fired.
                    The people of the town told us the catastrophe, for such it was to us, was owing
                    to declarations made the day before by ex-Superintendent Alfred Barbour, who was
                    popular with the workmen. He reached Harper's Ferry, <u>via</u> Washington, on the 18th about noon, when the mechanics in the works
                    had knocked off for dinner. Collecting them in groups, he informed them that the
                    place would be captured within twenty-four hours by Virginia troops. He urged
                    them to protect the property, and join the Southern cause, promising, if war
                    ensued, that the place would be held by the South, and they would be continued
                    at work on high wages. His influence with the men was great, and most of them
                    decided to accept his advice. But Lieutenant Roger Jones, who commanded the
                    little guard of some thirty men, hearing what was going on, at once took
                    measures to destroy the place if necessary. Trains of gunpowder were laid
                    through the buildings to be fired. In the shops the men of Southern sympathies
                    managed to wet the powder in many places during the night, rendering it
                    harmless. Jones's troops, however, held the arsenal buildings and stores, and
                    when advised of Harper's rapid approach from Charlestown, the gunpowder was
                    fired, and he crossed into Maryland with his handful of men. So we secured  only the machinery, and the burnt gun and pistol barrels and
                    locks, which, however, were sent to Richmond and Columbia, South Carolina, and
                    were worked over into excellent arms.</p>
<p>Within a week about thirteen hundred rank and file of the Virginia volunteers had
                    assembled there. As these companies were, in fact, a part of the State militia,
                    they were legally under command of the three brigadiers and one major-general of
                    militia, who had authority over this, that, or the other organization. These
                    generals surrounded themselves with a numerous staff, material for which was
                    abundant in the rank and file of the volunteers; for instance, in my battery
                    there were at least a dozen college graduates of and below the grade of
                    corporal. Every fair afternoon the official display in Harper's Ferry of "fuss
                    and feathers" would have done no discredit to the Champs Elysees.</p>
<p>One afternoon, six or eight days after our occupation, General Harper sent for me
                    as the senior artillery officer (we then had three batteries, but all without
                    horses) to say he had been told that a number of trains on the Baltimore and
                    Ohio railroad would try to pass us in the night, transporting troops from the
                    West to Washington, and that he had decided to prevent them at the risk of
                    bringing on a battle. He ordered the posting of guns so as to command the road
                    for half a mile or more, all to be accurately trained on the track by the light
                    of day, and loaded ready to be discharged at any moment. Infantry companies were
                    stationed to fire into the trains, if the artillery failed to stop them. Pickets
                    were posted out two or three miles, with orders to fire signal-guns as soon as
                    the first troop-laden train should pass. About one o'clock at night we heard the
                    rumbling of an approaching train. The long roll was beat; the men assembled at
                    their assigned positions and in silence awaited the sound of the signal-guns. A
                    nervous cavalryman was the vedette. As the train passed by (it was the regular
                    mail) he thought he saw soldiers in it and fired. <u>Pop!
                        pop! pop!</u> came down the road from successive sentries. Primers were
                    inserted and lanyards were taut, to be pulled when the engine turned a certain
                    point four hundred yards distant from the battery. By great good luck Colonel
                    William S. H. Baylor, commanding the Fifth Virginia regiment, was with some of
                    his men stationed a little beyond the fatal point, and seeing no troops aboard
                    the train signaled it to stop. It did so, not one hundred yards beyond where the
                    artillery would have opened on it. When the first excitement was over, he
                    demanded of the conductor what troops, if any, were on board, and was told there
                    was "one old fellow in uniform asleep on the mail-bags in the first car."
                    Entering the car with a file of soldiers, he secured the third prisoner of war
                    taken in Virginia. It proved to be Brig.-Gen. W. S. Harney of the United States Army, on his way from the
                    West to Washington, to resign his commission and go to Europe rather than engage
                    in a fratricidal war. He surrendered with a pleasant remark, and was taken to
                    General Harper's headquarters, where he spent the night. On his assurance that
                    he knew of no troops coming from the West, Harper ordered us all to quarters.
                    Next morning General Harney was paroled to report in Richmond, and was escorted
                    to a train about to leave for Winchester. He was a fine-looking old soldier, and
                    as he walked down the street to the depot he saw all our forces, except the
                    cavalry. He was accompanied socially by two or three of our generals with a
                    swarm of staff-officers. He cast his eagle glance over the few hundred men in
                    sight, and turning to General Harper, I heard him inquire, with a merry twinkle
                    in his eye, "Where is your army encamped, General?" Harper's fact crimsoned and
                    he replied, "Excuse me from giving information." Harney smiled, and politely
                    said, "Pardon me for asking an improper question, but I had forgotten I was a
                    prisoner." He went on to Richmond, was treated with marked courtesy, and in a
                    day or two proceeded to Washington.</p>
<p>In a few days our forces began to increase by the arrival of fresh volunteer
                    companies. Being only a captain, I was kept very busy in trying to get my
                    battery into the best condition. We had no caissons and insufficient harness.
                    For the latter I sent to Baltimore, purchasing on my private credit. In the same
                    way I ordered from Richmond red flannel shirts and other clothing for all my
                    men, our uniforms being too fine for camp life. The Governor subsequently
                    ordered these bills to be paid by the State Treasurer. We found at the armory a
                    large number of very strong horse-carts. In my battery were thirty or more
                    excellent young mechanics. By using the wheels and axles of the carts they soon
                    constructed good caissons, which served us till after the first battle of Bull
                    Run.</p>
<p>We had no telegraph line to Richmond, and the time of communication by mail was
                    two days. General Harper found it so difficult to obtain needed munitions and
                    supplies, that about the last day of April he decided to send me to the
                    Governor, who was my intimate friend, with a requisition for all we needed, and
                    verbal instructions to make to him a full statement of our necessitous and
                    defenseless condition, in case General Patterson, who was with a Federal force
                    at Chambersburg, should move against us. When I arrived in Rich-
                    mond, General Robert E. Lee had been placed in command of all the Virginia
                    forces by the Convention, and by ordinance every militia officer in the State
                    above the rank of captain had been decapitated, and the Governor and his
                    military council had been authorized to fill vacancies thus created. This was a
                    disastrous blow to "the pomp and circumstance of glorious war" at Harper's
                    Ferry. Militia generals and the brilliant "staff" were stricken down, and their
                    functions devolved, according to Governor Letcher's order of April 27, upon
                    Thomas J. Jackson, colonel commandant, and James W. Massie, major and assistant
                    adjutant-general, who arrived during the first week of May.</p>
<p>This was "Stonewall" Jackson's first appearance on the theater of the war. I
                    spent one day and night in Richmond, and then returned to camp, arriving about 2
                    P. M. What a revolution three or four days had wrought! I could scarcely realize
                    the change. The militia generals were all gone; the staff had vanished. The
                    commanding colonel and his adjutant had arrived, and were occupying a small room
                    in the little wayside hotel near the railroad bridge. Knowing them both, I
                    immediately sought an interview and delivered a letter and some papers I had
                    brought from General Lee. Jackson and his adjutant were at a little pine table
                    figuring upon the rolls of the troops present. They were dressed in well-worn,
                    dingy uniforms of professors in the Virginia Military Institute, where both had
                    recently occupied chairs. Colonel Jackson had issued and sent to the camps a
                    short, simple order assuming the command, but had had no intercourse with the
                    troops. The deposed officers had nearly all left for home or for Richmond in a
                    high state of indignation. After an interview of perhaps a half hour I proceeded
                    to my camp on the hill, and found the men of the Fifth Virginia regiment, from
                    my own county, in assembly, and the greatly excited. They were deeply attached
                    to their field officers, and regarded the action of the Convention as an outrage
                    on freemen and volunteers, and were discussing the propriety of passing
                    denunciatory resolutions. On seeing me they called for a speech. As I did not
                    belong to the regiment, I declined to say anything, but ordered the men of the
                    Staunton Artillery to fall into line. Then I briefly told them that we were
                    required to muster into service either for twelve months or during the war, at
                    our option. I urged them to go in for the full period of the war, at our option.
                    I urged them to go in for the full period of the war, as such action would be
                    most creditable to them, and a good example to others. They unanimously shouted,
                    "For the war! For the war!" Before they were dismissed the ceremony of mustering
                    in was completed, and I proudly took the roll down to Colonel Jackson with the
                    remark, "There, Colonel, is the roll of your first company mustered in for the
                    war," He looked it over, and rising, shook my hand, saying, "Thank you, Captain
                    - thank you; and please thank your men for me." He had heard there was some
                    dissatisfaction in the camps, and asked me to act as mustering officer for the
                    two other artillery companies present. Before sunset the rolls were returned.
                    This prompt action of the batteries was emulated the next day by the other
                    troops, and all were mustered in. Within a week Governor Letcher very wisely
                    appointed Major-General Harper colonel of the Fifth Virginia, Brigadier-General
                    Harman lieutenant-colonel, and the late Colonel Baylor major, and I venture to
                    say no regiment in either army was ever better officered. The fame it won in the
                    "Stonewall" brigade proves this.</p>
<p>The presence of a master mind was visible in the changed condition of the camp.
                    Perfect order reigned. Instruction in all the details of military duties
                    occupied Jackson's whole time. He urged all officers to call upon him for
                    information about even the minutest details of duty, often remarking that it was
                    no discredit to a civilian to be ignorant of military matters. He was a rigid
                    disciplinarian, and yet as gentle and kind as a woman. He was the easiest man in
                    our army to get along with pleasantly so long as one did his duty, but as
                    inexorable as fate in exacting its performance; yet he would overlook serious
                    faults if he saw they were the result of ignorance, and in a kindly way would
                    instruct the offender. He was as courteous to the humblest private who sought an
                    interview for any purpose, as to the highest officer in his command. He despised
                    superciliousness and self-assertion, and nothing angered him so quickly as to
                    see an officer wound the feelings of those under him by irony or sarcasm.</p>
<p>When Jackson found we were without artillery horses, he went into no red-tape
                    correspondence with the circumlocution offices in Richmond, but ordered his
                    quartermaster, Major John A. Harman, to proceed with men to the Quaker
                    settlements in the rich county of Loudoun, famous for its good horses, and buy
                    or impress as many as we needed. Harman executed his orders with such energy and
                    dispatch that he won Jackson's confidence and remained his chief quartermaster
                    till the day of Jackson's death.</p>
<p>About ten days after Jackson assumed command at the Ferry, everything being
                    perfectly quiet, I rode up to his quarters and told him we had been so suddenly
                    called into service that I had left important private  business
                    unprovided for, and had written for my wife to bring papers needing my
                    signature; that I had received a note from Colonel Ware saying she was a guest
                    at his house, some seventeen miles from our camp. I said to the Colonel that I
                    knew of nothing to prevent my going to Colonel Ware's that night, and that I
                    would return by nine or ten o'clock next morning. I made no formal application
                    for leave of absence, and as he said nothing against my going, I mounted and
                    rode off. I reached Ware's in time for supper. A heavy rain-storm set in. About
                    two o'clock some one hallooed lustily at the front
                    gate. Raising the window, I called out, "Who is there?" My brother's voice
                    shouted back that he had an order from Colonel Jackson requiring me to report to
                    him at daybreak. This order had been sent to my camp at nine P. M. without
                    explanation, and my brother, not knowing that I had seen Colonel Jackson before
                    I left camp, thought my absence might compromise me, and therefore rode through
                    the storm to enable me to get back to camp before daylight. Of course, I
                    returned with him, reaching Harper's Ferry at early dawn, wet to the skin, and
                    very muddy. I went to headquarters and found Adjutant Massie up, but Colonel
                    Jackson had not risen. I inquired at once, "What news from the enemy?"
                    supposing, of course, that some trouble was impending. He replied, "Everything
                    is quiet." I pulled out the order and asked, "What does this mean?" He answered,
                    "It's plain: you are to report here at daybreak." "What for?" "I don't know, but
                    have only my suspicions." "What are they?" "That it is to teach you that a
                    soldier in the face of the enemy has no business away from his post." At this I
                    became very angry, and declared I would have an explanation when Jackson arose.</p>
<p>Massie and I had been intimate from boyhood. He said, "Let me advise you. You
                    don't know Jackson as I do. He is one of the best-hearted men in the world, and
                    the truest. He has the most rigid ideas of duty. He thought last night that you
                    went off in a rather free-and-easy manner. He likes you, and would not forbid
                    your going, though he gave you no leave to go. You assumed it. He meant to
                    rebuke you for it, and teach you a military lesson that you would not forget. He
                    sent this order to your camp last night, as if he supposed you were there. I am
                    glad it reached you, and that you are here. It will raise you and your brother
                    in his estimation." He advised me to cool down, get breakfast, and come back. "I
                    will tell him," he said, "that you have been here. He was up late last night, or
                    he would be out of bed now." I followed Massie's advice, and about eight o'clock
                    called on Colonel Jackson, and asked if he had any orders for me. He said he had
                    decided to take possession of the bridge across the Potomac at Point of Rocks,
                    twelve miles below Harper's Ferry, and wished me to command the post. He asked
                    how soon I could be ready to go. I replied, "In thirty minutes - just as soon as
                    we can harness the horses and hitch up." He saw I was still angry, but never
                    alluded to my recall from Ware's. He smiled at my prompt reply and said, "You
                    needn't be in such a hurry - it will do to get off by eleven o'clock." The
                    episode was soon the gossip of the camp, and, perhaps, had a salutary effect.</p>
<p>I fortified the Virginia end of the Point of Rocks bridge, as we expected a visit
                    any night from General B. F. Butler, who was at the Relay House on the Baltimore
                    and Ohio railroad. It was my habit to keep awake all night to be ready for
                    emergencies, and to sleep in the day-time, making daily reports, night and
                    morning, to Jackson.</p>
<p>One Sunday afternoon, a little over a week after we occupied this post, I was
                    aroused from my nap by one of my men, who said there were two men in blue
                    uniforms (we had not yet adopted the gray) riding about our camp, and looking so
                    closely at everything that he believed they were spies! I went out to see who
                    they were. It was Jackson and one of his staff. I approached them, he put his
                    finger on his lips and shook his head as a signal for silence. In a low tone he
                    said he preferred it should not be known he had come there. He approved of all I
                    had done, and soon galloped away. I afterward suspected the visit was simply to
                    familiarize himself with the line of the canal and railroad from Point of Rocks
                    to Harper's Ferry preparatory to a sharp bit of strategy he practiced a few days
                    later. One of the great and growing wants felt by the Confederacy from the very
                    beginning of the war was that of rolling-stock for the railroads. We were
                    particularly short of locomotives, and were without the shops to build them.
                    Jackson, appreciating this, hit upon a plan to obtain a large supply from the
                    Baltimore and Ohio road. Its line was double-tracked, at least from Point of
                    Rocks to Martinsburg, a distance of twenty-five or thirty miles.</p>
<p>By our occupation of Harper's Ferry we had not interfered with the running of
                    trains except on the occasion of the arrest of General Harney. The coal traffic
                    from Cumberland was immense, as the Washington Government was accumulating
                    supplies of coal on the seaboard. These coal trains passed Harper's Ferry at all
                    hours of the day and night,  and thus furnished Jackson a pretext
                    for arranging a brilliant "scoop." When he sent me to Point of Rocks, he ordered
                    Colonel Harper with the Fifth Virginia infantry to Martinsburg. He then
                    complained to President Garrett, of the Baltimore and Ohio, that the night
                    trains, eastward bound, disturbed the repose of his camp, and requested a change
                    of schedule that would pass all east-bound trains by Harper's Ferry between
                    eleven and one o'clock in the day-time. Mr. Garrett complied, and thereafter for
                    several days we heard the constant roar of passing trains for an hour before and
                    an hour after noon. But since the "empties" were sent up the road at night,
                    Jackson again complained that the nuisance was as great as ever, and as the road
                    has two tracks, he must insist that west-bound trains should pass Harper's Ferry
                    during the same two hours as those east-bound. Mr. Garrett promptly complied,
                    and we then had, for two hours every day, the liveliest railroad in America. As
                    soon as the scheduling was working at its best, Jackson sent me an order one
                    night to take a force of men across to the Maryland side of the river next day
                    at eleven o'clock, and let all west-bound trains pass till twelve o'clock but
                    permit none to go east, and at twelve o'clock, but permit none to go east, and
                    at twelve o'clock to obstruct the road so that it would require several days to
                    repair it. He ordered the reverse to be done at Martinsburg. Thus he caught all
                    the trains that were going east or west between those points, and ran them up to
                    Winchester, thirty-two miles on the branch road, where they were safe, and
                    whence they were removed by horse-power to Strasburg and Staunton. I do not
                    remember the number of trains captured, but the loss crippled the Baltimore and
                    Ohio road seriously for some time, and the gain to our scantily stocked Virginia
                    roads of the same gauge was invaluable.</p>
<p>While we held the Point of Rocks bridge, J. E. B. Stuart (afterwards so famous as
                    a cavalry leader) was commissioned lieutenant-colonel and reported to Colonel
                    Jackson for assignment to duty. Jackson ordered the consolidation of all the
                    cavalry companies into a battalion to be commanded by Stuart, who appeared then
                    more like a well-grown, manly youth than the matured man he really was. This
                    order was very offensive to Captain Turner Ashby, at that time the idol of all
                    the troopers in the field, as well he might be, for a more brave and chivalrous
                    officer never rode at the head of well-mounted troopers. Ashby was older than
                    Stuart, and he thought, and we all believed, he was entitled to first promotion.
                    When not absent scouting, Ashby spent his nights with me at the bridge, our
                    relations being confidential. He was unmarried and of a meditative temperament,
                    that sometimes made him gloomy. He often expressed the belief that he and his
                    fondly loved brother "Dick" Ashby would fall early in the conflict. The evening
                    upon which he received Colonel Jackson's order to report to Stuart he came to
                    the bridge from his camp, two miles out on the Leesburg road, and asked me to go
                    up on the bridge roof for a talk. He then told me of the order, and that he
                    would reply to it next morning with his resignation. I expostulated with him,
                    although he had all my sympathies. I urged him to call upon Colonel Jackson that
                    night. It was only twelve miles by the tow-path of the canal, and on his black
                    Arabian he could make it in less than an hour. I believed Jackson would respect
                    his feelings and leave his company out of Stuart's battalion. I ventured to
                    write a private letter to Jackson, appealing in the strongest terms for the
                    saving of Ashby to the service.</p>
<p>About ten o'clock, under a bright moonlight, the guards let Ashby through the
                    bridge, and in a lope he turned up the tow-path toward Harper's Ferry. In
                    crossing one of the little bridges over a waste-sluice, something frightened the
                    Arabian, and with a bound they landed in the canal. The water did not quite swim
                    the horse, but the banks were so steep that he could not get out of it till he
                    had ridden several hundred yards and found the bank less steep. Then on he went,
                    and reached Jackson's headquarters before he had retired. Jackson not only
                    relieved him from the obnoxious order, but agreed to divide the companies
                    between him and Stuart, and to ask for his immediate promotion, forming thus the
                    nuclei of two regiments of cavalry, to be filled as rapidly as new companies
                    came to the front. Ashby got back to Point of Rocks about two in the morning, as
                    happy as a man as I ever saw, and completely enraptured with Jackson. From that
                    night on their mutual affection and confidence were remarkable. He said his
                    night ride and ducking in the canal so excited Jackson's amusement and
                    admiration that he believed they did more than all else to secure the favorable
                    result of his visit. But it is more likely that a trip Ashby had made a few days
                    before to Chambersburg and the encampment of General Robert Patterson was the
                    real reason for Jackson's favor. Ashby had rigged himself in a farmer's suit of
                    homespun that he borrowed, and hiring a plow-horse, had personated a rustic
                    horse-doctor. With his saddle-bags full of some remedy for spavin or ringbone,
                    he had gone to Chambersburg, and had returned in the night with an immense
                    amount of information. The career of Ashby was a romance from that time on till
                    he fell, shot through the  heart, two days before the battle of
                    Cross Keys, of which I shall speak later on.</p>
<p>In May, 1861, Colonel Jackson was superseded in command at Harper's Ferry by
                    Brigadier-General Joseph E. Johnston. When General Johnston arrived, several
                    thousand men had been assembled there, representing nearly all the seceded
                    States east of the Mississippi River. Johnston at once began the work of
                    organization on a larger scale than Jackson had attempted. He brigaded the
                    troops, and to the exclusively Virginia brigade assigned Colonel Jackson as its
                    commander. The latter was almost immediately commissioned brigadier-general, and
                    when early in June Johnston withdrew from Harper's Ferry to Winchester, he kept
                    Jackson at the front along the Baltimore and Ohio road to observe General
                    Patterson's preparations. Nothing of much importance occurred for several weeks,
                    beyond a little affair near Martinsburg in which Jackson captured about forty
                    men of a reconnoitering party sent out by Patterson. His vigilance was
                    ceaseless, and General Johnston felt sure, at Winchester, of ample warning of
                    any aggressive movement of the enemy. The first great distinction won by Jackson
                    was at Bull Run on the 21st of July. Soon after, he was promoted to
                    major-general, and the Confederate Government having on the 21st of October,
                    1861, organized the Department of Northern Virginia, under command of General
                    Joseph E. Johnston, it was divided into the Valley District, the Potomac
                    District, and Acquia District, to be commanded respectively by Major-Generals
                    Jackson, Beauregard, and Holmes. On October 28 General Johnston ordered Jackson
                    to Winchester to assume command of his district, and on the 6th of November the
                    War Department ordered his old "Stonewall" brigade, and six thousand troops
                    under command of Brigadier-General W. W. Loring, to report to him. These,
                    together with Ashby's cavalry, gave him a force of about ten thousand men all
                    told.</p>
<p>His only movement of note in the winter of 1861-2 was an expedition at the end of
                    December to Bath and Romney, to destroy the Baltimore and Ohio railroad and a
                    dam or two near Hancock on the Chesapeake and Ohio canal. The weather set in to
                    be very inclement about New Year's, with snow, rain, sleet, high winds, and
                    intense cold. Many in Jackson's command were opposed to the expedition, and as
                    it resulted in nothing of much military importance, but was attended with great
                    suffering on the part of his troops, nothing but the confidence he had won by
                    his previous services saved him from personal ruin. He and his second in
                    command, General Loring, had a serious disagreement. He ordered Loring to take
                    up his quarters, in January, in the exposed and cheerless village of Romney on
                    he south branch of the upper Potomac. Loring objected to this. Jackson was
                    inexorable. Loring and his principal officers united in a petition to Mr.
                    Benjamin, Secretary of War, to order them to Winchester, or at least away from
                    Romney. This document was sent direct to the War office, and the Secretary, in
                    utter disregard of "good order and discipline," granted the request, without
                    consulting Jackson. As soon as information reached Jackson of what had been
                    done, he indignantly resigned his commission. Governor Letcher was astounded,
                    and at once wrote Jackson a sympathetic letter, and then expostulated with Mr.
                    Davis and his Secretary with such vigor that an apology was sent to Jackson for
                    their obnoxious course. The orders were revoked and modified, and Jackson was
                    induced to retain his command. This little episode gave the Confederate civil
                    authorities in inkling of "what manner of man" "Stonewall" Jackson was. Devoted
                    as he was to the South, he had a due appreciation of his own character, and was
                    justly tenacious of all his personal rights, especially when their infraction
                    involved what he considered a fatal blow at the proper discipline of the army.</p>
<p>In that terrible winter's march and exposure, he endured all that any private was
                    exposed to. One morning, near Bath, some of his men, having crawled out from
                    under their snow-laden blankets, half-frozen, were cursing him as the cause of
                    their sufferings. He lay close by under a tree, also snowed under, and heard all
                    this; but without noticing it, presently crawled out too, and shaking the snow
                    off, made some jocular remark to the nearest men, who had no idea he had ridden
                    up in the night and lain down amongst them. The incident ran through the little
                    army in a few hours, and reconciled his followers to all the hardships of the
                    expedition, and fully reestablished his popularity.</p>
<p>As the winter wore on and spring was opening, a tremendous host of enemies was
                    assembling to crush out all resistance to the Federal Government in Virginia. In
                    March General McClellan withdrew from Johnston's front at Manassas, and
                    collected his army of more than one hundred thousand men on the Peninsula.
                    Johnston moved south to confront him. Jackson, whose entire army in the
                    Shenandoah Valley did not exceed thirteen thousand effective men of all arms,
                    retired up the Valley. McClellan had planned and organized a masterly movement
                    to capture, hold, and occupy the Valley and the Piedmont region; and if  his subordinates had been equal to the task, and there had been no
                    interference from Washington, it is probable the Confederate army would have
                    been driven out of Virginia and Richmond captured by midsummer, 1862.</p>
<p>Milroy, with near twelve thousand men, was on the Staunton and Parkersburg road
                    at McDowell, less than forty miles from Staunton, about the 1st of May. Fremont,
                    with a force reputed then at thirty thousand men, was at Franklin, only fifty
                    miles north-west of Staunton, and in close supporting distance from Milroy.
                    Banks, with over ten thousand men, was fortified at Strasburg, seventy miles
                    north-east of Staunton, by the great Valley turnpike. And Shields was on the
                    east side of the Blue Ridge, so as to be able to move either to Fredericksburg
                    or to the Luray Valley, and thence to Staunton. This force, aggregating about
                    sixty-four thousand men, was confronted by Jackson with barely thirteen
                    thousand. General McDowell, at the same time, was at or near Fredericksburg,
                    with a reputed force of forty thousand more Federals.</p>
<p>General Johnston could spare no assistance to Jackson, for McClellan was right in
                    his front with superior numbers, and menacing the capital of the Confederacy
                    with almost immediate and certain capture. Its only salvation depended upon
                    Jackson's ability to hold back Milroy, Fremont, Banks, Shields, and McDowell
                    long enough to let Johnston try doubtful conclusions with McClellan. If he
                    failed in this, these five commanders of an aggregate force then reputed to be,
                    and I believe in fact, over one hundred thousand, would converge and move down
                    upon Richmond from the west as McClellan advanced from the east, and the city
                    and its defenders would fall an easy prey to nearly, if not quite, a quarter of
                    a million of the best armed and equipped men ever put into the field by any
                    government.</p>
<p>"Stonewall" Jackson - silent as a sphinx, brave as a lion, and sustained by a
                    religious fervor as ardent as that of Cromwell's army, which believed in the
                    efficacy of prayer for success, but prudentially kept their powder dry-was near
                    Port Republic early in May, contemplating his surroundings and maturing his
                    plans. What these latter were no moral man but himself knew.</p>
<p>Suddenly the appalling news spread through the Valley that Jackson had fled from
                    his district to the east side of the Blue Ridge through Brown's and Swift Run
                    gaps. Only Ashby remained behind with about one thousand cavalry, scattered and
                    moving day and night in the vicinity of McDowell, Franklin, Strasburg, Front
                    Royal, and Luray, and reporting to Jackson every movement of his Briarean enemy.
                    Despair was fast settling upon the minds of the people with the Valley. Jackson
                    made no concealment of his flight. He indeed had gone, and the fact soon reached
                    his enemies. Milroy advanced two regiments to the top of the Shenandoah
                    Mountain, only twenty-two miles from Staunton, and was preparing to move his
                    entire force to Staunton, to be followed by Fremont.</p>
<p>Jackson had gone to Charlottesville and other stations on the Virginia Central
                    Railroad, and had collected enough railway trains to transport all of his little
                    army. That it was to be taken to Richmond when the troops were all embarked no
                    one doubted. It was Sunday, and many of his sturdy soldiers were Valley men.
                    With sad and gloomy hearts they boarded the trains. When all were on, lo! they
                    took a westward course, and a little after noon the first train rolled into
                    Staunton, the men got off, and as quickly as possible a cordon of sentinels was
                    thrown around the town, and no human being was permitted to pass out. The people
                    were at the churches. Those from the neighborhood could not return to their
                    homes because of the cordon of sentinels. News of Jackson's arrival spread like
                    wild-fire, and crowds flocked to the station to see the soldiers, and learn what
                    it all meant. No one knew, and no one could tell. The most prominent citizen of
                    the place was the venerable Judge Lucas P. Thompson, whose rank in the State
                    judiciary was inferior to none. He was a personal friend of General Jackson, and
                    the people urged him to see the General, and find out and tell them what Jackson
                    meant to do.</p>
<p>Jackson was found in a little room quietly writing some orders. He received his
                    old friend the Judge very cordially, who remarked: "General, your appearance
                    here is a complete surprise. We thought you had gone to Richmond." "Ah! indeed?"
                    said Jackson. "Yes; and we can't understand it. Where are you going? or do you
                    expect to meet the enemy here?" Jackson's eye twinkled with amusement, as he
                    leaned over and spoke to the Judge in a low, confidential tone: "Judge, can you
                    keep a secret-a secret that must not be told to any one?" "Oh, yes!" "So can I,
                    Judge, and you must excuse me for not telling it to you." His Honor's face
                    turned scarlet, and he soon left, answering his eager questioners with judicial
                    gravity, "Jackson's movement is a secret."</p>
<p>As soon as the troops could be put in motion they took the road leading towards
                    McDowell, the General having sent forward cavalry to Buffalo Gap and beyond to
                    arrest all persons going that way. The next morning by a circuitous
                    mountain-path he tried to send  a brigade of infantry to the rear
                    of Milroy's two regiments on Shenandoah Mountain, but they were improperly
                    guided and failed to reach their proposed position in time, and both regiments
                    escaped when attacked in front. Jackson followed as rapidly as possible, and the
                    following day, May 8, encountered Milroy's army on top of the mountain three
                    miles east of McDowell. The conflict lasted many hours, and was severe and
                    bloody. It was fought mainly with small arms, the ground forbidding much use of
                    artillery. Milroy was routed, and fled precipitately towards Franklin, to unite
                    with Fremont. The route lay along a narrow valley hedged by high mountains,
                    perfectly protecting the flanks of the retreating army from Ashby's pursuing
                    cavalry. Jackson ordered Ashby to pursue as vigorously as possible, and to guard
                    completely all avenues of approach from the direction of McDowell or Staunton
                    till relieved of this duty. Jackson buried the dead and rested his army one day,
                    and then fell back to the Valley on the Warm Springs and Harrisonburg road. (See
                    map, page 293.)</p>
<p>It was sometimes questioned whether Jackson was entitled to all the credit for
                    the strategy that enabled him in thirty-three days, with thirteen thousand men,
                    to defeat successively Milroy, Banks, Fremont, and Shields, with an aggregate
                    force of sixty-four thousand men, and to clear the Valley of all hostile troops.
                    I happen to know one fact that sheds a flood of light on this question, and have
                    repeated it hundreds of times, though I do not know that it has ever been in
                    print. It is this:</p>
<p>The morning after the battle of McDowell I called very early on Jackson at the
                    residence of Colonel George W. Hull of that village, where he had his
                    headquarters, to ask if I could be of any service to him, as I had to go to
                    Staunton, forty miles distant, to look after some companies that were to join my
                    command. He asked me to wait a few moments, as he wished to prepare a telegram
                    to be sent to President Davis from Staunton, the nearest office to McDowell. He
                    took a seat at a table and wrote nearly half a page of foolscap; he rose and
                    stood before the fire-place pondering it some minutes; then he tore it into
                    pieces and wrote again, but much less, and again destroyed what he had written,
                    and paced the room several times. He suddenly stopped, seated himself, and
                    dashed off two or three lines, folded the paper, and said, "Send that off as
                    soon as you reach Staunton." As I bade him "good-bye," he remarked: "I may have
                    other telegrams to-day or to-morrow, and will send them to you for transmission.
                    I wish you to have two or three well-mounted couriers ready to bring me the
                    replies promptly." I promised to do so and departed.</p>
<p>I read the message he had given me. It was dated "McDowell," and read about thus:
                    "Providence blessed our arms with victory over Milroy's forces yesterday." That
                    was all. The second day thereafter a courier arrived with a message to be
                    telegraphed to the Secretary of War. I read it, sent it off, and ordered a
                    courier to be ready with his horse, while I waited at the telegraph office for
                    the reply. The message was to this effect: "I think I ought to attack Banks, but
                    under my orders I do not feel at liberty to do so." In less than an hour a reply
                    came, but not from the Secretary of War. It was from General Joseph E. Johnston,
                    to whom I supposed the Secretary had referred General Jackson's message. I have
                    a distinct recollection of its substance, as follows: "If you think you can beat
                    Banks, attack him. I only intended by my orders to caution you against attacking
                    fortifications." Banks was understood to have strongly fortified himself at
                    Strasburg and Cedar Creek. I started the courier with this reply, as I supposed
                    to McDowell, but, lo! it met Jackson only twelve miles from Staunton, to which
                    point on the Harrisonburg and Warm Springs turnpike he had marched the whole of
                    his little army except Ashby's cavalry, about one thousand men. These latter,
                    under that intrepid leader, Ashby, who was to fall within a month, he had sent
                    from McDowell to menace Fremont, who was at Franklin in Pendleton County, where
                    he remained in blissful ignorance that Jackson had left McDowell, till
                    telegraphed some days later by Banks that Jackson had fallen upon him at Front
                    Royal and driven him through Winchester and across the Potomac.</p>
<p>Two hours after receiving this telegram from General Johnston, Jackson was <u>en route</u> for Harrisonburg, where he came upon the
                    great Valley turnpike. By forced marches he reached New Market in two days.
                    Detachments of cavalry guarded every road beyond him, so that Banks remained in
                    total ignorance of his approach. This Federal commander had the larger part of
                    his force well fortified at and near Strasburg, but he kept a large detachment
                    at Front Royal, about eight miles distant and facing the Luray or Page Valley.</p>
<p>From New Market Jackson disappeared so suddenly that the people of the Valley
                    were again mystified. He crossed the Massanutten Mountain, and passing Luray,
                    hurried towards Front Royal. He sometimes made thirty miles in twenty-four hours
                    with his entire army, gaining for his infantry the sobriquet of "Jackson's foot
                    cavalry." He struck Front Royal very early in the morning of May 23. The
                    surprise was complete, and disastrous to the enemy under Colonel John R. Kenly.
                    After a short and fruit-  less resistance they fled towards
                    Winchester, twenty miles distant, with Jackson at their heels.</p>
<p>News of this disaster reached Banks at Strasburg, by which he learned that
                    Jackson was rapidly gaining his rear toward Newtown. The works Banks had
                    constructed had not been made for defense in that direction. He abandoned them
                    and set out with all haste for Winchester; but <u>en
                    route</u>, near Newtown (May 24), Jackson struck his flank, inflicting heavy
                    loss, and making enormous captures of property, consisting of wagons, teams,
                    camp equipage, provisions, ammunition, and over seven thousand stand of arms,
                    all new, and in perfect order; also, a large number of prisoners.</p>
<p>Jackson chased Banks's fleeing army beyond Winchester (May 25), and held his
                    ground till he was satisfied they had crossed the Potomac. His problem now was
                    to escape Fremont's clutches, knowing that that officer would be promptly
                    advised by wire of what had befallen Banks. He could go back the way he came, by
                    the Luray valley, but that would expose Staunton (the most important depot in
                    the valley) to capture by Fremont, and he had made his plans to save it.</p>
<p>I had been left at Staunton organizing my recruits. From New Market on his way to
                    attack Banks, Jackson sent me an order to throw as many men as I could arm, and
                    as quickly as possible, into Brock's Gap, went of Harrisonburg, and any other
                    mountain-pass through which Fremont could reach the Valley at or south of
                    Harrisonburg. I knew that within four miles of Franklin, on the main road
                    leading to Harrisonburg, there was an narrow defile hemmed in on both sides by
                    nearly perpendicular cliffs, over five hundred feet high. I sent about fifty
                    men, well armed with long-range guns to occupy these cliffs, and defend the
                    passage to the last extremity. They got there in time.</p>
<p>As soon as Fremont learned of Banks's defeat, he put his array in motion to cut
                    off Jackson's retreat up the Valley. Ashby was still in his front towards
                    McDowell, with an unknown force; so Fremont did not attempt that route, but sent
                    his cavalry to feel the way towards Brock's Gap, on the direct road to
                    Harrisonburg. The men I had sent to the cliffs let the head of the column get
                    well into the defile or gorge, when, from a position of perfect safety to
                    themselves, they poured a deadly volley into the close column. Being so
                    unexpected, and coming from a foe of unknown strength, the Federal column halted
                    and hesitated to advance. Another volley and the "rebel yell" from the cliffs
                    turned them back, never to appear again. Fremont took the road to Moorefield,
                    and thence to Strasburg. It shows how close had been Jackson's calculation of
                    chances, to state that as his rear-guard marched up Fisher's Hill, two miles
                    from Strasburg, Fremont's advance came in sight on the mountain-side on the road
                    from Moorefield. Jackson continued his march up the Valley to Harrisonburg,
                    hotly pursued by Fremont, but avoiding a conflict.</p>
<p>The news of Banks's defeat created consternation at Washington, and Shields was
                    ordered to the Luray valley in all haste to cooperate with Fremont. Jackson was
                    advised of Shields's approach, and his aim was to prevent a junction of their
                    forces till he reached a point where he could strike them in quick succession.
                    He therefore sent cavalry detachments along the Shenandoah to burn the bridges
                    as far as Port Republic, the river being at that time too full for fording. At
                    Harrisonburg he took the road leading to Port Republic, and ordered me from
                    Staunton, with a mixed battery and battalion of cavalry, to the bridge over
                    North River near Mount Crawford, to prevent a cavalry force passing to his rear.</p>
<p>At Cross Keys, about four miles from Harrinsonburg, he delivered battle to
                    Fremont, on June 8, and after a long and bloody conflict, as night closed in he
                    was master of the field. Leaving one brigade - Ewell's - on the ground, to
                    resist Fremont if he should return next day, he that night marched the rest of
                    his army to Port Republic, which lies in the forks of the river, and made his
                    arrangements to attack Shields next morning on the Lewis farm, just below Port
                    Republic.</p>
<p>On the day of the conflict at Cross Keys I held the bridge across North River at
                    Mount Crawford with a battalion of cavalry, four howitzers, and a Parrott gun,
                    to prevent a cavalry flank movement on Jackson's trains at Port Republic. About
                    ten o'clock at night I received a note from Jackson, written in pencil on the
                    blank margin of a newspaper, directing me to report with my command at Port
                    Republic before daybreak. On the same slip, and as a postscript, he wrote, "Poor
                    Ashby is dead. He fell gloriously . . [June 6] I know you will join with me in
                    mourning the loss of our friend, one of the noblest men and soldiers in the
                    Confederate army." I carried that slip of paper till it was literally worn to
                    tatters.</p>
<p>It was nearly dark when Jackson and his staff reached the bridge at Port Republic
                    from Cross Keys. Shields had sent two guns and a few men under a green
                    lieutenant to the bridge. They arrived about the same time as Jackson, and his
                    troops soon coming up, the Federal lieutenant and his supports made great haste
                    in the dark back to the Lewis farm.</p>
<p>I reached Port Republic an hour before day-  break of June 9, and
                    sought the house occupied by Jackson; but not wishing to disturb him so early, I
                    asked the sentinel what room was occupied by "Sandy" Pendleton, Jackson's
                    adjutant-general.</p>
<p>"Upstairs, first room on the right," he replied.</p>
<p>Supposing he meant our right as we faced the house, up I went, softly opened the
                    door, and discovered General Jackson lying on his face across the bed, fully
                    dressed, with sword, sash, and boots all on. The low-burnt tallow candle on the
                    table shed but a dim light, yet enough by which to see and recognize this
                    person. I had entered the wrong room, and I endeavored to withdraw without
                    waking him, but it was too late.</p>
<p>He turned over, sat up on the bed, and called out, "Who is that?"</p>
<p>I immediately stepped again inside the room and apologized for the intrusion. He
                    checked me with "That is all right. It's time to be up. I am glad to see you.
                    Were the men all up as you came through camp?"</p>
<p>"Yes, General, and cooking."</p>
<p>"That's right. We move at daybreak. Sit down while I wash. I want to talk to
                    you."</p>
<p>I had long ago learned never to ask him questions about his plans, for he would
                    never answer such to any one. I therefore waited for him to speak first. He
                    referred very feelingly to Ashby's death, and spoke of it as an irreparable loss
                    to him or any future commander in the Valley. When he paused I said, "General,
                    you made a glorious winding-up of your four weeks' work yesterday."</p>
<p>He replied, "Yes, God blessed our army again yesterday, and I hope with his
                    protection and blessing we shall do still better to-day."</p>
<p>Then seating himself, for the first time in all my intercourse with him, he
                    outlined the day's proposed operations. I remember perfectly his conversation;
                    we had then learned to look upon him as invincible, if not inspired.</p>
<p>He said: "Charley Winder [Brigadier-General commanding his old 'Stonewall'
                    brigade] will cross the river at daybreak and attack Shields on the Lewis farm
                    [two miles below]. I shall support him with all the other troops as fast as they
                    can be put in line. General 'Dick' Taylor will move through the woods on the
                    side of the mountain with his Louisiana brigade, and rush upon their left flank
                    by the time the action becomes general. By ten o'clock we shall get them on the
                    run, and I'll now tell you what I want with you. Send the big new rifle-gun you
                    have [a twelve-pounder Parrott] to Poague [commander of the Rockbridge
                    Artillery], and let your mounted men report to the cavalry. I want you in person
                    to take your mountain howitzers to the field, in some safe position in rear of
                    the line, keeping everything packed on the mules, ready at any moment to take to
                    the mountain-side. Three miles below Lewis's there is a defile on the Luray
                    road. Shields may rally and make a stand there. If he does, I can't reach him
                    with the field batteries on account of the woods. You can carry your
                    twelve-pounder howitzers on the mules up the mountain-side, and, at some good
                    place, unpack and shell the enemy out of the defile, and the cavalry will do the
                    rest."</p>
<p>The plan of battle was carried out to the letter. I took position in a ravine
                    about two hundred yards in rear of Poague's battery in the center of the line.
                    General Shields made a very stubborn flight, and by nine o'clock began to look
                    very serious for us. Dick Taylor had not yet come down out of the woods on
                    Shields's left flank.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I was having a remarkable time with our mules in the ravine. Some of
                    the shot aimed at Poague came bounding over our heads, and occasionally a shell
                    would burst there. The mules became frantic. They kicked, plunged, and squealed.
                    It was impossible to quiet them, and it took three or four men to hold one mule
                    from breaking away. Each mule had about three hundred pounds' weight on him, so
                    securely fastened that the load could not be dislodged by any of his capers.
                    Several of them lay down and tried to wallow their loads off. The men held these
                    down, and that suggested the idea of throwing them all on the ground and holding
                    them there. The ravine sheltered us so that we were in no danger from the shot
                    or shell which passed over us.</p>
<p>Just about the time our mule "circus" was at its height, news came up the line
                    from the left that Winder's brigade near the river was giving way. Jackson rode
                    down in that direction to see what it meant. As he passed on the brink of our
                    ravine, his eye caught the scene, and, reining up a moment, he accosted me with
                    "Colonel, you seem to have trouble down there." I made some reply which drew
                    forth a hearty laugh, and he said, "Get your mules to the mountain as soon as
                    you can, and be ready to move."</p>
<p>Then he dashed on. He found his old brigade had yielded slightly to overwhelming
                    pressure. Galloping up, he was received with a cheer; and, calling out at the
                    top of his voice, "The 'Stonewall' brigade never retreats; follow me!" led them
                    back to their original line.  Taylor soon made his appearance, and
                    the flank attack settled the work of the day. A wild retreat began. The pursuit
                    was vigorous. No stand was made in the defile. We pursued them eight miles. I
                    rode back with Jackson, and at sunset we were on the battlefield at Lewis
                    mansion.</p>
<p>Jackson accosted a medical officer, and said, "Have you brought off all the
                    wounded?"</p>
<p>"Yes, all of ours, but not all of the enemy's."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"Because we were shelled from across the river."</p>
<p>"Had you your hospital flag on the field?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"And they shelled that?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Well, take your men to their quarters; I would rather let them all die than have
                    one of my men shot intentionally under the yellow flag when trying to save their
                    wounded. They are barbarians."</p>
<p>Fremont, hearing the noise of the battle, had hurried out from Harrisonburg to
                    help Shields; but Jackson had burnt the bridge at Port Republic, after Ewell had
                    held Fremont in check some time on the west side of the river and escaped, so
                    that when Fremont came in sight of Shields's battle-field the latter had been
                    whipped and the river could not be crossed. And, as this medical officer
                    reported, Fremont then shelled the relief parties, thus compelling many of
                    Shields's wounded to pass a dreadful night where they lay. No doubt many died
                    who might have been saved.</p>
<p>The next day I returned to Staunton, and found General W. H. C. Whiting, my old
                    commander after the fall of General Bee at Bull Run, arriving with a division of
                    troops to reenforce Jackson. Taking him and his
                    staff to my house as guests, General Whiting left soon after breakfast with a
                    guide to call on Jackson at Swift Run Gap, near Port Republic, where he was
                    resting his troops. The distance from Staunton was about twenty miles, but
                    Whiting returned after midnight. He was in a towering passion, and declared that
                    Jackson had treated him outrageously. I asked, "How is that possible, General,
                    for he is very polite to every one?"</p>
<p>"Oh! hang him, he was polite enough. But he didn't say one word about his plans,
                    though he knows I am next in rank to him, and second in command. I finally asked
                    him for orders, telling him what troops I had. He simply told me to go to
                    Staunton, and he would send me orders to-morrow. I haven't the slightest idea
                    what they will be. I believe he hasn't any more sense than my horse."</p>
<p>Seeing his frame of mind, and he being a guest in my house, I said little. Just
                    after breakfast next morning, a courier arrived with a terse order to embark his
                    troops on the railroad trains and move to Gordonsville at once, where he would
                    receive further orders. This brought on a new explosion of wrath. "Didn't I tell
                    you he was a fool, and don't this prove it? Why, I just came through
                    Gordonsville day before yesterday."</p>
<p>However, he obeyed the order; and when he reached Gordonsville he found Jackson
                    there, and his little Valley army coming after him; a few days later McClellan
                    was astounded when Jackson struck his right flank on the Chickahominy. Shortly
                    after the seven days' battles around Richmond, I met Whiting again, and he then
                    said: "I didn't know Jackson when I was at your house. I have found out now what
                    his plans were, and they were worthy of a Napoleon. But I still think he ought
                    to have told me his plans; for if he had died McClellan would have captured
                    Richmond. I wouldn't have known what he was driving at, and might have made a
                    mess of it. But I take back all I said about his being a fool."</p>
<p>From the date of Jackson's arrival at Staunton till the battle of Port Republic
                    was 35 days. He marched from Staunton to McDowell, 40 miles, from McDowell to
                    Front Royal, about 110, from Front Royal to Winchester, 20 miles, Winchester to
                    Port Republic, 75 miles, a total of 245 miles, fighting in the meantime four
                    desperate battles, and winning them all.</p>
<p>On the 17th of June, leaving only his cavalry, under Brigadier-General B. H.
                    Robertson, and Chew's battery, and the little force I was enlisting in the
                    Valley, now no longer threatened by the enemy, Jackson moved all his troops
                    south-east, and on the 25th he was at Ashland, seventeen miles from Richmond.
                    This withdrawal from the Valley was so skillfully managed that his absence from
                    the scene of his late triumphs was unsuspected at Washington. on the contrary,
                    something like a panic prevailed there, and the Government was afraid to permit
                    McDowell to unite his forces with McClellan's lest it should uncover and expose
                    the capital to Jackson's supposed movement on it.</p>
<p>Jackson's military operations were always unexpected and mysterious. In my
                    personal intercourse with him in the early part of the war, before he had become
                    famous, he often said there were two things never to be lost sight of by a
                    military commander: "Always mystify, mislead and surprise the enemy, if
                    possible; and when you strike and overcome him, never let up in the pursuit so
                    long as your men have strength to follow; for an army routed, if hotly pursued,
                         becomes panic-stricken, and can then be destroyed by half
                    their number. The other rule is, Never fight against heavy odds, if by any
                    possible maneuvering you can hurl your own force on only a part, and that the
                    weakest part, of your enemy and crush it. Such tactics will win every time, and
                    a small army may thus destroy a large one in detail, and repeated victory will
                    make it invincible."</p>
<p>His wonderful celerity of movement was a simple matter. He never broke down his
                    men by too-long-continued marching. He rested the whole column very often, but
                    only for a few minutes at a time, and he liked to see the men lie down flat on
                    the ground to rest, saying, "A man rests all over when he lies down."</p>
