<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> Brief description of a battle at New Market.</p>
<p>In Rev. Giles Cook's sketch of the fight at New
                    Market he recalls some facts that I send you. Sigel came up to New Market on the
                    14th of May, 1864, and was met by Imboden's Brigade and held there until after
                    night. It was very dark. I took twenty men and crawled up close to their line
                    and fired into their faces. They moved back about a mile below the town. Then we
                    moved about five miles and met General Breckinridge, when we all came back
                    together to the same position that we had on the 14th. On the 15th, soon after
                    daylight, we commenced shelling them, and they returned the artillery fire,
                    keeping it up until about nine o'clock. Our regiment, the 62d Virginia, was
                    attached to General Wharton's  Brigade, and we were formed in line.
                    The 51st Virginia was on the left of the 62d and the 62d on the left of the
                        M. I. Cadets, extending to the
                    right of the Staunton Pike. Our regiment was on the left of the pike. We marched
                    to the lower side of New Market, then we were ordered to charge.</p>
