                <p>Expedition Into Maryland and Pennsylvania - Burning of Chambersburg</p>
                <p>On the 26th we moved to Martinsburg, the cavalry going to the Potomac. The 27th
                    and 28th were employed in destroying the railroad, it having been repaired since
                    we passed over it at the beginning of the month. While at Martinsburg, it was
                    ascertained, beyond all doubt, that Hunter had been again indulging in his <orig
                        reg="favorite">favourite</orig> mode of warfare, and that, after his <pb
                        n="67"/> return to the Valley, while we were near Washington, among other
                    outrages, the private residences of Mr. Andrew Hunter, a member of the Virginia
                    Senate, Mr. Alexander R. Boteler, an ex-member of the Confederate Congress, as
                    well as of the United States Congress, and Edmund I. Lee, a distant relative of
                    General Lee, all in Jefferson County, with their contents, had been burned by
                    his orders, only time enough being given for the ladies to get out of the
                    houses. A number of towns in the South, as well as private country houses, had
                    been burned by the Federal troops, and the accounts had been heralded forth in
                    some of the Northern papers in terms of exultation, and gloated over by their
                    readers, while they were received with apathy by others. I now came to the
                    conclusion that we had stood this mode of warfare long enough, and that it was
                    time to open the eyes of the people of the North to its enormity, by an example
                    in the way of retaliation. I did not select the cases mentioned, as having more
                    merit or greater claims for retaliation than others, but because they had
                    occurred within the limits of the country covered by my command, and were
                    brought more immediately to my attention.</p>
                <p>The town of Chambersburg in Pennsylvania was selected as the one on which
                    retaliation should be made, and McCausland was ordered to proceed with his
                    brigade and that of Johnson and a battery of artillery to that place, and demand
                    of the municipal authorities the sum of $100,000 in gold, or $500,000 in United
                    States currency, as a compensation for the destruction of the houses named and
                    their contents; and, in default of payment, to lay the town in ashes, in
                    retaliation for the <pb n="68"/> burning of those houses and others in Virginia,
                    as well as for the towns which had been burned in other Southern States. A
                    written demand to that effect was sent to the municipal authorities, and they
                    were informed what would be the result of a failure or refusal to comply with
                    it. I desired to give the people of Chambersburg an opportunity of saving their
                    town, by making compensation for part of the injury done, and hoped that the
                    payment of such a sum would have the desired effect, and open the eyes of the
                    people of other towns at the North, to the necessity of urging upon their
                    government the adoption of a different policy. McCausland was also directed to
                    proceed from Chambersburg towards Cumberland in Maryland, and levy contributions
                    in money upon that and other towns able to bear them, and if possible destroy
                    the machinery at the coal pits near Cumberland, and the machine shops, depots,
                    and bridges on the Baltimore and Ohio railroad as far as practicable.</p>
                <p>On the 29th, McCausland crossed the Potomac near Clear Spring, above
                    Williamsport, and I moved with <orig reg="Rhodes'">Rodes'</orig> and' Ramseur's
                    divisions and Vaughan's cavalry to the latter place, while Imboden demonstrated
                    with his and Jackson's cavalry towards Harper's Ferry, in order to withdraw
                    attention from McCausland. Breckenridge remained at Martinsburg and continued
                    the destruction of the railroad. Vaughan drove a force of cavalry from
                    Williamsport, and went into Hagerstown, where he captured and destroyed a train
                    of cars loaded with supplies. One of <orig reg="Rhodes'">Rodes'</orig> brigades
                    was crossed over at Wi1liamsport and subsequently withdrawn. On the 30th,
                    McCausland being well under way, I moved back to Martinsburg, and on the 31st
                    the whole infantry force was moved to Bunker Hill, where we remained on the 1st,
                    2nd, and 3rd of August.</p>
                <p>On the 4th, in order to enable McCausland to retire from Pennsylvania and
                    Maryland, and to keep Hunter, who had been reinforced by the 6th and 19th Corps,
                    and had been oscillating between Harper's Ferry and Monocacy Junction, in a
                    state of uncertainty, I again moved to the Potomac with the infantry and
                    Vaughan's and Jackson's cavalry, while Imboden demonstrated towards Harper's
                    Ferry. On the 5th <orig reg="Rhodes'">Rodes'</orig> and <pb n="69"/> Ramseur's
                    divisions crossed at Williamsport and took position near St. James' College, and
                    Vaughan's cavalry went into Hagerstown. Breckenridge, with his command, and
                    Jackson's cavalry, crossed at Shepherdstown, and took position at Sharpsburg.
                    This position is in full view from Maryland Heights, and a cavalry force was
                    sent out by the enemy to <orig reg="reconnoiter">reconnoitre</orig>, which,
                    after skirmishing with Jackson's cavalry, was driven off by the sharpshooters of
                    Gordon's division. On the 6th, the whole force <orig reg="re-crossed"
                    >recrossed</orig> the Potomac at Williamsport, and moved towards Martinsburg;
                    and on the 7th we returned to Bunker Hill.</p>
                <pb n="70"/>
                <p>On the 30th of July McCausland reached Chambersburg, and made the demand as
                    directed, reading to such of the authorities as presented themselves the paper
                    sent by me. The demand was not complied with, the people stating that they were
                    not afraid of having their town burned, and that a Federal force was
                    approaching. The policy pursued by our army on former occasions had been so
                    lenient, that they did not suppose the threat was in earnest this time, and they
                    hoped for speedy relief. McCausland, however, proceeded to carry out his orders,
                    and the greater part of the town was laid in ashes. He then moved in the
                    direction of Cumberland, but, on approaching that town, he found it defended by
                    a force under Kelly too strong for him to attack, and he withdrew towards
                    Hampshire County in Virginia, and crossed the Potomac near the mouth of the
                    South Branch, capturing the garrison at that place and partially destroying the
                    railroad bridge. He then invested the post on the railroad at New Creek, but
                    finding it too strongly fortified to take by assault, he moved to Moorefield in
                    Hardy County, near which place he halted to rest and recruit his men and horses,
                    as the command was now considered safe from pursuit. Averill, however, had been
                    pursuing from Chambersburg with a body of cavalry, and Johnson's brigade was
                    surprised in camp, before day, on the morning of the 7th of August, and routed
                    by Averill's force. This resulted also in the rout of McCausland's brigade, and
                    the loss of the artillery (4 pieces) and about 300 prisoners from the whole
                    command. The balance of the command made its way to Mount Jackson in great
                    disorder, and much weakened. This affair had a very damaging effect upon my
                    cavalry for the rest of the campaign.</p>
