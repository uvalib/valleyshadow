<h3 class="section-head">Augusta: "About the Fifty-Second Virginia Regiment," by Marion
                            Koiner, 1913</h3>
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> Marion Koiner, a corporal in the Waynesboro Guards, recounts his experiences
                    during the war, including being wounded, meeting Stonewall Jackson, and serving
                    as a courier for General Lee.</p>
<p>The writer was in Company B, 52d Virginia Regiment. His company was made up of
                    young men from Augusta County and vicinity and was known as the Waynesboro
                    Guards. It was organized the latter part of July with William Long as captain
                    and A. J. Thompson, T. H. Antrim, and Clinton King lieutenants. The writer was a
                    corporal.</p>
<p>Soon after the organization the company was transported to Staunton and placed in
                    a camp of instruction of the grounds of the Deaf and Dumb Asylum. The regiment
                    having been completed with a quota of ten companies under the command of Col. J.
                    B. Baldwin, Lieut. Col. M. G. Harman, and Major Ross, we were marched to the
                    Fork of Waters, in Highland County, about September 10. Remaining there until
                    sometime in October, we were marched to the top of Alleghany Mountain, where we
                    were joined by the 10th Georgia and 31st Virginia Regiments, the 25th Virginia
                    Battalion, and the Rockbridge Artillery. About December 1 we went into winter
                    quarters, where we remained until the following April.</p>
<p>The brigade was commanded by Brig.Gen. Edward Johnson. On December 10 Major Ross called
                    for a hundred volunteers to go on a scout down the Greenbrier River. The writer
                    became one of the number. On the 11th the expedition left camp; and being guided
                    by a citizen familiar with the mountains, we went to the narrows on the
                    Greenbrier River, where we lay in ambush the remainder of the day. At nightfall
                    we were withdrawn into a recess in the mountains and encamped for the night. it
                    was a very frosty night; perfectly calm and clear. Early the next morning we
                    were marched back to the narrows and concealed again in a dense pine thicket.
                    The main road was just across the river. Here we remained until about 3 P.M.,
                    when the advance guards of the Federal army, which had been stationed on Cheat
                    Moutnain, approached. Just as the squad got directly opposite us we fired into
                    them, killing a number, and the rest scattered away. The main column of the
                    Federals was approaching and, having located us from our firing, poured a
                    fusillade of bullets into the pine thicket. Our commander, Major Ross, withdrew
                    our command, and we returned to our quarters about ten o'clock.</p>
<p>Next morning, the 13th, at about three o'clock the long roll was beat, and we
                    were hurried out to our breastworks, which had already been constructed. We
                    heard that the Yankees were coming to attack our position. About dawn the attack
                    was begun, the Yankee column having divided, a part passing to the right and the
                    other to the left of our position. The engagement lasted only an hour or two, as
                    the enemy was easily repulsed. Only one or two companies of my regiment had but
                    few casualties. My company was not engaged. George A. Coyner and his squad of
                    pickets were captured, being cut off from returning back to camp.</p>
<p>Nothing further occurred to disturb the monotony of camp life during the winter.
                    We had comfortable log cabins and good rations and fuel.</p>
<p>About April 1 following we left Alleghany. We marched back to Shenandoah Mountain
                    and camped there for a week or so; then still farther back to Valley Mills,
                    staying equally as long. During the first week in May we marched again toward
                    the mountains. Near McDowell, in Highland County, we came upon the Yankee army
                    which had been cautiously proceeding eastward, and it gave us battle. This was
                    on May 8, 1862. My regiment was posted on the crest of Settington's Hill, and my
                    company was in the hottest of the battle. After firing a short while, I was
                    struck in the right forearm by a musket ball which passed through the army below
                    the elbow. A Bible and diary which I carried in my right breast pocket were
                    penetrated. We were on our knees firing. I went to the rear, and Dr. C. C.
                    Henkel dressed my arm and sent me to the field hospital, a farmhouse. There I
                    first saw Gen. Stonewall Jackson. He had just arrived from the Valley with his
                    forced and rode up to our line of battle just before the firing began. Captain
                    Long, of my company, was killed and quite a number were wounded. The 10th
                    Georgia suffered severely in killed and wounded. The writer's brother, Dillard
                    M. Koiner, was also wounded in this engagement. The next day after the battle
                    the wounded were transferred to Staunton Hospital, and after several days I was
                    allowed to go home. My wound having healed, the latter part of July 1 returned
                    to my company, then in Orange County.</p>
<p>On August 9 the battle of Cedar Mountain was fought. My company and Company A of
                    my regiment were detached from the regiment in the morning to guard a point some
                    miles from the battle field. A few days after the battle the army returned to
                    the old camp in Orange County, where we remained for about two weeks. Our next
                    move culminated in the second battle of Manassas on August 28, 29, and 30. On</p>
<p>Then followed the capture at Harper's Ferry of 11,000 Federals in a railroad cut.
                    They were driven out, but we suffered severely in killed and wounded.</p>
<p>Then followed the capture at Harper's Ferry of 11,000 Federal prisoners and a
                    large amount of artillery and small arms. My brigade was with Jackson's
                    division.</p>
<p>The battle of Antietam, or Sharpsburg, was fought on the 17th of September. I was
                    broken down and unable to go into this battle, but rejoined my command the next
                    day.</p>
<p>Returning to Virginia, we were moved to different sections of the country
                    contiguous to the Potomac River until in November. Being worn out with continual
                    marching, my father procured a substitute and I was released and went home. I
                    remained upon the farm until February, 1864, when I rejoined the army, enlisting
                    in Company C, 39th Vattalion Virginia Cavalry, and was assigned to Gen. R. E.
                    Lee's headquarters as courier and guard. Each day a detail was made from this
                    battalion for guards and couriers for all the head departments of the Army of
                    Northern Virginia. It was my pleasure to see the great Lee almost every day.</p>
<p>At the time of my reenlistment the army was encamped near Orange Courthouse,
                    having gone into winter quarters late in 1863. During the winter I spent a good
                    part of the time as permanent courier for General Anderson, who had his
                    headquarters there.</p>
<p>About the 14th of March I was allowed a furlough of thirty days to go home for a
                    fresh horse. On the way home I met two of Sheridan's scouts on the lower edge of
                    Albemarle County; but being in company with somee four or five of my command,
                    who were on furlough at the same time, we were not molested. They represented
                    themselves as belonging to Roger's command of cavalry.</p>
<p>I arrived home on the 17th or 18th of March, and knew nothing of the evacuation
                    of Petersburg until the evening of the 9th of April, the day that General Lee
                    surrendered, and I was going to return to my company on the 10th. Thus ended my
                    career as a soldier in that terrible war.</p>
<p>It is but fitting that I acknowledge the protecting hand of a gracious God
                    through the whole bloody conflict.</p>
