                <p>LEXINGTON, <abbr expan="Virginia">VA.</abbr>, August 8, 1894.</p>
                <p>The first annual reunion of the Second Rockbridge Dragoons or Company H, of
                    Fourteenth Virginia Regiment, was held here yesterday. At an early hour the
                    gray-haired veterans began to pour into the town. The trains brought their
                    quota. Not only was the Fourteenth Regiment out in force, but other veterans
                    were present in large numbers from various commands. Some of the old "vets" had
                    not met since the surrender, and reminiscences and war anec-<pb n="74"/>dotes
                    were the order of the day. At noon the bugle was sounded for the formation, and
                    Company H, Company C, and Company I, mounted, formed in line facing the
                    courthouse, <orig reg="under">ander</orig> the command of Colonel John A.
                    Gibson. To the command "Right by twos," the "vets" wheeled into column, and
                    paraded the principal streets of the town.</p>
                <p>After the parade the roll was called and the command given: "Prepare for action;"
                    the enemy to be engaged was an elegant dinner prepared by Comrade C. W. Irvine
                    in his best style. After dinner speech-making was indulged in.</p>
                <p><abbr expan="The Honorable">Hon.</abbr> Wm. A. Anderson, Captain J. Pres. Moore,
                    and Colonel W. Bolivar F. Leech were the orators of the occasion. Their remarks
                    elicited the wildest enthusiasm, and the "rebel yell" made the dining-room ring.</p>
                <p>The next reunion will take place in Staunton on Court Monday, August 28, 1895,
                    when all the surviving members of the Fourteenth will be brought together again.</p>
                <p>The members of the companies represented were mostly from Rockbridge and Augusta
                    Counties.</p>
                <p>A noticeable incident of the day was that it was the thirtieth anniversary of the
                    day when Captain Wilson lost his arm.</p>
                <p>This command served all through the war, and was in the memorable raid through
                    Pennsylvania.</p>
