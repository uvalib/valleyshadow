                <p>This newspaper article complains about the lack of honor shown to General Robert
                    Anderson "of Fort Sumter fame" by refusing him a soldier's burial.</p>

                <p>The "powers that be" have disgraced the nation by the neglect to render proper
                    honors to the memory of General Robert Anderson of Fort <orig reg="Sumter"
                        >Sumpter</orig> fame. His remains were removed to West Point, and buried
                    there one day last week. The <hi rend="underline">Sun</hi> states that no
                    ceremonies were accorded to them; no troops drawn up, no music, no salute, and
                    not a man raised his hat. The caisson on which the coffin was placed was drawn
                    from the steamboat landing by four spavined horses, one of which nearly died
                    before reaching the academy grounds. General Roger stated to the <hi
                        rend="underline">Sun</hi> reporter that he had special orders from the war
                    department to pay no funeral honors to General Anderson at West Point.</p>
                <p>In reference to this affair the Philadelphia <hi rend="underline">Post</hi>
                    (Radical) has this to say: "Robert Anderson was a too much neglected man while
                    he lived. He was the modest, big-hearted Christian gentleman, and he was pushed
                    aside by military braggarts who were large in their own conceit. And now the
                    nation will be pained to know that the ceremonies, which are positively ordered
                    upon the burial of a soldier, were deliberately omitted, and that he was
                    consigned to his grave with a want of respect that was disgraceful. When alive,
                    he bravely faced the rattling of bullets and was undaunted by the shrieking of
                    shell and booming of cannon; when dead the tribute of respect that the musket
                    speaks should not have been <orig reg="withheld">witheld</orig>. Though his
                    companions and fellow officers seemed to forget the noble Anderson, in the
                    hearts of a grateful people he is enshrined, and they treasure his memory with
                    gratitude." </p>
