                            M. Tuttle, May 30, 1888</h3>
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> This is a laudatory poem about Robert E. Lee, indicative of the widespread
                    adulation for him that swept the nation, the former Confederacy, and Virginia in
                    the late ninettenth century.</p>
<p>As Pilot,<sup>*</sup> solitary, lone,<br> Sublimely rises
                        o'er the plain,<br> And from its pinnacle of
                    stone,<br> Like turret high of holy fane.<br> Looks down with condescending
                    gleam<br> On hamlet, village, field and stream;</p>
<p>So, too, above the common crowd,<br> In solemn grandeur singly rose,<br> With
                    many native gifts endowed,<br> The honored chieftain whom we chose<br> To lead
                    our armies-even he,<br> The world-renowned, great Robert Lee.</p>
<p>Thus from a more exalted plain,<br> Not haughtily as spirit mean,<br> But with
                    demeanor all urbane,<br> He looked down calmly on each scene,<br> And with a
                    wider range of view,<br> Man covered men as few could do.</p>
<p>Peace to his ashes! Gatherd all<br> In marble
                    mausoleum grand;<br> But in the Dixie capital,<br> As if still leading the
                    command.<br> High his equestrian statue raise,<br> That all may see who led
                    the Greys.</p>
<p>*Pilot mountain is a solitary cone of rock, which rises perpendicularly to a
                    great height above a comparatively level country, and is in Surry county, North
                    Carolina. The peake is quite a noted one.</p>
