<h3 class="section-head">Augusta County: "Monument to Gen. Jeb
                            Stuart.," by , November 28, 1887</h3>
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> This is a celebratory article about the J. E. B. Stuart statue that is to be
                    erected shortly. It is indicative of the adulation for former leaders of the
                    Confederacy that was so prominent in Virginia and Augusta County in the late
                    nineteenth century.</p>
<p>We learn from the Richmond <u>State</u> that, on Saturday
                    last, "the monument to mark the spot where the gallant "Jeb" Stuart fell was
                    taken out from Richmond to Yellow Tavern, in Henrico, six miles from Richmond,
                    to be placed in position, so that in coming years the exact spot where this
                    brave and chivalrous soldier received the wound which brought on death may be
                    forever established.</p>
<p>The monument is a beautiful granite shaft which towers fifteen and a half feet
                    above the ground. Two sabres crossed appear in bold relief on the monument, and
                    the die is beautifully polished. The main inscription upon the monument: "He
                    saved the State, but gave his life." No arrangements have yet been made for
                    dedicating the monument, but it is supposed that the Stuart Horse Guard and the
                    Hanover Troop will participate in the ceremonies."</p>
