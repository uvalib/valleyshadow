<h3 class="section-head">Franklin: "The Burning of Chambersburg," by General John M'Causland,
                            1879</h3>
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> M'Causland discusses his role as commander of the Confederate forces which burned
                    Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. He justifies his actions by describing Union raids
                    on the South, claiming that he was only following orders given by Jubal Early,
                    and pointing out that he gave fair warning to the people of Chambersburg before
                    ordering his men to burn the town.</p>
<p>The wanton destruction of the private property of citizens of Virginia, by the
                    orders of General Hunter, a Federal commander, may be considered as one of the
                    strongest reasons for the retaliation, by Early's order, upon the city of
                    Chambersburg. Andrew Hunter lived in the county of Jefferson, near Harper's
                    Ferry, and was a relative of General Hunter; A.R. Boteler and E.J. Lee also
                    lived in the same vicinity. No reasons that I have ever heard have been given
                    for the burning of their houses. Governor Letcher's property was in Lexington,
                    Virginia; the Military Institute was near Lexington, also. I do not think that
                    any better reasons can be given for the destruction of these properties than
                    could have been given if General Hunter had destroyed every house, barn, or
                    other building, that was standing and in good order, upon his line of march from
                    Staunton to Lynchburg. The property of J.T. Anderson was in the county of
                    Botetourt, and located near the banks of James river, at Buchanan. Mrs. Anderson
                    and a lady relative were the only occupants at the time. I destroyed the bridge
                    across James river to retard Hunter in his march upon Lynchburg, and it detained
                    him with his army for two days, during which time he occupied this house as his
                    headquarters. He promised the ladies protection, and after his departure, an
                    officer and some soldiers returned with a written order from him to destroy
                    everything about the premises. A few days afterward, as General Hunter was
                    passing another Virginia mansion, a lady asked him why he destroyed the
                    magnificent home of Colonel Anderson. He replied, "that Virginia women  were worse traitors than their husbands, and he would burn the
                    houses over their heads to make them personally and immediately experience some
                    punishment for their treason;" and on another occasion said to a lady, that he
                    would "humble the Virginia women before he left the State." I could enumerate
                    many other acts of actual destruction, and threats and acts of wanton violence
                    on the part of Hunter, all of which went to make up public sentiment that
                    prevailed at the time in Virginia, and which required the military authorities
                    to take some steps to prevent their recurrence in future, besides stopping the
                    useless destruction that was then going on. But what I have given is considered
                    sufficient to explain the reasons why the city of Chambersburg, in Pennsylvania,
                    was destroyed.</p>
<p>It may be considered as indispensable to give the location of the forces
                    composing the Union and Confederate armies during the latter part of the month
                    of July, 1864, in order to properly understand the raid that was made into the
                    State of Pennsylvania, and which resulted in the destruction of Chambersburg.
                    Hunter's army (Union) was scattered along the northern bank of the Potomac
                    river, in Maryland, from near Hancock to Harper's Ferry, the main body being
                    near the latter place. Early's army (Confederate) was located on the opposite
                    side of the same river with its main body near Martinsburg. Each army had its
                    cavalry on the flanks. My command was on the left of Early's army, and I think
                    that Averill's cavalry was located opposite to me - at least a portion of it was
                    there. When I speak of cavalry, in the course of this sketch, I am aware that
                    the term is not properly applied; and, as far as the Confederate troops which I
                    commanded were concerned, they were badly armed, badly mounted, and worse
                    equipped - in fact, they were mostly mounted militia. The men would have made
                    good soldiers if there had been time to discipline them, and arms and equipments
                    to have furnished them. The horses were nearly all worn out, and there was no
                    supply to draw others from. We attempted to get horses in Pennsylvania, but
                    found them removed from the line of march, and we had no time to look for them
                    elsewhere.</p>
<p>In July, 1864, the cavalry brigade which I commanded was encamped near the
                    Potomac river, in the county of Berkeley, West Virginia. It made the advance
                    post of the army under General Early, that was guarding the approaches into
                    Virginia through the Shenandoah Valley. On the 28th of July, I received an order
                    from General Early to cross the Potomac with my brigade and one under General
                    Bradley T. Johnson, and proceed to the city of Chambersburg, and after capturing
                    it to deliver, to the proper authorities, a  proclamation which he
                    had issued, calling upon them to furnish me with one hundred thousand dollars in
                    gold, or five hundred thousand dollars in greenbacks, and in case the money was
                    not furnished I was ordered to burn the city and return to Virginia. The
                    proclamation also stated that this course had been adopted in retaliation for
                    the destruction of property in Virginia, by the orders of General Hunter, and
                    specified that the houses of Andrew Hunter, A.R. Boteler, E.J. Lee, Governor
                    Letcher, J.T. Anderson, the Virginia Military Institute, and others in Virginia,
                    had been burned by the orders of General D. Hunter, a Federal commander, and
                    that the money demanded from Chambersburg was to be paid to these parties as a
                    compensation for their property. It appears that the policy of General Early had
                    been adopted upon proper reflection; that his orders were distinct and final,
                    and that what was done on this occasion by my command was not the result of
                    inconsiderate action or want of property authority, as was alleged by many
                    parties at the North, both at the time and since the close of the war.</p>
<p>On the 29th of July, the two cavalry brigades that were to make the dash into
                    Pennsylvania, by turning the right of Hunter's army, were assembled at or near
                    Hammond's mill, in Berkeley county, West Virginia. During the night the Federal
                    pickets on the northern side of the Potomac were captured, and the troops
                    crossed just at daylight on the morning of the 30th, and moved out and formed
                    the line of march on the National road. Major Gilmer drove the Federal cavalry
                    from the small village of Clear Spring, and pushed on toward Hagerstown to
                    create the impression that the rest of the troops were following. At Clear
                    Spring we left the National road and turned north on the Mercersburg road. We
                    reached Mercersburg about dark, and stopped to feed our horses, and to give time
                    for the stragglers to come up. After this stop the march was continued all
                    night, notwithstanding the opposition made at every available point by a
                    regiment of Federal cavalry. Major Sweeney, with his cavalry battalion, kept the
                    roads clear, and we reached Chambersburg at daylight on the 31st. The approach
                    to the town was defended only by one piece of artillery and some irregular
                    troops that were soon driven off, and the advances of our force took possession
                    of the town. The main part of the two brigades was formed in line on the high
                    ground overlooking the town. I at once went into the place with my staff, and
                    requested some of the citizens to inform the city authorities that I wanted to
                    see them. I also sent my staff through the town to find out where the proper
                    officials were, and inform them that I had a proclamation for their
                    consideration. Not one could be  found. I then directed the
                    proclamation to be read to many of the citizens that were near me, and requested
                    them to hunt up their officers, informing them I would wait until they could
                    either find them, or by consultation among themselves determine what they would
                    do. Finally, I informed them that I would wait six hours, and if they would
                    comply with the requisition their town would be safe; and in case they did not
                    it would be destroyed in accordance with my orders from General Early. After a
                    few hours of delay many citizens came to me - some were willing to pay the
                    money, others were not. I urged them to comply with such reasons as occurred to
                    me at the time, and told them plainly what they might expect. I showed to my own
                    officers the written instructions of General Early, and before a single house
                    was destroyed both the citizens and the Confederate officers that were present
                    fully understood why it was done, and by whose orders. After waiting until the
                    expiration of the six hours, and finding that the proclamation would not be
                    complied with, the destruction of the town was begun by firing the most central
                    blocks first, and after the inhabitants had been removed from them. Thus the
                    town was destroyed, and the inhabitants driven to the hills and fields adjacent
                    thereto. No lives were lost by the citizens, and only one soldier was killed,
                    and he was killed after the troops left the vicinity of the place. About noon
                    the troops were re-formed on the high ground overlooking the town, where the
                    most of them had been posted in the early morning, and the return to the Potomac
                    was begun shortly afterward. We encamped at McConnelsburg that night, and
                    reached the river the next day, at or near Hancock, Maryland.</p>
<p>In confirmation of what I have written Major Gilmer says in his book, "Four Years
                    in the Saddle," page 210: "He showed me General Early s [sic] order." General
                    Early, in his "Memoir," page 57, says: "A written demand was sent to the
                    municipal authorities, and they were informed what would be the result of a
                    failure or refusal to comply with it." On page 59 he says: "On the 30th of July,
                    McCausland reached Chambersburg, and made the demand as directed, reading to
                    such of the authorities as presented themselves the paper sent by me." Colonel
                    W.E. Peters, who commanded one of the regiments in Johnston's Brigade, when the
                    burning commenced came and asked me if the burning was being done by my orders.
                    I showed him the order of General Early, and he was satisfied, and proceeded to
                    carry out the order as was being done by other regiments of his brigade. In this
                    expedition the troops passed through more than one hundred miles of hostile
                    territory, executed  all orders that were issued with promptness
                    and regularity, and never have I heard of any complaints of acts unauthorized by
                    their superior officers. I think that these facts will show that this entire
                    expedition was planned and executed in accordance with the orders of superior
                    officers of competent authority to order it, and, moreover, that it was an act
                    of retaliation perfectly justified by the circumstances, and it was at all times
                    kept clearly within the rule governing civilized warfare.</p>
<p>Vattel in his "Law of Nations," lays down the following rule, and it may not be
                    inappropriate to quote it in order that many persons, who may read what is said
                    about the destruction of Chambersburg, may have the opinion of a standard
                    authority upon such proceedings:</p>
<p>A civil war breaks the bonds of society and governments, or at least suspends
                    their force and effect. It produces in the nation two independent parties who
                    consider each other as enemies, and acknowledge no common judge. Those two
                    parties, therefore, must necessarily be considered as thenceforward
                    constituting, at least for a time, two separate bodies, two distinct societies.
                    Though one of the parties may have been to blame in breaking the unity of the
                    State, and resisting the lawful authority, they are not the less divided in
                    fact. Besides, who shall judge them? Who shall pronounce on which side the right
                    or the wrong lies? On earth they have no common superior. They stand, therefore,
                    in precisely the same predicament as two nations who engage in a contest, and
                    being unable to come to an agreement, have recourse to arms. This being the
                    case, it is evident that the common laws of war - those maxims of humanity,
                    moderation and honor commonly observed - ought to be observed by both parties in
                    every civil war. For the same reasons which render the observance of those
                    maxims a matter of obligation between State and State, it becomes equally and
                    even more necessary in the unhappy circumstances of the two incensed parties
                    lacerating their common country. Should the sovereign conceive he has a right to
                    hang up his prisoners as rebels, the opposite party will make refusals; or, to
                    destroy their country, they will retaliate. The Duke of Alva made it a practice
                    to condemn to death every prisoner he took from the Confederates in the
                    Netherlands. They, on their part, retaliated, and at length compelled him to
                    respect the law of nations and the rules of war in his conduct toward them.</p>
<p>The above the rule and example of nations, and applying it to this case, I think
                    that any one can understand it.</p>
