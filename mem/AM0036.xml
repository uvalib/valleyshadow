                <p>At a recent meeting, on October 16, in Staunton, <abbr expan="Virginia"
                    >Va.</abbr>, the surviving veterans of the Stonewall Brigade elected <abbr
                        expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> H. J. Williams, of Augusta County, the oldest
                    field officer of the brigade now living, President. As the beginning of the war
                        <abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Williams was captain, and for bravery and
                    efficiency was promoted to colonel. Mr. W. W. B. Gallagher, of Charleston, <abbr
                        expan="West Virginia">W. Va.</abbr>, was chosen Vice President, and Thomas
                    B. Woodward of Staunton, Secretary. A beautiful poem was read by Augusta
                    County's poet and author, <abbr expan="Honorable">Hon.</abbr> A. C. Gordon.</p>
                <p>Resolutions of sympathy for <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> James A. Walker,
                    who is now in very poor health, were adopted. <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr>
                    Walker was the commander in the latter part of the war of the Stonewall Brigade.
                    He is much revered by the old veterans.</p>
                <p>A resolution was passed making permanent the Stonewall Brigade as an
                    organization, and fixing Staunton as its permanent meeting place, and provision
                    was made for annual meetings.</p>
                <p>After the meeting adjourned there was another meeting of the surviving veterans
                    in general, in which meeting <abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> William T.
                    Poague, formerly commander of the Rockbridge Battery, delivered into the custody
                    of D. W. Drake, sergeant major of the first regiment of cavalry, the regimental
                    flag of that regiment which was carried by that regiment through the war, and
                    which was brought home by James Poague, from Appomattox. Since his death it had
                    been in the custody of his mother. Appropriate addresses were made by Colonel
                    Poague, and on behalf of Mr. Drake in accepting custody of the flag.</p>
