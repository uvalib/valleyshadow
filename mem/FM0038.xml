                <p>In 1914, Kauffman's Progressive reprints this 1862 article that describes the
                    hospitals in the Greencastle area, commenting that all wounded are treated
                    alike, including Southerners, and that Southerners admit that Northerners treat
                    prisoners better.</p>

            <div1 type="article" id="d5">
                <p>There are four large hospitals filled with the wounded, viz: The Seminary, Union
                    Hotel, Church and Court House, The patients, of course, are not so comfortably,
                    situated as they would be at home, still they are better off than might have
                    been expected. The inmates of these numbered nearly 100, but a good many have
                    since been removed to Frederick, Maryland, and other places. But two or three
                    persons at a time were permitted to visit the hospital, our party <orig
                        reg="separated">seperated</orig>, and a few of us went to the Seminary,
                    while the rest visited the Union and other places. On the first floor, there
                    were probably twenty-five men lying on mattresses and beds made on the floor.
                    Some were wounded in the arms, others in the legs, some in the mouth, while
                    others were wounded in the more vital parts of the body. How they looked can be
                    better imagined than described. It was the most awful sight we ever witnessed.
                    In one corner was a Pennsylvanian; next him a volunteer from Ohio, or Indiana,
                    they were brought in from the field.</p>
                <p>No regiment or state distinction is made-all are treated exactly alike. In some
                    of the hospitals there are a few Confederates, they too, secure the same
                    treatment. This is an illustrious example for the Southern to <orig reg="follow"
                        >fellow</orig>. The Rebels acknowledge that we are kinder to them, than the
                    chivalry are to our wounded in their hands. The men were all glad to see us.
                    Papers were distributed among them, and they expressed themselves highly pleased
                    that the ladies of Greencastle had remembered them. Up to the morning of the
                    30th <abbr expan="ultimate">ulto.</abbr>, not over ninety Federals had died
                    including those killed on the battlefield.</p>
                <p>In times of peace, Winchester must have looked beautifully, especially in summer.
                    The long rows of shade trees on the walks, the <orig reg="magnificent"
                        >magnificient</orig> private residences, the stately public buildings, the
                    showy yards, all cause the visitor to look on the old town with admiration.
                    What, with gas works, water works, &amp;c., it makes fair <orig
