<h3 class="section-head">Franklin: "Chapter XLVI. Political Conditions in 1861.," by Alexander
                            K. McClure, 1905</h3>
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> McClure describes the strong anti-war sentiment in Pennsylvania in 1861 and the
                    political difficulties faced by the People's and Republican parties. He
                    discusses their strategy of alignment with War Democrats and describes how he
                    and other Republicans stonewalled an investigation that might have helped the
                    Democrats and thereby hindered the Lincoln administration in the war effort.</p>
<p>THE adjournment of the Legislature of 1861 left the State in a most confused and
                    unpromising political condition. Pennsylvania at that time was not a Republican
                    State. If Curtin had been nominated as a distinct Republican candidate for
                    Governor in 1860 his defeat would have been inevitable, and it was only by
                    holding the old Whigs, the Know Nothings, the radical Republicans and the
                    anti-slavery Democrats in some sort of united battle line under the flag of the
                    People's party that the defeat of the Democrats was assured in 1860 and in the
                    two previous years.</p>
<p>In the positive Republican States the war was popular, but in Pennsylvania, with
                    the Democrats next to solid against coercing the South by war, most of the Know
                    Nothings cherishing the same convictions,  and a very large
                    proportion of the Republicans unwilling to accept fratricidal war unless it
                    should be absolutely unavoidable, our State did not present the earnestness in
                    support of the war policy of the government that was exhibited in Ohio, New York
                    and the New England States. The disastrous defeat at Bull Run in June and the
                    failure of the army to gain any important achievements until after the election
                    in the fall of 1861, gave us next to a hopeless political condition in
                    Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Fortunately there were no State officers to be elected and no State convention to
                    be held to embarrass us by the declarations of our platform. The same political
                    conditions existed in Indiana and Illinois, but fortunately neither of them had
                    State officers to be elected, although Illinois elected members to a
                    constitutional convention in which the Democrats had a large majority. In New
                    York the opposition to the Democracy united, as they had done in Pennsylvania,
                    on three of the four State officers to be chosen, and elected them by over
                    100,000 majority, but on the office of canal commissioner the Republicans
                    refused to accept the Union candidate, who was practically the Know Nothing
                    representative, and the Democrats filled that office by a majority of nearly
                    20,000. Ohio elected Tod, Union Republican, Governor, by 55,000, and Maryland
                    elected Bradford, Union, Governor, with a decided Union majority in both
                    branches of the Legislature.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania the contest was only for members of the Legislature and county
                    offices, and with the discordant elements which made up the People's party and
                    the rebellious feeling against the record of the last Legislature, especially in
                    the repeal of the tonnage tax, the political conditions in the State seemed
                    utterly hopeless for the Republicans. </p>
<p>Having been chairman of the People's State committee in the State and National
                    contests of 1860, my position continued until a new State convention met with
                    power to fill the place. With a discordant party that could not be made
                    cohesive, and the grievous disappointments because of the army's defeat, with
                    Pennsylvania's exposed condition as a border State, there was very general
                    unrest and distrust throughout the Commonwealth. I was left practically in
                    charge of the party organization, with no State convention to relieve me of my
                    responsible duties, or to declare the policy of the party.</p>
<p>The only important officers to be chosen at the election of that year were
                    members of the Legislature. It was most important that the Legislature should be
                    held in harmony with the administration, but very early in the year it became
                    evident that only by extraordinary efforts and combinations could the control of
                    the house be maintained. The landslides of 1859 and '60 had made the senate
                    largely Republican, but it was of vital moment to hold control of the house, and
                    after giving the State a most careful investigation by direct inquiry with
                    reliable men in every county, I was fully satisfied that unless we could make a
                    combination with the new element of War Democrats, the Democrats would elect a
                    majority of the popular branch of the legislature.</p>
<p>There were a half-dozen or more legislative districts which could be carried only
                    with the aid of the Democrats who preferred loyalty to the government to loyalty
                    to the party, and after the State had been fully covered by inquiries to and
                    answers from the most reliable men, I proposed to Governor Curtin that we should
                    assure control of the house by nominating a number of prominent War Democrats in
                    Republican or doubtful districts. The matter was fully discussed 
                    and the plan approved. I hastened to inaugurate it by calling an unusually early
                    convention in my own county of Franklin, and placed at the head of the
                    Republican ticket ex-Surveyor General John Rowe, who had just retired from the
                    office of surveyor general to which he had been elected by the Democrats, but he
                    had never, in any way, severed his relations with his party. There were then a
                    number of very positive supporters of the war among the Democrats, and Major
                    Rowe was one of them.</p>
<p>When the People's Union convention of Franklin County led off with a Democrat of
                    State reputation as the Republican nominee for the Legislature, without asking
                    any pledges from him other than to give loyal support to the government, like
                    movements were made in a number of the legislative districts. John Scott,
                    afterwards Republican United States Senator, but then a Democratic leader in
                    Huntingdon, and a positive supporter of the war, was nominated by the
                    Republicans in Huntingdon, and Cyrus L. Pershing, another leading Democrat in
                    Cambria, who had been a Democratic member of the house, and who, later, served
                    with eminent distinction for many years as president judge of Schuylkill County,
                    was made the Republican candidate in Cambria, and Mr. Pfoutz, another Democrat,
                    was made a Republican candidate in Adams.</p>
<p>This liberal action on the part of the Republicans brought to the support of
                    legislative candidates a large Democratic war element, and every one of the
                    Democrats thus nominated by the Republicans was elected. As between the old
                    parties the majority of the members elected to the house were Democrats, but
                    enough War Democrats were chosen to enable them to hold the balance of power,
                    and the house was fortunately organized by a combination with the 
                    Republicans and War Democrats, with Major Rowe, from my own county, elected
                    speaker.</p>
<p>William H. Armstrong, of Lycoming, then the leading attorney in the West Branch
                    region, was a member of the house and was the logical candidate of the
                    Republican or People's party for the speakership, and his high character and
                    ability made him the party leader without dispute; but, appreciating, as he did,
                    the necessity of bringing the War Democrats into hearty accord with the
                    administration, State and National, he voluntarily declined to be a candidate
                    for speaker and supported the combination that gave the War Democrats the
                    speakership.</p>
<p>Major Rowe was not new in legislative duties, as he had been twice elected by the
                    Democrats to the house from Franklin County in 1852-53. He was a man thoroughly
                    fitted for the position, and his unblemished integrity and always courteous
                    discharge of the duties of the chair made him one of the most popular of the
                    many presiding officers of the body.</p>
<p>But for this combination made between the Republicans and the War Democrats, by
                    which prominent War Democrats were placed on the Republican ticket, the popular
                    branch of the Legislature would certainly have been Democratic and serious
                    embarrassment would have been suffered in the effort to give cordial legislative
                    support to the National government and the war.</p>
<p>The revolt against the bill repealing the tonnage tax of the Pennsylvania
                    Railroad contributed very largely to aid the Democrats in the contest of 1861,
                    and the new Legislature was overwhelmingly in favor of repealing the act of the
                    previous Legislature releasing the Pennsylvania corporation from tonnage taxes.
                    Certainly three-fourths of the members of the house were in favor of such
                    repeal; in the senate on the  direct question of the repeal the
                    vote stood twenty-two for repeal to eleven against it, and this ebullition of
                    popular hostility, inspired chiefly by deep-seated prejudice against all
                    corporate interests, was directed against a policy that was absolutely
                    indispensable to our State unless we desired to drive the entire commerce from
                    the teeming wealth of the West away from Philadelphia, our great commercial
                    emporium. There never was a measure before the Legislature of the State that was
                    more clearly right in every feature of its merits, and it was an imperious
                    necessity, unless we decided to exclude the great commerce of the West entirely
                    from the use of our railways and of our leading city as an important center of
                    Western trade; but with all these facts facing intelligent legislators the house
                    was wildly enthusiastic on the question of the repeal, and it would have been
                    utterly idle to attempt to prevent it.</p>
<p>I have already stated in a former chapter how the repeal passed the house by a
                    four-fifths vote and was defeated in the Senate by legislative strategy; but
                    intense as was the interest felt in both branches on the question of repealing
                    the tonnage taxes, still greater interest was exhibited on every hand by the
                    movement to investigate the alleged corrupt methods employed to pass the bill in
                    the Legislature at the previous session.</p>
<p>It was known before the Legislature met that the demand for investigation would
                    come from William Hopkins, of Washington, an old, experienced legislator, and a
                    man of much more than ordinary ability and unfaltering integrity. He was a
                    candidate for the Democratic nomination for Governor, and, while he was not of
                    the class of demagogues who would have inaugurated an investigation without
                    believing that it was imperatively demanded, it was certainly ex-pected by himself and his friends that the exhaustive investigation and
                    fearless report he must make would not fail to aid him greatly in his contest.</p>
<p>Abreast with him in the movement was Thomas Williams, one of the most brilliant
                    members of the Allegheny bar, who had previously served in the senate, and who
                    was one of the foremost leaders in the Allegheny repudiation movement against
                    the Pennsylvania Railroad; and when Hopkins made motion for the appointment of a
                    committee it was promptly seconded by Williams, which assured their appointment
                    on the committee, in obedience to parliamentary rules.</p>
<p>It was well known that Hopkins and Williams were strongly prejudiced against the
                    Pennsylvania corporation, and the selection of the five other members of the
                    committee became a matter of more than usual importance. I had very close
                    personal and political relations with Speaker Rowe, who was from my own county,
                    and he well understood that the earnest efforts I had made for the passage of
                    the bill repealing the tonnage tax in the previous Legislature made me extremely
                    anxious to sustain the measure, and prevent its sincere supporters from
                    suffering by an investigation that might aim at a desperate political lay to
                    inflame popular prejudice rather than to meet the issue in a spirit of manliness
                    and justice. He informed me that he would appoint any five members of the house
                    I named to make up the full committee, provided, however, that no one suggested
                    for the position had supported the measure in the last Legislature, or was in
                    any degree lacking in ability or reputation. What he desired was a thoroughly
                    able committee, the names of whose members would inspire general confidence in
                    the integrity of the inquiry. </p>
<p>Colonel Scott, who was more directly interested in the proposed investigation
                    than any other person in the State, had given very careful attention to the
                    question, and he named a dozen members of the house, not one of whom had made a
                    record in support of the repeal of the tonnage tax, and all of whom were men of
                    unblemished reputation and above the average of the intelligence of the house,
                    while most of them were lawyers of high legal attainments and standing in their
                    profession. Five of the twelve men thus named were appointed by the speaker, and
                    it was conceded on all sides that no abler or more reputable committee of
                    investigation was ever appointed by the Legislature.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that while Chairman Hopkins and Williams, of Allegheny,
                    were determined to make the investigation a battle to the death against the
                    Pennsylvania Railroad, the five additional members of the committee not only
                    shared none of the prejudices and destructive purposes of Hopkins and Williams,
                    but were in hearty and honest sympathy with the progressive movement inaugurated
                    by the law whose passage was to be inquired into.</p>
<p>It was not difficult for the committee to prove that more than questionable
                    methods had been employed in the passage of the bill, simply because the bill
                    could be passed in no other way. It was not a battle against intelligent
                    conviction that had to be corrupted to accomplish legislative results; it was a
                    battle in which intelligent conviction was overwhelmed by a tidal wave of
                    popular prejudice cherished in utter ignorance of, or indifference to, the
                    highest commercial and industrial advancement of the State. A powerful lobby was
                    employed, and each member of it in turn was called before the committee. Most of
                    them were probably severely economical in the measure of truth they gave to the
                    committee, but it was impossible  for them to do less than to
                    establish the fact that disreputable means had to be employed to give success to
                    the measure.</p>
<p>Colonel Scott was then in the employ of the government as Assistant Secretary of
                    War, and was generally on the wing looking after the transportation of troops
                    and supplies, and opening or repairing railway lines. Williams, who was
                    violently aggressive in his hostility to the Pennsylvania Railroad, and believed
                    that he had reached the point when he could practically accomplish its
                    destruction, insisted that Colonel Scott should be subpoenaed to testify before
                    the committee. It was unanimously agreed to by the committee, and the subpoena
                    was delivered to the sergeant-at-arms of the house. He at once proceeded to
                    Washington, where he found that Colonel Scott was absent attending to his
                    official duties in some part of the army in Virginia.</p>
<p>The officer, learning of Scott's location, hastened to meet him, and after a very
                    full chat about the condition of things at Harrisburg, and receiving suggestions
                    which were to be delivered to some of Scott's friends at home, the
                    sergeant-at-arms returned and reported that he had made diligent search for the
                    person named in the subpoena, but had not been able to find him. Ten days or two
                    weeks later the same officer was dispatched by the committee to find Colonel
                    Scott and serve the subpoena upon him. The officer was a very close friend of
                    Colonel Scott's, and his second attempt to obtain service of the process of the
                    committee resulted precisely as did the first, and a few weeks later a third
                    attempt was made by the sergeant-at-arms, under orders from the committee, to
                    serve the subpoena upon Colonel Scott, resulting just as did the previous
                    efforts.</p>
<p>Williams became suspicious of the fidelity of the  officer of the
                    house, and decided that he would make a bold movement to capture Colonel Scott
                    himself. He was well acquainted with Secretary Stanton, who had then succeeded
                    Cameron as Secretary of War, as they were old acquaintances at the Pittsburg bar
                    in their earlier days, and he telegraphed to Secretary Stanton inquiring when he
                    could meet Colonel Scott personally at the War Office in Washington. This
                    dispatch was sent on Thursday, and Stanton promptly replied that Williams could
                    meet Colonel Scott at his office in the War Department at ten o'clock on the
                    following Saturday.</p>
<p>Williams was wildly enthusiastic in his prosecution of the case that amounted
                    really to a persecution of all who were connected with the Pennsylvania
                    corporation, and on receipt of Stanton's despatch, he announced in the house
                    that the committee would no longer have to make fruitless search for Colonel
                    Scott, as he was to meet him in person at the War Office on the following
                    Saturday, and would have the sergeant-at-arms with him to serve the process.</p>
<p>There were very potential reasons why Colonel Scott should not appear before that
                    committee, even beyond every consideration relating to more personal interests.
                    The battle against the Pennsylvania Railroad and against the repeal of the
                    tonnage tax had become the chief political stock in trade of the Democracy, and
                    a triumph of the Democracy at that time in Pennsylvania meant a deliverance from
                    the most important State of the Union against the war policy of the Lincoln
                    administration. In considering what should be done in an emergency so grave, I
                    can say with the utmost frankness that no one was consulted who was in personal
                    fear of an honest and thorough investigation, but at a conference of a dozen or
                    more men responsibly charged with the direction of political affairs on the  Republican side, held in the evening after Williams had made his
                    announcement in the house, it was decided that Scott should not be permitted to
                    be brought to the bar of the house as Williams had openly threatened.</p>
<p>Wilmot was then a member of the United States Senate, having been chosen to fill
                    the vacancy made by Senator Cameron entering the cabinet, and his election to
                    the Senate, after an earnest contest, in which State Senator Ketchum was his
                    chief competitor, was accomplished by an arrangement with a number of Wilmot's
                    friends in the Legislature, who gave their support to the repeal of the tonnage
                    tax in return for Scott's successful efforts for Wilmot's promotion. Congress
                    was then in session and Wilmot in Washington, and I wrote a confidential letter
                    to him fully stating the political necessities which confronted us, all of which
                    he would well understand and requested him on receipt of the letter to go
                    immediately to President Lincoln and present the naked truth.</p>
<p>Williams and the sergeant-at-arms took the noon train at Harrisburg for
                    Washington on Friday, and I selected a trusted messenger to go on the same train
                    with them and deliver my letter to Wilmot, who, in obedience to a telegram,
                    would be waiting for him at Willard's Hotel on his arrival. The letter was
                    delivered to Wilmot, and he immediately proceeded to the President, gave him my
                    letter and presented the situation with absolute candor. Lincoln at once sent
                    for Secretary Stanton, who promptly appeared, and the matter was presented to
                    him.</p>
<p>It was one of Stanton's peculiarities that when an extreme but somewhat irregular
                    necessity was presented to him, he would promptly accept the responsibility and
                    find his own way of meeting it, but as a rule his methods were most effectual.
                    He expressed no  opinion as to what he would do in the matter if it
                    were an open question for him to decide, but he at once answered that a sudden
                    and unexpected order he had just issued in the early part of the evening to
                    Colonel Scott, then at Fortress Monroe, in itself solved the whole problem. He
                    said that the Southwestern army was suffering beyond measure for want of a
                    master of transportation, and he found it necessary, from complaints made to him
                    about the halting movements of Halleck's several commands, to order Colonel
                    Scott to leave Fortress Monroe at once and proceed directly to the Southwest and
                    report to General Halleck.</p>
<p>I much doubt whether Secretary Stanton had issued the order or thought of issuing
                    the order transferring Colonel Scott, until after his conference with Lincoln
                    and Wilmot, as no such thing had been spoken of in any government circles up to
                    that time, but doubtless a master transportationist was needed in the Southwest,
                    and he saw that such an order would not only serve the Southwestern army, but
                    would serve other important purposes as well, and Scott certainly received the
                    order in time to leave Fortress Monroe on Friday, passed through Washington
                    Friday night without stopping, and, having been advised of his movement, I met
                    him at three o'clock on Saturday morning in the railroad depot at Harrisburg,
                    and had twenty minutes' conference with him while the train tarried. He then
                    hurried on to the Southwest and remained with Halleck and Pope until some three
                    or four months after the adjournment of the Legislature.</p>
<p>On Saturday morning Williams and the sergeant-at-arms leisurely breakfasted
                    together and then proceeded to the War Office to meet Colonel Scott just about
                    the time that Colonel Scott was breakfasting at Altoona. Stanton, of course,
                    received his old  friend with great cordiality, and after the usual
                    salutations Williams inquired how soon he could meet Colonel Scott. Stanton in
                    the blandest way said: "Is it personally important to you that you should meet
                    Colonel Scott?" To which Williams replied that it was of the utmost importance.</p>
<p>Stanton expressed profound regret that he was compelled, after having made the
                    appointment for Williams to meet Scott at the War Office, to order Colonel Scott
                    to start immediately for the Southwest, where great victories were lost by our
                    army for want of adequate transportation facilities. Next to Williams' hostility
                    to the Pennsylvania Railroad, his most intense resentment was against the South,
                    and, sadly as he was disappointed, he could not dispute the imperious character
                    of the duty Stanton had performed.</p>
<p>The investigation committe had gradually become
                    greatly conserved in its movements by the influence of the five men who were the
                    fellow-members of the committee with Hopkins and Williams. Instead of continuing
                    as a malignant crusade against the great corporation and greater commercial and
                    industrial interests of the State, it pursued its inquiry without passion,
                    vindicated its appointment by proving the employment of corrupt methods to pass
                    the measure, and made a dignified and temperate report, summing up the testimony
                    and condemning corrupt practices in legislation.</p>
<p>Williams made an effort to have the house permit the committee to sit during the
                    recess. That would have authorized them to follow Scott anywhere, but the house
                    responded by refusing the request, requiring the committee to make final report
                    and be discharged before the adjournment. Thus ended one of the bitterest
                    struggles I have ever witnessed in the Pennsylvania Legislature.</p>
