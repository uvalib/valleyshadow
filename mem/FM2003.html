<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> Excerpts from this 613-page book by a long-time Chambersburg resident provide
                    first-hand glimpses of Lincoln's famous address at Gettysburg and a detailed
                    description of the burning of Chambersburg by Confederate forces. Hoke looks
                    closely into the causes behind Chambersburg's destruction, reprinting letters
                    from soldiers involved in the action and concluding that the incident was the
                    fault of brutal Confederate bushwackers in the Shenandoah Valley who set off a
                    vicious cycle of destruction and retaliation.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION.</p>
<p>No battle field on earth is so well preserved and marked as is that of
                    Gettysburg. Little and Big Round Top, East Cemetery Hill and Ridge Culp's and
                    Wolff Hill, Seminary and Oak Ridge, have become immortal, and will endure while
                    time itself lasts. The lines of the two great armies, the positions occupied by
                    the various corps, divisions, brigades, and regiments, and the places where
                    heroic deeds were performed and where distinguished men fell, are being marked
                    by tablets and monuments of enduring marble and granite. In this commendable
                    work, it affords us pleasure to state, Confederates as well as Federals are
                    engaged. The stone fences and huge boulders, used as defenses, and many of the
                    breast-works thrown up at the time, also remain, and will be preserved as long
                    as time and the elements of nature will permit. The various states whose troops
                    participated in the memorable battle which occurred there, as well as brigades,
                    regiments, and companies, are vying with each other, not only to mark for future
                    ages where gallant men fought and where patriots died, but to make as beautiful
                    as possible the entire field where the life of our great Government was assured.
                    It is eminently proper, then, that every fact of historic value connected with
                    the great episode which culminated upon that field should not only be preserved
                    but placed upon record in its proper connection. This the survivors of the
                    period of those stirring events owe to the generations who are yet to come.</p>
<p>The author of this work has attempted to discharge, in a measure, the duty
                    indicated in the foregoing. His qualifications for the task he has (end of page
                    xxix) undertaken may be stated thus: he resided in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania,
                    during the entire period of the War of the Rebellion, and for a score of years
                    previous and ever since; he not only witnessed all the armed hosts, Federal and
                    Confederate, which passed through that place, but had access to their camps and
                    hospitals; he preserved important papers, and kept an account of events with the
                    dates of their occurrence; he visited the field of battle and noted facts and
                    incidents; he has corresponded with others, both Federals and Confederates,
                    competent to impart important information; and he has made it a point to read
                    and preserve everything relating to the subject, which has come under his
                    notice. The material thus carefully gathered he has compared, classified, and
                    placed upon record in the following pages. He has been especially careful to be
                    exact in the facts stated, and in the dates given. Errors may have crept into
                    this record, but every precaution has been taken to secure entire accuracy. If
                    he has not succeeded in giving the public such a history of the subject as its
                    importance demands, he has at least rescued from oblivion much valuable
                    historical matter, which, without this humble effort, would have been forever
                    lost.</p>
<p>It will be seen in the perusal of this work that the published statements of both
                    Federal and Confederate writers, relating to the invasion of Pennsylvania and
                    the battle of Gettysburg, have been used. This has been done that the fullest
                    and fairest history of the whole may be secured, for both sides are equally
                    entitled to a hearing. Besides this, events which transpired within the
                    Confederate lines, and which Confederates only could detail, are of equal
                    importance in an impartial and reliable history with those which occurred within
                    the Federal lines, and which Federals only could narrate. For the reasons thus
                    stated, as well as to preserve in a permanent form some of the many excellent
                    and interesting articles, written for the newspapers and magazines, by
                    eye-witnesses and participants, I have drawn largely upon this class of writers.</p>
<p>In matters of dispute, or where differences of opinion have prevailed, I have
                    endeavored to be impartial; and in every case, where it was at all possible,
                    both sides have been accorded a hearing.</p>
<p>The writer has not only sought to be impartial, but also unpartisan. (end of page
                    xxx). He could not, however, conceal the fact that he wrote from the standpoint
                    of a Unionist, and that his sympathies were, and ever must be, with those who
                    stood for the maintenance of the Government. For those who arrayed themselves
                    upon the opposite side, he has but feelings of kindness. The time has come for
                    all ill feeling to be entirely laid aside and forgotten. In this spirit this
                    history has been written; and its author disclaims any other reason for the task
                    he has undertaken, than to place upon record a fair and truthful account of
                    events in which both the late contestants have an equal interest. If, then, in
                    the following pages, any injustice has been done, or if a feeling or expression
                    inconsistent with an impartial history, intended for the whole country, and for
                    all time to come, has found place, the reader will kindly attribute it to
                    inadvertence rather than to any disposition to perpetuate the bitterness and
                    estrangement of the past.</p>

<p>The battle of Gettysburg, as is universally conceded, was the turning point in
                    the great war of the rebellion, for from it the ultimate failure of the cause
                    for which the South fought was assured. And as that battle was the culmination,
                    the crisis of the war, so the last great effort of the Confederate chieftain,
                    when he hurled fifteen thousand of his choicest troops against the Federal line,
                    was the culmination, the supreme crisis of that battle. The rebellion at that
                    point reached its high-water mark, and from that period it gradually receded.
                    That charge, then, was the supreme crisis in our country's history, and the
                    turning point in its destiny. It failed, and with its failure the fact was
                    demonstrated that a government founded upon oppression and wrong, could not
                    succeed in the light of the civilization and Christianity of this age. The
                    Republic was saved, redeemed, baptized, and consecrated anew to the coming ages.</p>

<p>GETTYSBURG, THE NATION'S SHRINE.</p>
<p>"On Fame's eternal camping ground<br>Their silent tents are spread,<br>And
                    Glory guards, with solemn round,<br>The bivouac of the dead."</p>
<p>As soon as the result of the series of engagements between the Federal and
                    Confederate armies at Gettysburg was known throughout the country, people from
                    all sections flocked to that place. In traversing the field of conflict the
                    evidences of the tremendous struggle were visible in all directions. Disabled
                    cannon, abandoned and captured arms, broken down fences, trampled and ruined
                    fields of grass and grain, pools of blood, dead and wounded men, and the bloated
                    and offensive carcasses of horses, were some of the visible results. The hearts
                    of patriots were saddened and their feelings shocked to see the remains of the
                    brave men who had yielded up their lives that the Nation might live, because of
                    the necessary haste with which they were interred, in many instances but
                    partially covered with earth. These partly covered bodies were scattered for
                    miles over ground that would soon be cultivated. The graves which were marked
                    were only temporarily so, and the marks would soon decay or be obliterated, and
                    all traces of the sacred (end of page 520) dust be entirely lost. Humanity
                    shuddered at the sight, and patriotism revolted at such desecration. The idea
                    then was suggested of purchasing a suitable piece of ground upon some elevated
                    place, and gathering these men from all parts of the field and decently
                    interring them side by side. Mr. David Wills, a citizen of Gettysburg, submitted
                    a proposition to effect the purpose to his Excellency, Governor Andrew G.
                    Curtin, in a letter dated July 24th, 1863; and the governor, with the promptness
                    and zeal for the cause of the Union, and the welfare and comfort of the
                    soldiers, which he had always shown, approved of the design, and appointed Mr.
                    Wills as agent to carry out the project. Mr. Wills at once opened correspondence
                    with the governors of other states, which had soldiers dead upon the field, and
                    they all with great promptness responded and seconded the plan. About seventeen
                    acres of ground on Cemetery Hill, at the apex of the triangular line of battle
                    of the Union army, was purchased and the title made to the State of
                    Pennsylvania. No more beautiful or appropriate place for the gallant heroes who
                    died upon that field, could be found than the one selected. It is high and
                    prominent. It was the center of the Federal position. Upon it were planted the
                    batteries which thundered forth death and destruction to the foe; and it was
                    there that the awful fire of Lee's one hundred and twenty guns was concentrated
                    during that fearful two hours' artillery duel, which preceded Pickett's great,
                    but wild and disastrous charge. Lots in this cemetery were gratuitously given to
                    each State having dead on the field. It was arranged that the expenses for the
                    removal and re-interment of the dead, the laying out, orna[end of page
                    521]menting, and enclosing of the grounds, erecting a lodge for the keeper, and
                    constructing a suitable monument, should be borne by the several States, and
                    assessed in proportion to their population, as indicated by their representation
                    in Congress.</p>
<p>The Soldiers' National Cemetery is enclosed by a well built stone wall,
                    surmounted with heavy dressed capping stones. This wall extends along the south,
                    west, and north sides of the grounds. The division fence between it and the
                    local cemetery of the town is of iron. The lodge for the residence of the keeper
                    is a beautiful structure, and the front fence and gate-way are of ornamental
                    iron work. The grounds have been graded, and are adorned with many beautiful
                    trees, shrubbery, and flowers. The burial-place proper is semi-circular in form.
                    In the center of this semi-circle stands the National Monument. The grounds from
                    this center slope off gradually in every direction. They are laid out in lots,
                    each State proportioned in size to the number of its dead. Each of these lots is
                    divided into sections, with a space of four feet for a walk between the
                    sections. There are also spaces set apart for the Regulars, as also for those
                    whose identity could not be distinguished. Many of those who fell in the first
                    day's engagement are among the latter; they lay either unburied and exposed to
                    the sun and rain, until the Monday following the battle, or were but slightly
                    covered. The outer division of the section is lettered "A," and so on in
                    alphabetical order. As the observer stands in the center of the semi-circle,
                    facing the circumference, the burials are commenced at the right hand of the
                    section in each lot, and the graves are num- (end of page 523) regularly. A
                    register is kept of the number, name, regiment, and company of the occupant of
                    each grave. Two feet of space is allowed to each, and they are laid with their
                    heads toward the center of the semi-circle. At the head of the graves there is a
                    stone wall, built up from the bottom as a foundation for the head-stones, which
                    are placed along the whole length of each section; and on which, opposite each
                    grave, is engraved the name, regiment, and the company of the deceased. These
                    headstones are all alike in size, the design being wholly adapted to a
                    symmetrical order, and one which combines simplicity and durability. The remains
                    of the soldiers were taken up and re-interred with great care. Every precaution
                    was (end of page 524) taken to identify the unmarked graves, and also to prevent
                    the marked graves from losing their identity by the defacement of the original
                    temporary boards, on which the names were written or cut by their comrades in
                    arms. The graves being all numbered, the numbers are registered in a
                    record-book, with the name, company, and regiment. This register will ever
                    designate the graves and preserve the identity of the occupants. The coffins and
                    head-stones were furnished by the Government, and the cemetery is kept in order
                    by persons appointed and paid by the same. A careful account was also taken and
                    kept of each article found in the pockets, or about the person of the deceased.</p>
<p>Not all, however, who fell at this place in the sacred cause of Freedom were
                    interred here. Many were taken away by their friends and buried among their own
                    kindred; and many others who were wounded and taken to their homes, or to
                    distant hospitals, and died there, were laid away to rest where they died. Among
                    the killed who were removed was the brave, the lamented Reynolds. His body was
                    borne to his native city, Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where, amidst his own
                    kindred, he sleeps. A beautiful monument, however, has been erected by his
                    comrades, in the National Cemetery, near the entrance, a view of which is shown
                    in our illustration.</p>
<p>But of all the gallant heroes who fell at Gettysburg, wherever they rest, it may
                    truthfully be said:</p>
<p>"They fell devoted, but undying;<br>Their very names the gale seems
                    sighing;<br>The rivers murmur of their name;<br>The woods are peopled with
                    their fame;<br>The silent tombstone, cold and gray, (end of page
                    525)<br>Claims kindred with their hallowed clay;<br>Their spirits wrap the
                    dusky mountains;<br>Their memory sparkles over the fountains;<br>The meanest
                    rill, the mightiest river,<br>Rolls mingling with their fame forever." </p>
<p>The Soldiers' National Monument, standing in this semicircle, is one of the most
                    beautiful works of art upon the continent. The whole rendering of the design is
                    intended to be purely historical, telling its own story, with such simplicity
                    that any discerning mind will readily comprehend its meaning and purpose.</p>
<p>The superstructure is sixty feet high, and consists of a massive granite
                    pedestal, twenty-five feet square at the base, crowned by a colossal statue,
                    representing the GENIUS OF LIBERTY. Standing upon a three quarter globe, she
                    raises with her right hand the victor's wreath of laurel, while with her left
                    she gathers up the folds of our national flag under which the victory has been
                    won.</p>
<p>Projecting from the angles of the pedestal are four buttresses, supporting an
                    equal number of allegorical statues representing, respectively, WAR, HISTORY,
                    PEACE, and PLENTY.</p>
<p>WAR is personified by a statue of the American soldier, who, resting from the
                    conflict, relates to HISTORY the story of the battle which this monument is
                    intended to commemorate.</p>
<p>HISTORY, in listening attitude, records with stylus and tablet the achievements
                    of the field, and the names of the honored dead.</p>
<p>PEACE is symbolized by a statue of the American mechanic, characterized by
                    appropriate accessories.</p>
<p>PLENTY is represented by a female figure, with a sheaf (end of page 526) of wheat
                    and fruits of the earth, typifying peace and abundance as the soldier's crowning
                    triumph.</p>
<p>Upon the panels of the main die between the statues are appropriate inscriptions,
                    one of which is the concluding part of President LINCOLN'S address upon the
                    occasion of the dedication of this cemetery, as follows:</p>
<p>"It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -
                    that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to the cause for which
                    they here gave the last full measure of devotion - that we here highly resolve
                    that the dead shall not have died in vain; that the nation shall, under God,
                    have a new birth of freedom, and that the government of the people, by the
                    people, and for the people, shall not perish from the earth."</p>
<p>The main die of the pedestal is octagonal in form, panelled upon each face. The
                    cornice and plinth above are also octagonal, and are heavily molded. Upon this
                    plinth rests an octagonal molded base, bearing upon its face, in high relief,
                    the National arms.</p>
<p>The upper die and cap are circular in form, the die being encircled by stars
                    equal in number with the States whose sons contributed their lives as the price
                    of the victory won at Gettysburg.</p>
<p>The ground thus purchased and set apart for the burial of those who fell at
                    Gettysburg in defense of the Government, was, on November 19th, 1863, solemnly
                    dedicated to this sacred purpose. There were present, beside a vast concourse of
                    people from all parts of the country, the President of the United States,
                    several members of his cabinet, the ministers of France and Italy, the governors
                    of several States, representatives of the army and navy, (end of page 528)
                    members of Congress, and many other distinguished persons. A stand or platform
                    was erected for the speakers and invited guests. This stand stood just where the
                    National Monument now stands. The exercises were opened by music by Birgfield's
                    band, after which followed an eloquent and impressive prayer by Rev. Thomas H.
                    Stockton, D.D., from which I make the following extracts:</p>
<p>"By this Altar of Sacrifice; on this Field of Deliverance; on this Mount of
                    Salvation; within the fiery and bloody line of the 'Munitions of Rocks,' looking
                    back to the dark days of fear and trembling, and to the rapture of relief that
                    came after, we multiply our thanksgivings, and confess our obligations to renew
                    and perfect our personal and social consecration to Thy service and glory.</p>
<p>"Oh, had it not been for God! For lo! our enemies, they came unresisted,
                    multitudinous, mighty, flushed with victory, and sure of success. They exulted
                    on our mountains; they revelled in our valleys; they feasted, they rested; they
                    slept, they awakened; they grew stronger, prouder, bolder, every day; they
                    spread abroad, they concentrated here; they looked beyond this horizon to the
                    stores of wealth, to the haunts of pleasure, and to the seats of power in our
                    capital and chief cities. They proposed to cast a chain of slavery around the
                    form of Freedom, binding life and death together forever. Their premature
                    triumph was the mockery of God and man. One more victory, and all was theirs!
                    But behind these hills was heard the feeble march of a smaller, but pursuing
                    host. Onward they hurried, day and night, for God and their country. Foot-sore,
                    way-worn, hungry, thirsty, faint, - but not in heart, - they came to dare all,
                    to bear all, and to do all (end of page 529) that is possible to heroes. And
                    Thou didst sustain them! At first they met the blast on the plain, and bent
                    before it like the trees in a storm. But then, led by Thy hand to these hills,
                    they took their stand upon the rocks and remained as firm and immovable as they.
                    In vain were they assaulted. All art, all violence, all desperation, failed to
                    dislodge them. Baffled, bruised, broken, their enemies recoiled, retired, and
                    disappeared. Glory to God for this rescue! But oh, the slain! In the freshness
                    and fulness of their young and manly life, with such sweet memories of father
                    and mother, brother and sister, wife and children, maiden and friends, they died
                    for us. From the coasts beneath the eastern sky, from the shores of northern
                    lakes and rivers, from the flowers of the western prairies, and from the homes
                    of the midway and border, they came here to die for us and for mankind. Alas,
                    how little we can do for them! We come with the humility of prayer, with the
                    pathetic eloquence of venerable wisdom, with the tender beauty of poetry, with
                    the plaintive harmony of music, with the honest tribute of our Chief Magistrate,
                    and with all this honorable attendance; but our best hope is in thy blessing, O
                    Lord, our God! O Father, bless us! Bless the bereaved, whether present or
                    absent; bless our sick and wounded soldiers and sailors; bless all our rulers
                    and people; bless our army and navy; bless the efforts for the suppression of
                    the rebellion; and bless all the associations of this day and place and scene
                    forever. As the trees are not dead, though their foliage is gone, so our heroes
                    are not dead, though their forms are fallen. In their proper personality they
                    are all with Thee. And the spirit of their example is here. It fills the air; it
                    fills our hearts. (end of page 530) And, long as time shall last, it will hover
                    in the skies and rest on the landscape; and the pilgrims of our own land, and
                    from all lands, will thrill with its inspiration, and increase and confirm their
                    devotion to liberty, religion, and God."</p>
<p>At the conclusion of this prayer, the Marine Band of Washington rendered
                    excellent and appropriate music, after which Hon. Edward Everett delivered an
                    able and elaborate address. Following this address a choir sang the hymn
                    composed specially for the occasion by B.B. French, Esq., some verses of which
                    are given at the close of this chapter. The President of the United States, the
                    honored and revered LINCOLN, then, amidst the tremendous applause of the
                    assembled multitude, arose and slowly advanced to the front of the platform and
                    delivered his celebrated dedicatory address, which was as follows:</p>
<p>"Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth upon this continent a
                    new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men
                    are created equal.</p>
<p>Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any
                    nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great
                    battle field of that war. We are met to dedicate a portion of it as a final
                    resting place of those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It
                    is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.</p>
<p>But in a larger sense we can not dedicate, we can not consecrate, we can not
                    hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here have
                    consecrated (end of page 531) it far above our power to add or detract. The
                    world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never
                    forget what they did here. It is for us, the living, rather to be dedicated here
                    to the unfinished work that they have thus so nobly carried on. It is rather for
                    us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us - that from these
                    honored dead we take increased devotion to the cause for which they gave the
                    last full measure of devotion - that we highly resolve that the dead shall not
                    have died in vain; that the nation shall, under God, have a new birth of
                    freedom, and that the government of the people, by the people, and for the
                    people, shall not perish from the earth."</p>
<p>The words of the president were uttered in slow and measured tones, and although
                    not heard by the large majority of the people present, the most profound silence
                    was observed daring their delivery. When he uttered the closing sentences, which
                    have become immortal, hiasizing each with a significant nod and jerk of his
                    head, - "," - it occurred
                    to the writer, who stood within a few feet of him, that those words were
                    destined to an imperishable immortality.</p>
<p>After the president's dedicatory address, a solemn dirge was sung, after which
                    the benediction was pronounced by Rev. H.L. Baugher, D.D.</p>
<p>The admiration of the people for President LINCOLN exceeded that ever bestowed
                    upon any other person within my knowledge. It was evidently not so much for him
                    personally, as . He was recognized
                    as the personification of the cause which was enshrined in every (end of page
                    532) patriot's heart, and for which the armies of the Union were contending. To
                    love the Union was to love Abraham Lincoln. To hate and defame him was the
                    acknowledged evidence of disloyalty. The honored head of the Nation, the humble
                    and unpretending man from Illinois, standing upon the ground where one of the
                    greatest battles of modern times occurred, and in which the existence and
                    destiny of the Government were in part decided, modestly received the willing
                    homage of the assembled thousands. The Man - the President - the Government -
                    the yet undecided peril to which it was exposed - the ground we were on - the
                    sleeping thousands all about us, whose blood had been poured out upon that soil
                    that the Nation might live, all conspired to make the occasion one never to be
                    forgotten.</p>
<p>During the twenty-three years that have elapsed since this ground was dedicated
                    to the sacred purpose of the interment of these honored dead, many improvements
                    have been made. Additional grounds have been purchased; avenues along the lines
                    held by the Federals have been laid out; tablets have been erected to mark the
                    places where corps, divisions, brigades, and regiments stood, and monuments
                    where distinguished men fell. States whose troops fought in this battle are
                    appropriating money for additional improvements, and in the years to come the
                    field of Gettysburg will increase in beauty and interest, and will be visited by
                    untold thousands.</p>
<p>Such was the origin of this final resting place for the remains of the heroic men
                    who fell upon the field of Gettysburg. Who can estimate the importance to the
                    race of their valor and heroism? They have fallen, but victory (end of page 533)
                    is ours - theirs enrollment upon the scroll of undying fame. They did not fight
                    in vain. Not for themselves, but for their children, for the race, for humanity,
                    for righteousness, for God, they gave themselves a willing sacrifice. Their
                    remains deserve the highest honor that a grateful people can bestow. Their deeds
                    will live in history long after their bodies have mouldered into dust; and the
                    place where they lie will be honored, protected, and preserved as a sad, but
                    sacred, memento of their heroic conduct. And, as was intimated in Dr. Stockton's
                    impressive prayer, the place where this great battle was fought, the ground
                    where the dust of the slain reposes, has become the Nation's shrine, and
                    pilgrims from our own land, and from all lands, will ever continue to visit it
                    to catch a new inspiration of freedom, and increase and confirm their devotion
                    to Liberty, to Religion, and to God.</p>
<p>In the Soldiers' National Cemetery at Gettysburg there are interred the bodies of
                    three thousand five hundred and fifty-five Union soldiers. They were from the
                    following states: Maine, one hundred and four; New Hampshire, forty-eight;
                    Vermont, sixty-one; Massachusetts, one hundred and fifty-nine; Rhode Island,
                    twelve; Connecticut, twenty-two; New York, eight hundred and sixty-six; New
                    Jersey, seventy-eight; Pennsylvania, five hundred and twenty-six; Delaware,
                    fifteen; Maryland, twenty-two; West Virginia, eleven; Ohio, one hundred and
                    thirty-one; Indiana, eighty; Illinois, six; Michigan, one hundred and
                    seventy-one; Wisconsin, seventy-three; Minnesota, fifty-two; United States
                    Regulars, one hundred and thirty-eight; Unknown, nine hundred and seventy-nine.
                    These fallen patriots having come together from the East, North, and (end of
                    page 534) West, and stood side by side under one flag, inspired by one spirit,
                    and fought for one cause, it is but right and proper that they should not be
                    divided in death, but rest in the ground hallowed by their valor and made sacred
                    by their blood. For them there is no more separation from home and loved ones at
                    their country's call, no more weary marches, no more digging of trenches, no
                    more charging into yawning chasms of death, no more painful wounds and sleepless
                    nights, and long and weary days in hospitals. All these are forever ended. On
                    this Altar of Sacrifice, this Mount of Salvation, this Field of Deliverance, and
                    surrounded by these Munitions of Rocks, let them rest until the Archangel's
                    clarion shall sound with a louder blast than that which summoned them to this
                    field of heroic deeds.</p>
<p>"'Tis holy ground -<br>This spot, where, in their graves,<br>Are placed our
                    country's braves,<br>Who fell in freedom's holy cause,<br>Fighting for
                    liberties and laws:<br>Let tears abound. </p>
<p>"Here where they fell,<br>Oft shall the widow's tears be shed;<br>Oft shall
                    fond parents mourn their dead;<br>The orphan here shall kneel and weep,<br>And
                    maidens where their lovers sleep,<br>Their woes to tell. </p>
<p>"Here let them rest:<br>And summer's heat and winter's cold<br>Shall glow and
                    freeze above their mould - <br>A thousand years shall pass away -<br>A nation
                    still shall mourn their clay,<br>Which now is blest." </p>

<p>THE BURNING OF CHAMBERSBURG, PENNSYLVANIA.</p>
<p>In the campaign of the spring of 1864, General Hunter succeeded General Sigel in
                    the Shenandoah Valley, and by the orders of General Grant, advanced upon
                    Lynchburg, Virginia, with the view of destroying the enemy's resources at that
                    place. On the 5th of June he met the enemy at Piedmont and defeated him. Forming
                    a junction on the 8th, with Crook and Averell at Staunton, he moved directly on
                    Lynchburg by way of Lexington, reaching the latter place on June l0th. Up to
                    this time Hunter had been very successful, and the destruction of the enemy's
                    supplies and manufactories had been very great. To meet this movement General
                    Lee sent General Early with his corps, a part of which reached Lynchburg in
                    advance of Hunter. After some skirmishing on the 17th and 18th, General Hunter,
                    owing to a want of ammunition, declined to give battle, and found himself under
                    the necessity of retiring from the place, and abandoning the chief object of his
                    expedition. This want of ammunition, and consequent inability to meet the force
                    sent against him, compelled him to choose as the route of his return the way of
                    the Gauley and Kanawha rivers, thence up the Ohio River, and returning to
                    Harper's Ferry by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. This movement uncovered the
                    valley, and Early, after some show of pursuit upon the route Hunter had taken,
                    fell back to the valley and rapidly advanced toward the Potomac. Crossing this
                    river on Thursday, July 7th, he turned hastily toward the National Capital,
                    defeating the Federal force under General Lewis Wallace at the Monocacy River,
                    on Saturday, July 9th. On Tuesday, the 12th, the advance of his army came up in
                    front of the defenses of Washington, but finding them too strong to be carried,
                    and fearing that the gathering forces might cut his communications, Early, in
                    the morning of the 13th, fell back, recrossing the river at Edwards' Ferry, and
                    passing through Snicker's Gap with an immense train of plunder, which he had
                    gathered by the way, encamped about Martinsburg. The Federal force under General
                    Hunter, having arrived from the west, crossed the river and engaged Early, and
                    were finally compelled to recross and take position from Hancock, Maryland, to
                    Harper's Ferry, the main body being at the latter place. Each army had cavalry
                    stationed upon its flanks. The brigade of General John A. McCausland was placed
                    upon Early's left; the command of General Averell was upon the Federal right and
                    confronting McCausland. This was substantially (end of page 580) the situation
                    up to Thursday, July 28th. It is needless to say that the proximity of the
                    Confederates, and their bold and aggressive movements, caused intense excitement
                    and alarm all along the Southern border of the tier of counties immediately
                    threatened.</p>
<p>On Thursday, July 28th, General Early directed General McCausland to take his own
                    brigade of mounted infantry and the cavalry brigade of General Bradley T.
                    Johnson, the two numbering about two thousand nine hundred men, and proceed to
                    Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, and after capturing it, levy a tribute upon it of
                    one hundred thousand dollars in gold, or five hundred thousand dollars in United
                    States currency, and in default of the payment of either to burn the town. On
                    this same day these two brigades were assembled at or near Hammond's Mill, in
                    Berkeley County, West Virginia. During the ensuing night the Federal pickets on
                    the north side of the Potomac were captured, and in the early morning of Friday,
                    29th, the command crossed at Cherry Run and McCoy's fords, and with but little
                    opposition advanced by way of Clearspring and Mercersburg upon Chambersburg. The
                    first knowledge the citizens of the latter place had of the approach of the
                    enemy was at about half past twelve o'clock of this day, when a scene of
                    indiscribable [sic] confusion at once took place. The contents of the bank,
                    stores, shops, and many private houses were hurriedly removed and secreted, - an
                    experience which the people of that place, and other towns along the southern
                    border, had often undergone.</p>
<p>About ten o'clock at night the Confederate force came up to the high hills two
                    miles west of town. At this place they remained during the night, kept back
                    probably by the firing of a single gun, which, with a few men - all the soldiers
                    then at this place - had been sent to retard the approach of the enemy.</p>
<p>Chambersburg at this time was the head-quarters of the military district of the
                    Susquehanna, and although General Couch, its commander, had organized regiment
                    after regiment specially to guard the southern border, they were, as soon as
                    organized, ordered to Washington to meet the danger threatening that place. His
                    inability, then, to meet this emergency may be seen in the fact that during the
                    time Early was raiding Maryland and threatening the Capital, his whole available
                    force in the department did not exceed three hundred men, and at this time he
                    had but one hundred and thirty-five under his command, of whom but about forty,
                    including himself and staff, were in the town. It will thus be seen that while
                    the people of the southern border had a military department, well and ably
                    officered, they were without troops, and that too at one of the most threatening
                    periods of the war. (end of page 581)</p>
<p>At an early hour in the morning - Saturday, July 30th - General McCausland placed
                    about two thousand of his command in line upon a hill near the western suburb of
                    the town, and about one mile from its center. Six pieces of artillery were also
                    placed in position, and three shells were fired into the place without any
                    notice to the citizens. The remaining nine hundred of his force were sent into
                    the town, and the Court House bell was rung as a signal for the citizens to
                    assemble to hear his requisition. No response being made, a guard under Major
                    Harry Gilmore, of Baltimore, was sent around, who captured some six or eight of
                    our leading men and conducted them to the front of the Court House. Captain
                    Fitzhugh, McCausland's chief of staff, then read to them General Early's
                    requisition, demanding the immediate payment of one hundred thousand dollars in
                    gold, or five hundred thousand dollars in United States currency, and in default
                    of payment ordering the destruction of the town. This order stated that this
                    requisition and threatened burning were in retaliation for acts of destruction
                    committed by General Hunter in the Valley of Virginia, and specially naming some
                    half dozen dwellings which he had burned. The money demanded was not, and could
                    not be paid, for the reason that there was nothing like the amount demanded
                    remaining in the town. Besides the citizens did not feel like contributing to
                    aid in the overthrow of their government. While these negotiations were going on
                    the work of plunder had already been commenced. Stores, shops,. and other places
                    of business were broken into and robbed of whatever of their contents yet
                    remained unremoved or unsecreted. In some cases saloons were opened and liquor
                    obtained and some of the soldiers became intoxicated. Citizens, too, along the
                    streets were relieved of hats, caps, boots, shoes, watches, etc.</p>
<p>As soon as General McCausland saw that the money demanded would not be furnished
                    he gave the order to commence the work of destruction. Detachments were sent to
                    different parts of the town. Houses were opened, furniture was broken and piled
                    upon heaps in rooms and fired. In some cases fire was kindled in closets,
                    bureaus, and other depositories of clothing. Many of the Confederate soldiers
                    entered into this work with evident delight, and to the entreaties and tears of
                    the aged, the infirm, of women and children, they turned a deaf ear. Others, to
                    their credit be it said, entirely disapproved of the work, and only entered upon
                    it because compelled to do so. In some instances, in response to the cries and
                    entreaties of the afflicted inmates of houses entered, the unwilling soldiers
                    would say: "I must obey my orders and fire your house; you can do what you
                    please when I leave." In some cases, after fire had been kindled, others would
                    come in and assist in extinguishing it. Some sections of the town were entirely
                    saved because (end of page 582) the officers sent there refused to execute their
                    barbarous orders, and in a few cases officers and soldiers worked with citizens
                    at the fire engine to extinguish the flames. Cases were numerous in which
                    valuable articles were taken from those who were dragging them from their
                    burning homes, or through streets and alleys, up upon the horses by their riders
                    and safely deposited upon the outskirts of the town. Others again were robbed of
                    valuable articles which they were trying to carry away. The writer, while
                    running with his family through flame and smoke, was pursued and stopped by a
                    Confederate cavalryman and ordered to hand over a satchel. When assured that it
                    contained neither money nor valuables, but a few pieces of clothing, the man
                    desisted and rode away. No sooner did this one leave us than another rode up and
                    entreated one of the ladies of our company to mount his horse and ride away,
                    declaring that he would never use him again in the Confederate service.</p>
<p>The scenes enacted in the streets during the earlier part of the burning were
                    distressing indeed. People were running wildly about in search of children and
                    friends. The occupants of houses were dragging from their threatened or burning
                    homes valuable articles, such as sewing machines, articles of furniture, etc.
                    Others with their arms full of clothing, bedding, carpets, books, pictures,
                    etc., were running hither and thither seeking places of safety. In some cases
                    these persons were compelled to sit down and pull off their boots and hand them
                    over to some cavalryman.</p>
<p>In a town the size of Chambersburg there were necessarily many aged, infirm, and
                    sick persons, as well as some dead bodies of friends awaiting burial. The infirm
                    had to be assisted to places of safety; the sick removed; and corpses
                    temporarily buried in gardens. In several instances Confederate soldiers
                    assisted in these humane acts. In a few cases houses isolated from others were
                    spared and guards placed about them, because one or more of the inmates were too
                    ill to be removed; and others still were spared by paying a ransom. Had the
                    destruction occurred in winter, or at night, or during a storm, the destruction
                    of life, with other imaginable horrors, would have been fearful. But it was in
                    the morning and during a perfect calm. And yet at one time a fearful cyclone, or
                    funnel-shaped column, which originated in the public square, where the
                    converging flames seemed to have suddenly given birth and shape to this terrible
                    apparition, moved with a hissing and roaring noise eastward along the line of
                    Market Street, carrying far up into the heavens innumerable flakes of fire,
                    ignited shingles and bits of boards. In its course it passed over the ground
                    surrounding a residence which was not burned, and in which clothing, bedding,
                    furniture, etc., had been deposited. As this whirling, hissing, and sucking cone
                    touched these articles, it instantly drew (end of page 583) some of the lighter
                    ones up into the air. Pillows, feather-beds, bed quilts, and other articles were
                    carried up and fell at considerable distances. A little girl of probably four
                    years of age was caught by the monster and lifted six or eight feet from the
                    ground.</p>
<p>The conflagration at its height was a scene of surpassing grandeur and terror. As
                    building after building was fired, or caught from others, column after column of
                    smoke rose black, straight, and single; first one, then another, and another.
                    Each of these then, like huge serpents, writhed and twisted into a thousand
                    fantastic shapes, until all finally blended and commingled, and formed one vast
                    and livid column of smoke and flame which rose perpendicularly to the sky, and
                    then spread out into a huge crown of sackcloth. It was heaven's shield
                    mercifully drawn over the scene to shelter from the blazing sun the homeless and
                    unsheltered ones that had fled to the fields and cemeteries around the town,
                    where they in silence and sadness sat and looked upon the destruction of their
                    homes and the accumulations of a life-time. Add to all this the roaring and
                    crackling of the flames, the sound of falling walls, the distressing cries of
                    burning animals, as horses, cattle, and swine, and a picture of the terrible is
                    seen which no one who witnessed it would ever desire to have repeated.</p>
<p>General McCausland crossed the Potomac at Cherry Run and McCoy's fords, thus
                    turning the right flank of General Averell, who had been placed nearly opposite
                    him to watch him. As a demonstration in his favor, and to prevent Averell from
                    intercepting him, the divisions of Rodes and Ramsuer and the cavalry brigade of
                    Vaughan also crossed the river at Williamsport - Vaughan pressing on as far as
                    Hagerstown, Maryland. Averell, thus threatened upon both flanks, was under the
                    necessity of looking after his own safety, and accordingly fell back into
                    Pennsylvania, reaching Greencastle, eleven miles south of Chambersburg, about
                    sundown, where he went into bivouac. Learning of his presence there, General
                    Couch, who yet remained at Chambersburg, sent him three successive dispatches
                    peremptorily ordering him on to the latter place. These dispatches were taken by
                    couriers to the camp, but Averell could not be found. For some reason which has
                    never been satisfactorily explained, he had changed the place of his own rest
                    without the knowledge of his staff and when Couch's orders were taken to the
                    camp no one knew where the General was.<b>* [See footnote at
                        bottom of document]</b> At length about four o'clock in the morning he
                    was found and the (end of page 584) dispatches placed in his hands, but it was
                    then too late. General Couch, unable to communicate with him, and having no
                    other force to rely upon, had left the town. Averell at once put his command in
                    motion, but still fearing an attack by Vaughan's command, which had pressed him
                    the day before, (end of page 585) and to avoid being caught between it and the
                    force under McCausland, he proceeded in an easterly direction until he reached
                    Greenwood, eight miles from Chambersburg, when he turned westward and proceeded
                    to the latter place. The Confederates, apprised by their scouts of his approach,
                    left the (end of page 586) burning town about eleven o'clock and passed rapidly
                    westward and crossed the North Mountain into Fulton County and thence down the
                    valley and recrossed the Potomac at Hancock, pursued by Averell. Had General
                    Averell informed his staff of his removal, Couch's dispatches would have reached
                    him in time, and the terrible disaster of Chambersburg would have been averted.
                    It certainly seems strange that a commander of Averell's sagacity should, under
                    the threatening circumstances, have committed so grave an oversight.</p>
<p>The work of destruction was commenced about eight o'clock in the morning, and by
                    eleven o'clock the enemy had all gone, but so thorough had been their work that
                    the major part of Chambersburg - its chief wealth and business, its capital and
                    elegance - were laid in ruins. Ten squares of buildings were burned and two
                    thousand human beings were made homeless, and many of them penniless. From this
                    disaster the majority never recovered, but lived the remainder of their days in
                    poverty. Reduced from affluence to poverty, many were dependent upon the charity
                    of the few whose homes escaped the invaders' torch, as well as upon the
                    provision made by the military authorities to meet their immediate wants.</p>
<p>When the fire had subsided and the enemy had gone, the people who had taken
                    refuge in the cemeteries and fields around the town, returned to view the
                    remains of their ruined homes. Sad indeed were their feelings when they stood by
                    the scene of desolation, recognizing here and there among the ruins some
                    articles which reminded them of the past, as broken and warped stoves, cooking
                    utensils, etc. But when night came on, and a place of shelter had to be sought,
                    then only did they realize their sad condition. Such buildings as had escaped
                    the common destruction were opened and were crowded to their utmost capacity.
                    Some made their way on foot to the country, or to neighboring towns, and some
                    removed to distant places, never again to reside in Chambersburg. Chambersburg
                    was founded A.D. 1764, and was burned A.D. 1864.</p>
<p>The following is the aggregate of the buildings burned: Residences and places of
                    business, 266; barns and stables, 98; out-buildings of various kinds, (end of
                    page 587) 173; total buildings burned, 537. Two commissions, composed of
                    competent and disinterested persons, appointed by the governor of the State, and
                    authorized by acts of the legislature, came to the town and adjudicated the
                    losses of the citizens by the fire. The claims adjudicated by these commissions
                    were carefully scrutinized. Each claimant was examined separately and under
                    oath, evidence besides his own being required. The claims thus adjudicated were
                    as follows: Real estate, $713,294.34; personal property, $915,137.24: total,
                    $1,628,431.58. Immediately after the fire the legislature of</p>
<p>[image, with the following caption: AFTER THE FIRE. This view, copied from a
                    photograph taken shortly after the fire, shows the ruins of the north-east
                    corner of the public square. The column on the left marks the ruins of the
                    writer's dwelling and store, and the ruins to the right are those of the Court
                    House. Between these two buildings stood Franklin Hall. These three buildings
                    were not in line in front, but the hall was about thirty feet behind the
                    writer's building, and the Court House about seventy-five feet behind the hall.
                    The walls of the hall had entirely fallen except the column on the extreme
                    right, which marks its south-west corner. Had these walls not fallen the ruins
                    of the Court House could not have been seen in this picture.]</p>
<p>the State was convened in special session, and after visiting the town and
                    ascertaining the destitution of the people, the sum of one hundred thousand
                    dollars was appropriated to meet the immediate wants of the needy. This (end of
                    page 588) sum was divided, not pro-rata to the amount of losses sustained, but
                    according to the necessities of each. Subsequently an appropriation of five
                    hundred thousand dollars, followed a year or two later by another of three
                    hundred thousand, was made. These appropriations were divided pro-rata, and, as
                    will be seen from the figures given, paid about one half the losses by the fire.
                    Certificates were given for the remainder, certifying to the amount, but not
                    binding the State to pay it until the United States indemnifies the State.</p>
<p>Three causes have been assigned for the destruction of Chambersburg. One of these
                    is that it was in revenge for the innocent hospitality the town gave to John
                    Brown and his misguided followers when planning their mad raid upon Harper's
                    Ferry. A second is, that it was in retaliation for alleged acts of burning and
                    destruction committed by Federal troops in the South, and specially in the
                    Shenandoah Valley, by orders of General Hunter during the raid referred to in
                    the opening of this article. A third opinion regards it as a barbarous, wanton,
                    and unjustifiable act. The true cause will appear in the following statements.
                    The first is a letter written by General Early, who gave the order, in response
                    to one addressed to him by the writer:</p>
<p>YELLOW SULPHUR SPRINGS, September 4th, 1884.</p>
<p>J. HOKE, ESQ:</p>
<p> - Having been from home since the 5th of August,
                    your letter of the 6th of that month did not reach me until a very few days ago,
                    when it was forwarded to me from Lynchburg with a number of others.</p>
<p>As you desire my statement in regard to the burning of Chambersburg,
                    Pennsylvania, under my order in July, 1864, I send you a copy of my "Memoirs of
                    the Last Year of the War," in which you will find, on pages 60 to 70, my account
                    of that affair. All I have to add, is that on my march from Lynchburg in pursuit
                    of General Hunter, and down the valley on the expedition against Washington, I
                    had seen the evidences of the destruction wantonly committed by his troops under
                    his orders, including the burning of a number of private houses without
                    provocation, among them being the family residence, at Lexington, of ex-Governor
                    Letcher; also the Virginia Military Institute at the same place, and a part of
                    the town of Newtown, in Frederick County; and in addition there had been a
                    wholesale destruction of private property, including even wearing apparel of
                    ladies, and bed clothing; the beds in many cases being cut to pieces and the
                    feathers scattered to the winds. In addition, there had been the destruction of
                    several towns in the South by Federal troops, among them being the town of
                    Darien, Georgia, in the year 1863. When, therefore, on my return from the
                    expedition threatening Washington, I found that Hunter, who had reached the
                    lower valley on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, after his flight to the Kanawha
                    Valley, had been engaged in his accustomed work and had burned the valuable
                    residences of several citizens of Jefferson County, I (end of page 589)
                    determined to demand compensation therefor from some town in Pennsylvania, and
                    in the event of failure to comply with my demand to retaliate by burning said
                    town. The town of Chambersburg was selected because it was the only one of any
                    consequence accessible to my troops, and . The houses mentioned with their contents, all of which were
                    destroyed, were fully worth at least $100,000 in gold, and I required $500,000
                    in United States currency in the alternative, for the reason that said currency
                    was rapidly depreciating, being then nearly three to one in gold, and I
                    determined to secure the full equivalent of $100,000 in gold. I will add that
                    according to the laws of retaliation in war, I would have been justified in
                    burning Chambersburg without giving the town a chance of redemption.</p>
<p>Compare the expedition of Hunter into Virginia in June, 1864, the campaign of
                    Sherman in Georgia and South Carolina, of Banks in the trans-Mississippi, and
                    Sheridan in the valley of Virginia, with General Lee in Pennsylvania, leaving
                    out of consideration Beast Butler's performances in New Orleans, and then say
                    whether the denunciations of those who applaud the destroyer of Atlanta,
                    Georgia, and Columbia, South Carolina, and him who boasted that, besides burning
                    the town of Dayton, he had so desolated the valley as that a crow flying over it
                    would have to carry its rations, should have any terror for me.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>J.A. EARLY.</p>
<p>Accompanying the foregoing letter was a pamphlet of one hundred and thirty-six
                    pages, entitled "A Memoir of the Last Year of the War for Independence in the
                    Confederate States of America, containing an account of the operations of his
                    commands in the years 1864 and 1865, by Lieutenant-General Jubal A. Early, of
                    the Provisional Army of the Confederate States." In a foot-note on page 70,
                    General Early, speaking of the destruction of Chambersburg, says: "For this act
                    I, alone, am responsible, as the officers engaged in it were simply executing my
                    orders, and had no discretion left them." As General Early, then, assumes the
                    entire responsibility in this matter, and claims as his justification the wanton
                    destruction of property by General Hunter in the Shenandoah Valley, it is but
                    fair to give him a further hearing, as well as to introduce other testimony to
                    the allegations he makes. I therefore quote from his pamphlet as follows:</p>
<p>"The scenes on Hunter's route from Lynchburg had been truly heart-rending. Houses
                    had been burned, and helpless women and children left without shelter. The
                    country had been stripped of provisions, and many families left without a morsel
                    to eat. Furniture and bedding had been cut to pieces, and old men and women and
                    children robbed of all the clothing they had except that on their backs. Ladies
                    trunks had been rifled and their dresses torn to pieces in mere wantonness. * *
                    We had renewed evidence of the outrages committed by Hunter's orders in burning
                    and plundering private houses. We saw the ruins of a number of houses to which
                    the torch had (end of page 590) been applied by his orders. At Lexington he had
                    burned the Military Institute, with all its scientific apparatus; and Washington
                    College had been plundered and the statue of Washington stolen. The residence of
                    ex-Governor Letcher at that place had been burned by his orders, and but a few
                    minutes given Mrs. Letcher and her family to leave the house." (Page 48.)</p>
<p>Again General Early, on page 50, says:</p>
<p>"On this day (July 2d) we passed through Newtown where several houses, including
                    that of a Methodist minister, had been burned by Hunter's orders, because a part
                    of Mosby's command had attacked a train of supplies for Sigel's force at this
                    place. The original order was to burn the whole town, but the officer sent to
                    execute it had revolted at the cruel mandate of his superior, and another had
                    been sent who had but partially executed it, after having forced the people to
                    take the oath of allegiance to the United States to save their houses. Mosby's
                    battalion, though called 'guerillas' by the enemy, was a regular organization in
                    the Confederate army, and was merely serving on detached duty under General
                    Lee's orders. The attack on the train was an act of legitimate warfare, and the
                    order to burn Newtown, and the burning of the houses mentioned, were most
                    wanton, cruel, unjustifiable, and cowardly."</p>
<p>One more quotation from this pamphlet is as follows:</p>
<p>"On the 26th (July) we moved to Martinsburg, the cavalry going to the Potomac.
                    The 27th and 28th were employed in destroying the railroad, it having been
                    repaired since we passed over it at the beginning of the month. While at
                    Martinsburg it was ascertained, beyond all doubt, that Hunter had been again
                    indulging in his favorite mode of warfare, and that, after his return to the
                    valley, while we were near Washington, among other outrages, the residences of
                    Mr. Andrew Hunter, a member of the Virginia Senate, Mr. Alexander R. Boteler, an
                    ex-member of the Confederate Congress, and Edmund I. Lee, with their contents,
                    had been burned by his orders, only time enough being given for the ladies to
                    get out of the houses. * * I now came to the conclusion that we had stood this
                    mode of warfare long enough, and that it was time to open the eyes of the people
                    of the North to its enormity by an example in the way of retaliation. I did not
                    select the cases mentioned as having more merit or greater claims for
                    retaliation than others, but because they had occurred within the limits of the
                    country covered by my command, and were brought more immediately to my
                    attention.</p>
<p>"The town of Chambersburg, in Pennsylvania, was selected as the one on which
                    retaliation should be made, and McCausland was ordered to proceed with his
                    brigade and that of Johnson's and a battery of artillery to that place, and
                    demand of the municipal authorities the sum of $100,000 in gold (end of page
                    591) or $500,000 in United States currency, as a compensation for the
                    destruction of the houses named and their contents; and, in default of payment,
                    to lay the town in ashes, in retaliation for the burning of these houses and
                    others in Virginia, as well as for the towns which had been burned in other
                    Southern States. A written demand to that effect was sent to the municipal
                    authorities, and they were informed what would be the result of a failure to
                    comply with it. I desired to give the people of Chambersburg an opportunity of
                    saving their town by making compensation for part of the injury done, and hoped
                    that the payment of such a sum would have the desired effect, and open the eyes
                    of the people of the North to the necessity of urging upon their government the
                    adoption of a different policy."</p>
<p>As General Early bases his retaliatory policy upon certain specific acts of
                    alleged vandalism upon the part of General Hunter, it is important that the
                    fullest information upon those facts that can be obtained should be considered
                    here. I will therefore introduce some extracts from an article written by
                    General J.D. Imboden, for the Philadelphia , and republished in Annals of the War (pages 169-183), entitled
                    "Fire, Sword, and the Halter." This article by General Imboden is lengthy and
                    enters into details, covering the precise cases referred to by Early, as well as
                    many others, to which the latter but incidentally refers. General Imboden says:</p>
<p>"Up to his occupation of Staunton, where his army was so much strengthened by
                    Crook and Averell, as to relieve his mind of all apprehension of disaster, the
                    conduct of General Hunter had been soldierly, striking his blows only at armed
                    men. But at Staunton he commenced burning private property, and, as will be seen
                    further on, the passion for house burning grew upon him, and a new system of
                    warfare was inaugurated that a few weeks afterward culminated in the retaliatory
                    burning of Chambersburg. * *</p>
<p>"From Brownsburg General Hunter proceeded to Lexington, encountering only such
                    delay as McCausland could effect with a single brigade of cavalry. At Lexington
                    he enlarged upon the operations begun at Staunton. On his way, and in the
                    surrounding country, he burnt mills, furnaces, store-houses, granaries, and all
                    farming utensils he could find, beside a great amount of fencing, and a large
                    quantity of grain. In the town he burnt the Virginia Military Institute, and all
                    the professor's houses except the superintendent's (General Smith), where he had
                    his head-quarters, and found a portion of the family too sick to be removed. He
                    had the combustibles collected to burn Washington College, the recipient of the
                    benefactions of the Father of his Country by his will; but yielding to the
                    appeals of the trustees and citizens, spared the building, but destroyed the
                    philosophical and chemical apparatus, libraries, and furniture. He burned the
                    mills and some private (end of page 592) stores in the lower part of the town.
                    Captain Towns, an officer in General Hunter's army, took supper with the family
                    of Governor John Letcher. Mrs. Letcher having heard threats that her house would
                    be burned, spoke of it to Captain Towns, who said it could not be possible, and
                    remarked that he would go at once to head-quarters and let her know. He went,
                    returned in a half hour, and told her that he was directed by General Hunter to
                    assure her that the house would not be destroyed, and she might, therefore, rest
                    easy. After this, she dismissed her fears, not believing it possible that a man
                    occupying Hunter's position would be guilty of wilful and deliberate falsehood
                    to a lady. It, however, turned out otherwise, for the next morning, at half past
                    eight o'clock, his assistant provost-marshal, accompanied by a portion of his
                    guard, rode up to the door, and Captain Berry dismounted, rang the door bell,
                    called for Mrs. Letcher, and informed her that General Hunter had ordered him to
                    burn her house. She replied: 'There must be some mistake,' and requested to see
                    the order. He said it was verbal. She asked if its execution could not be
                    delayed till she could see General Hunter? He replied: `The order is peremptory,
                    and you have five minutes to leave the house.' Mrs. Letcher then asked if she
                    could be allowed to remove her mother's, her sister's, her own, and her
                    children's clothing. This request being refused, she left the house. In a very
                    short time they poured camphene on the parlor floor and ignited it with a match.
                    In the meantime Miss Lizzie Letcher was trying to remove some articles of
                    clothing from the other end of the house, and Berry, finding these in her arms,
                    set fire to them. The wardrobe and bureaus were then fired, and soon the house
                    was enveloped in flames. Governor Letcher's mother, then seventy-eight years
                    old, lived on the adjoining lot. They fired her stable, within forty feet of the
                    dwelling, evidently to burn it, too; but owing to the active exertions of
                    Captain Towns, who made his men carry water, the house was saved. While Hunter
                    was in Lexington, Captain Matthew White, residing near town, was arrested, taken
                    about two miles, and, without trial, was shot, on the allegation that he was a
                    bush-whacker. During the first year of the war he commanded the Rockbridge
                    Cavalry, and was a young gentleman of generous impulses and good character. The
                    total destruction of private property in Rockbridge County, by Hunter, was
                    estimated and published in the local papers at the time as over $2,000,000. The
                    burning of the Institute was a public calamity, as it was an educational
                    establishment of great value.</p>
<p>"From Lexington he proceeded to Buchanan, in Botetourt County, and camped on the
                    magnificent estate of Colonel John T. Anderson, an elder brother of General
                    Joseph R. Anderson, of the Tredegar Iron Works, at Richmond. Colonel Anderson's
                    estate, on the banks of the Upper James, and his (end of page 593) mansion, were
                    baronial in character. The house crowned a high, wooded hill, was very large,
                    and furnished in a style to dispense that lavish hospitality which was the pride
                    of so many of the old-time Virginians. It was a seat of luxury and refinement,
                    and in all respects a place to make the owner contented with his lot in this
                    world. Colonel Anderson was old - his head as white as snow - and his wife but a
                    few years his junior. He was in no office, and too old to fight - hence he was
                    living on his fine estate strictly the life of a private gentleman. He had
                    often, in years gone by, filled prominent representative positions from his
                    county. There was no military or public object on God's earth to be gained by
                    ruining such a man. Yet Hunter, after destroying all that he could on the
                    plantation when he left it, ordered the grand old mansion, with all its
                    contents, to be laid in ashes." * * * *</p>
<p>General Imboden, then, details the burning of several fine mansions in the Lower
                    Valley, referred to also by General Early. He says:</p>
<p>"I shall conclude this already long narrative by citing a few more instances of
                    Hunter's incendiarism in the Lower Valley. It seems that, smarting under the
                    miserable failure of his grand raid on I,ynchburg, where, during a march of over
                    two hundred miles, the largest force he encountered was under Jones, at
                    Piedmont, and he routed that, thus leaving the way open to Lynchburg within
                    three days, destroy the stores there and go out through West Virginia
                    unmolested, he had failed to do any thing but inflict injury on private
                    citizens, and he came back to the Potomac more implacable than when he left it a
                    month before. His first victim was the Hon. Andrew Hunter, of Charlestown,
                    Jefferson County, his own first cousin, and named after the General's father.
                    Mr. Hunter was a lawyer of great eminence, and a man of deservedly large
                    influence in his county and the state. His home, eight miles from Harper's
                    Ferry, in the suburbs of Charlestown, was the most costly and elegant in the
                    place, and his family as refined and cultivated as any in the state. His
                    offense, is General Hunter's eyes, was that he had gone politically with his
                    state, and was in full sympathy with the Confederate cause. The general sent a
                    squadron of cavalry out from Harper's Ferry, took Mr. Hunter prisoner, and held
                    him a month in the common guard house of his soldiers, without alleging any
                    offense against him not common to nearly all the people of Virginia, and finally
                    discharged him without trial or explanation, after heaping these indignities
                    upon him. Mr. Hunter was an old man, and suffered severely from confinement and
                    exposure. While he was thus a prisoner, General Hunter ordered his elegant
                    mansion to be burned to the ground, with all its contents, not even permitting
                    Mrs. Hunter and her daughter to save their clothes and family pictures from the
                    flames; and, to add to the desolation, camped his cavalry within the inclosure
                    of the beautiful (end of page 594) grounds, of several acres, surrounding the
                    residence, till the horses had destroyed them.</p>
<p>"General Hunter's next exploit was at Shepherdstown, in the same county, where,
                    on the 19th of July, 1864, he caused to be burned the residence of Hon. A.R.
                    Boteler, 'Fountain Rock.' Mrs. Boteler was a cousin of General Hunter. This
                    homestead was an old colonial house endeared to the family by a thousand tender
                    memories, and contained a splendid library, many pictures, and an invaluable
                    collection of rare and precious manuscripts, illustrating the early history of
                    that part of Virginia, that Colonel Boteler had collected by years of toil. The
                    only members of the family who were there at the time were Colonel Boteler's
                    eldest and widowed daughter, Mrs. Shepherd, who was an invalid, her three
                    children, the eldest five years old and the youngest eighteen months, and Miss
                    Helen Boteler. Colonel Boteler and his son were in the army, and Mrs. Boteler in
                    Baltimore. The ladies and children were at dinner when informed by the servants
                    that a body of cavalry had turned in at the gate, from the turnpike, and were
                    coming up to the house."</p>
<p>General Imboden then proceeds to detail the manner of the burning of this house
                    by order of General Hunter, and follows this description with another detailing
                    the burning of the residence of Mr. Edmund I. Lee, in the same locality. He then
                    concludes as follows:</p>
<p>"If the people of Chambersburg will carefully read this record of wanton
                    destruction of private property, this 'o'er true tale' of cruel wrong inflicted
                    on the helpless, they will understand why, when goaded to madness, remuneration
                    was demanded at their hands by General Early, and upon its refusal retaliation
                    was inflicted on the nearest community that could be reached, and it was their
                    misfortune to be that community. Contrast Lee in Pennsylvania, in 1863, and
                    Hunter in Virginia, in 1864, and judge them both as history will."</p>
<p>I follow these accounts by Generals Early and Imboden with an extract from a
                    letter from F.C. Slingluff, Esq., a leading member of the bar of the city of
                    Baltimore, and a gentleman of unimpeachable veracity. Mr. Slingluff was a member
                    of the First Maryland (Confederate) Cavalry, General Bradley T. Johnson's
                    brigade. He participated in the valley campaign, and was an eye-witness of what
                    he relates. He was also present, as a private, in the destruction of
                    Chambersburg. Mr. Slingluff says:</p>
<p>" * * Now you would like to know if the men whom I have described (the men who
                    assisted in burning Chambersburg, many of whom are now among the leading
                    merchants, lawyers, doctors, and farmers of Baltimore and other parts of
                    Maryland,) justified the burning of your town, in their individual capacity,
                    irrespective of the orders from head-quarters, under (end of page 595) which
                    they acted. I must say to you frankly that they did, and I never heard one
                    dissenting voice. And why did we justify so hard a measure? Simply because we
                    had long come to the conclusion that it was time for us to burn something in the
                    enemy's country. For the campaign of the preceding year, when our whole army had
                    passed through your richest section of country, where the peaceful homes and
                    fruitful fields only made the contrast with what we had left the more
                    significant, many a man, whose home was in ruins, chafed under the orders from
                    General Lee, which forbade him to touch them, but the orders were obeyed and we
                    left the homes and fields as we found them, the ordinary wear and tear of an
                    army of occupation alone excepted. We had so often before our eyes the reverse
                    of this wherever your army swept through Virginia, that we were thoroughly
                    convinced of the justice of a stern retaliation.</p>
<p>"It is no pleasure to me to have to recall the scenes of those days, nor do I do
                    so in any spirit of vindictiveness, but I simply tell the truth in justification
                    of an act which you and others may suppose was without justification. We had
                    followed Kilpatrick (I think it was) in his raid through Madison, Greene, and
                    other counties, and had seen the cattle shot, or ham-strung in the barn-yards,
                    the agricultural implements burned, the feather-beds and clothing of the women
                    and children cut in shreds in mere wantonness, farm-house after farm-house
                    stripped of every particle of provisions, private carriages cut and broken up,
                    and women in tears lamenting all this. I do not write here anything that I did
                    not see myself. We had seen a thousand ruined homes in Clark, Jefferson, and
                    Frederick counties, - barns and houses burned and private property destroyed, -
                    but we had no knowledge that this was done by 'official orders.' At last when
                    the official order came openly from General Hunter, and the burning was done
                    there under his orders, and when our orders of retaliation came, they met with
                    the approbation, as I have said, of every man who crossed the Potomac to execute
                    them. Of course we had nothing personal against your pretty little town. It just
                    so happened that it was the nearest and most accessible place of importance for
                    us to get to. It was the unfortunate victim of circumstances. Had it been
                    further off and some other town nearer, that other town would have gone, and
                    Chambersburg would have been saved."</p>
<p>These three persons whose statements have been given, while speaking of the
                    general disregard of private property in the South, concur in the allegation of
                    General Hunter's wholesale destructive propensities, and two of them
                    specifically refer to the destruction of the properties of Andrew Hunter, A.R.
                    Boteler, E.I. Lee, ex-Governor Letcher, J.T. Anderson, and the Virginia Military
                    Institute. These six properties were specifically named by (end of page 596)
                    General Early in his order to McCausland, and upon these he based his
                    retributive demand, upon Chambersburg. The responsibility, then, for the
                    destruction of Chambersburg, it will be seen, rests upon General Hunter. Justice
                    to him, and to the people of the South, as well as the truth of history, demands
                    a fair, candid, and impartial consideration of the case.</p>
<p>The fact of the destruction of the six properties named, as well as many others
                    by General Hunter, in his valley campaign, has not been denied. Federal
                    soldiers, who saw these ruins, have freely admitted them. But while these facts
                    are conceded, General Hunter claims that he had sufficient ground for his
                    severity in the following considerations: In no part of the South, perhaps, was
                    the hostility to the Union so bitter and malignant as in the valley of Virginia.
                    With but few exceptions the entire male population, capable of bearing arms,
                    were either in the Confederate army, or the secret emissaries of such as were
                    thus engaged. The entire valley was infested with guerillas and bush-whackers
                    who, during the day, assumed to be farmers and tradesmen, and at night carried
                    on the nefarious work of waylaying straggling Federal soldiers and unprotected
                    trains. Familiar with every foot of ground in the valley, as well as with the
                    mountain fastnesses, they stole upon their victims, and then, under the cover of
                    the night, fled to places of safety. And as one of the evidences of the facts
                    stated, the following account of an act of barbarity, committed by this class of
                    men, is cited. It was published in one of the papers of Martinsburg, West
                    Virginia, July 23, 1864, under the caption of "A Fiendish Act." "Six Union
                    soldiers were found strapped to a fence in the vicinity of Charlestown, having
                    their throats cut from ear to ear. The fiendish act is supposed to have been the
                    work of resident Confederates, who are farmers and tradesmen during the day and
                    guerillas at night. Virginia swarms with men of this class, who have, ever since
                    the commencement of the war, pursued a course of this kind, and who have
                    committed deeds so fiendish in their character as to put to blush the darkest
                    and bloodiest deeds of our Indian savages. It is said that General Hunter is as
                    mad as -- about this barbarous deed, and has arrested some sixty residents of
                    the neighborhood in which these unfortunate men were found, and are now held in
                    order, if possible, to ferret out the guilty parties and bring them to justice."</p>
<p>Compare the date of the foregoing barbarous act with the arrest and imprisonment
                    of Mr. Andrew Hunter, and the destruction of the properties referred to in that
                    neighborhood, and the cause which led General Hunter to adopt so severe a
                    retributive policy will be seen. In justification of the destruction of the
                    property of ex-Governor Letcher, it is said, whether truly or falsely I can not
                    say, that the form of a hand-bill was found in a printing (end of page 597)
                    establishment in Lexington, bearing Letcher's name, and urging the bushwhacking
                    of Federal soldiers; and, further, that his house was occupied by concealed
                    sharpshooters, who fired upon some of General Hunter's men. What the particular
                    provocation was, which led to the destruction of the other properties named, has
                    not been stated.The three gentlemen from whom I have quoted - Early, Imboden,
                    and Slingluff, - refer to the humane manner in which General Lee conducted his
                    campaign in Pennsylvania in 1863, and claim that no wanton destruction of
                    private property was made. This is freely admitted. With the exception of the
                    railroad buildings in Chambersburg, and one or two buildings on the field of
                    Gettysburg, no houses or barns were destroyed. Private property was taken for
                    the use of the army, but, except in a few cases by stragglers, the regulations
                    of siezure [sic] laid down by General Lee in general orders No. 72, and issued
                    specially for the Pennsylvania campaign, were strictly observed. But while the
                    comparative good conduct of the Confederates in Pennsylvania is admitted, it
                    must also be remembered that there was no bushwhacking of them, nor depredations
                    committed upon their trains. Suppose General Lee had found a number of his men
                    massacred by citizens as were the six Federal soldiers near Charlestown,
                    Virginia, and the houses of the people used for concealed sharp-shooters, and
                    his trains waylaid and robbed, would he not have adopted a different policy, and
                    would not the laws of civilized warfare and the sentiment of the world have
                    justified him in so doing? That a retributive policy would have been adopted,
                    and severe retaliation visited upon the people, is clear from a paragraph in
                    General Order, No. 49, issued by Lieutenant-General Ewell while in Chambersburg:
                    "Citizens of the country through which the army may pass, who are not in the
                    military service, are admonished to abstain from all acts of hostility, ." The contrast, then, is not between the conduct of General Lee in
                    Pennsylvania, and his treatment of the people there, and that of General Hunter
                    in the Valley of Virginia and his treatment of the people in that locality, but
                    between the conduct of the people of Pennsylvania, and their treatment of the
                    Confederate army, and that of the people of the valley and their treatment of
                    the Federals.</p>
<p>The policy of the commanders of the Federal armies operating in the Shenandoah
                    Valley had been humane and lenient, notwithstanding the evils complained of, but
                    when General Hunter succeeded to the command in that place, he adopted a
                    different policy. From the time he assumed command in that department he gave
                    evidence that he had decided convictions as to how to deal with such inveterate
                    haters of the Union. He was convinced that the mild and lenient course pursued
                    by his predecessors had only em- (end of page 598) boldened them in their
                    unwarranted methods, and he determined to adopt a retaliatory policy. Guerrillas
                    and bushwhackers, whose depredations had heretofore gone unpunished, were now
                    notified that their claim to be in the regular Confederate service, under which
                    they claimed exemption from the summary punishment inflicted upon irregular and
                    unorganized soldiers, would no longer avail them. He accordingly issued and
                    circulated the following circular:</p>
<p>HEAD-QUARTERS OF WEST VIRGINIA, - IN THE FIELD.<br>Valley of the Shenandoah, May
                    24th, 1864.</p>
<p> - Your name has been reported to me with evidence
                    that you are one of the leading secessionist sympathizers in the valley, and
                    that you countenance and abet the bush-whackers and guerillas who infest the
                    woods and mountains of this region, swooping out on the roads to plunder and
                    outrage loyal residents, falling upon them and firing into defenseless
                    wagon-trains and assassinating soldiers of this command, who may chance to be
                    placed in exposed positions. These practices are not recognized by the laws of
                    war of any civilized nation, nor are the persons engaged therein entitled to any
                    other treatment than that done by the universal code of justice to pirates,
                    murderers, and other outlaws.</p>
<p>But from the difficulties of the country, the secret aid and information given to
                    these bush-whackers by persons of your class, and the more important occupation
                    of the troops under my command, it is impossible to chase, arrest, and punish
                    these marauders as they deserve. Without the countenance and help given to them
                    by the Confederate residents of the valley, they could not support themselves
                    for a week. You are spies upon our movements, abusing the clemency which has
                    protected your persons and property, while loyal citizens of the United States,
                    residing within the Confederate lines, are invariably plundered of all they may
                    possess, imprisoned, and in some cases put to death. It is from you and your
                    families and neighbors, that these bandits receive food, clothing, ammunition
                    and information, and it is from their secret hiding-places in your houses, barns
                    and woods, that they issue on their missions of pillage and murder.</p>
<p>You are therefore hereby notified, that for every train fired upon, or soldier of
                    the Union wounded or assassinated by bush-whackers in any neighborhood within
                    the reach of my command, the houses and other property of every secession
                    sympathizer residing within a circuit of five miles from the place of the
                    outrage, shall be destroyed by fire, and that for all public property jayhawked
                    or destroyed by these marauders, an assessment of five times the valve of such
                    property will be made upon the secession sympathizers residing within the
                    circuit of ten miles around the point at which the offense was committed. The
                    payment of this assessment will be enforced by the troops of this department,
                    who will sieze [sic] and hold in close military custody the persons assessed,
                    until such payment shall have been made. This provision will also be applied to
                    make good from the secessionists in the neighborhood five times the amount of
                    any loss suffered by loyal citizens of the United States, from the action of the
                    bush-whackers whom you may encourage.</p>
<p>If you desire to avoid the consequences herein set forth, you will notify your
                    (end of page 599) guerilla and bush-whacking friends to withdraw from that
                    portion of the valley within my lines, and to join, if they desire to fight for
                    the rebellion, the regular forces of the secession army in my front or
                    elsewhere. You will have none but yourselves to blame for the consequences that
                    will certainly ensue if these evils are permitted to continue. This circular is
                    not sent to you for the reason that you have been singled out as peculiarly
                    obnoxious, but because you are believed to furnish the readiest means of
                    communication with the prominent secession sympathizers of your neighborhood. It
                    will be for their benefit that you communicate to them the tenor of this
                    circular.</p>
<p>D. HUNTER,<br></p>
<p>In his invasion of Pennsylvania, General Lee fully appropriated to the use of his
                    army the resources of our people, conveying away with him all he had
                    transportation for. All was, however, taken under special instructions and by
                    specified officers, and either paid for in such money as he had, or vouchers
                    given. In the valley campaigns, Hunter and Sheridan did what Lee did in
                    Pennsylvania, except paying for what they took, and in addition destroyed, what
                    they could not consume or carry away. This was done as a war measure to deplete
                    the resources of the enemy. The Valley of Virginia had been the great store
                    house from which supplies had been drawn for the army about Richmond, and it was
                    deemed necessary to destroy these resources. Consequently all the grain,
                    provender, and cattle that could not be used were destroyed, and barns,
                    granaries, mills, and factories burned. It was an extreme measure allowable
                    under the circumstances. The policy, however, inaugurated by Hunter, as
                    indicated in the foregoing circular, was still a sterner resort, and could never
                    be justified unless the provocations were actually such as he states. If
                    citizens - persons not regularly in the Confederate service, and wearing the
                    Confederate uniform - committed depredations upon his trains and brutally
                    waylaid and murdered his soldiers, he was justified in resorting to the extreme
                    measure of retaliating upon the citizens and their property, and he was as
                    clearly within the rules of civilized warfare in so doing as was Lee in his more
                    humane policy in Pennsylvania. The fault lies with the people who first violated
                    the rules of war by depredations upon the soldiers. The severe punishment which
                    followed was but the sequel of their own actions. Chambersburg, then, was
                    burned, not so much because of General Hunter's retaliatory policy in the Valley
                    of Virginia, but because of the barbarous violations of the laws of war by the
                    citizens of the last named place.</p>
<p>War is a game at which the two contending parties can play, and any retaliatory
                    or cruel policy inaugurated by the one is invariably followed by a similar
                    policy by the other. It need not seem strange, then, that the first opportunity
                    the Confederates had of retaliating upon their enemies, they improved. They
                    could scarcely have been expected to do otherwise.</p>
<p>
                    <b>* [Footnote, pages 584-587]</b>
                </p>
<p>In so important a matter as this, in which a general officer of such well known
                    vigilance and efficiency as General Averell, is charged with indiscretion, or
                    negligence, resulting so disastrously as in this case, I have sought for the
                    most positive information, and append here extracts from letters from two
                    reliable persons whose means of information will not be questioned. The first is
                    from Thomas R. Bard, Esq., an at- [end of page 584] torney at the bar of
                    Hueneme, Ventura County, California. Mr. Bard was formerly a citizen of
                    Chambersburg, but at the time of the war was in the forwarding and commission
                    business, at Hagerstown, Maryland, and also the agent at that place of the
                    Cumberland Valley Railroad Company, charged with the duty of superintending the
                    transportation of troops and supplies. Mr. Bard, after detailing his departure
                    from Hagerstown upon the approach of the Confederates in the evening of Friday,
                    July 29th, and his attendance upon the telegraph office at Greencastle, and the
                    passage through that place of Averell's forces, says:</p>
<p>"General Averell left three 'orderlies' at the telegraph office to convey to him
                    all messages that might be received for him, and encamped his troops in a grove
                    distant about one and a half miles north-east of Greencastle, and only nine and
                    a half miles from Chambersburg. Late in the evening General Couch, commanding
                    the Department of the Susquehanna, with head-quarters at Chambersburg, sent a
                    message to General Averell, which was promptly handed to one of the orderlies,
                    who quickly mounted his horse and rode off in the direction of General Averell's
                    camp. Mr. B. Gilmore, the telegraph operator at Chambersburg, kept us informed
                    constantly of all that was transpiring at that place, and of the movements of
                    the Confederate force. It is quite probable that I was informed by one of the
                    operators as to the contents of the message from General Couch. At any rate, at
                    the time, I understood that General Couch informed General Averell that the
                    Confederate forces were at or had passed through Mercersburg, Pennsylvania, and
                    were moving toward Chambersburg; and, that being without adequate forces to
                    check the movement, he inquired whether Averell could be depended on for
                    assistance. Later in the night two other messages were received from General
                    Couch for General Averell, and were promptly delivered to the orderlies. The
                    last of these messages was received probably about three o'clock in the morning
                    of July 30th. These messages reported the rapid approach of the Confederates,
                    and expressed great anxiety to learn if General Averell intended to render
                    assistance for the defense of Chambersburg.</p>
<p>"There had been no reply from General Averell, and learning that General Couch
                    had made preparations for leaving Chambersburg, and that in all probability the
                    communications with that place would soon be interrupted, I mounted a horse and
                    hurriedly rode out to find General Averell. On the road, about half way to the
                    camp, I met the orderlies riding leisurely toward Greencastle. In reply to my
                    inquiry if they had delivered their messages, they said that General Averell
                    could not be found, and that they did not know what to do with the messages.
                    Hastily informing them of the importance of the dispatches, I took them in my
                    own hands, and telling them to follow me, I spurred my horse and was soon at the
                    grove. There was no sentry or guard to halt me. All was quiet. There was not a
                    sound save the champing of the feeding horses; there were no lights or fires
                    except the embers where the men had prepared their evening meal. I dashed into
                    the middle of the encampment, and there found a solitary man to answer my
                    inquiry, 'Where is General Averell?' He could not tell me. An officer of a West
                    Virginia regiment then appeared and said it would be difficult to find General
                    Averell, but offered to aid me in the search. While he prepared to mount his
                    horse, the booming of a cannon was heard in the direction of Chambersburg. The
                    (end of page 585) officer expressed surprise and asked, 'What can that be?' I
                    told him it supplemented the messages which I brought, and indicated that
                    McCausland had arrived at Chambersburg. We rode hastily through the grove and
                    soon found General Averell asleep by the side of a fence. On being awakened, he
                    raised upon his elbow and heard the information I had brought. I had handed him
                    the telegrams, but as there was no light I told him what they contained, and
                    informed him that they had been delivered to his orderlies hours before. He made
                    no reply, and, as I thought, was about to turn over and go to sleep. Minutes
                    seemed hours to me, and growing impatient I said to him, 'General Averell, if
                    you wish me to convey any answer to General Couch, I beg you to let me have it
                    quickly, for it is barely possible that I can get back before telegraphic
                    communications will be cut off.' Without rising to put his troops in motion, or
                    without the slightest manifestation of interest in the condition of General
                    Couch, or of the peril to which the loyal people of Chambersburg were exposed,
                    he merely said, 'Tell Couch I will be there in the morning.' It was then, I
                    think, about four o'clock, A.M. Returning to Greencastle, I found that already
                    the Chambersburg office was closed, having first reported that General Couch had
                    all his military forces and supplies on the cars, and that the Confederate
                    advance was about to enter the town."</p>
<p>The other account is from H.R. Fetterhoff, M.D, of Baltimore, Maryland, but at
                    the time of the war telegraph operator at Greencastle, Pennsylvania. Dr.
                    Fetterhof says:</p>
<p>"At the time these events transpired I was telegraph operator at Greencastle, and
                    had the means of knowing what was going on generally. In the evening of Friday,
                    July 29th, 1864, about eight o'clock, General Averell's command passed through
                    Greencastle on their way from Hagerstown toward Chambersburg, and bivouacked for
                    the night a short distance north of the town along the road leading to
                    Chambersburg. If my memory serves me right General Averell reported his arrival
                    to General Couch at Chambersburg. At least I so reported it to Mr. Gilmore,
                    telegraph operator at Chambersburg. The General sent three or four orderlies to
                    my office and informed me of his whereabouts. Mr. D.C. Aughinbaugh, operator at
                    Hagerstown, Mr. T.R. Bard, and I think several other persons from that place,
                    were at the office in the evening and at intervals during the night. The scouts
                    reported that the Confederates had built camp-fires in the neighborhood of State
                    Line, four miles south of Greencastle, and it was supposed that they had
                    encamped there for the night. About midnight, or perhaps a little later, Mr.
                    Gilmore informed me that the telegraph lines west of Chambersburg on the
                    Pittsburg turnpike had been cut, showing that the enemy after building the
                    camp-fires at the State Line as a blind had moved in the direction of Upton and
                    Bridgeport on General Averell's left flank. I immediately informed General
                    Averell of this fact, when he sent me a message thanking me for the information,
                    and requesting me to keep him posted in regard to any information I might
                    obtain. About one o'clock A.M. July 30th, General Couch sent an order to General
                    Averell directing him to 'Move on to Chambersburg at once.' I immediately sent
                    this message with an orderly, but never heard from him again. In about a half
                    hour General Couch repeated the message in the same words, and I sent another
                    orderly with the message, but still no answer. The same order was repeated about
                    every half (end of page 586) hour until my orderlies were all gone and I had no
                    one to carry the last message, when Mr. Bard came to my office and volunteered
                    to deliver it. After searching for General Averell and finding him he delivered
                    the message. I then learned that when I had sent General Averell the information
                    that the Confederates were in his rear, or on his flank, he moved his
                    head-quarters from the rear of his line, where it had been, up into the line
                    without informing the orderlies or any one else, consequently no one knew where
                    to find him, and the messages had not been delivered and only reached him near
                    four o'clock A.M. when Mr. Bard delivered them. The Confederates entered
                    Chambersburg about this time, and Mr. Gilmore bade me 'good-bye' and left the
                    office."</p>
