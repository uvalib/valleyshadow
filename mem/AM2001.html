                            Brigadier-General, C.S.A., 1887</h3>
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> General John D. Imboden recollects Thomas, later nick-named Stonewall, Jackson's
                    involvement in John Brown's Raid on Harper's Ferry. The article, published in
                    Volume I of Battles and Leaders of the Civil War,
                    details Jackon's interactions with the Staunton Artillery, General Imboden, and
                    other Augusta men, including John A. Harman.</p>
<p>THE movement to capture Harper's Ferry, Virginia, and the fire-arms manufactured
                    and stored there was organized at the Exchange Hotel in Richmond on the night of
                    April 16th, 1861. Ex-Governor Henry A. Wise was at the head of this purely
                    impromptu affair. The Virginia Secession Convention, then sitting, was by a
                    large majority "Union" in its sentiment till Sumter was fired on and captured,
                    and Mr. Lincoln called for seventy-five thousand men to enforce the laws in
                    certain Southern States. Virginia was then, as it were, forced to "take sides,"
                    and she did not hesitate. I had been one of the candidates for a seat in that
                    convention from Augusta county, but had been overwhelmingly defeated by the
                    "Union" candidates, because I favored secession as the only "peace measure"
                    Virginia could then adopt, our aim being to put the State in an independent
                    position to negotiate between the United States and the seceded Gulf and Cotton
                    States for a new Union, to be formed on a compromise of the slavery question by
                    a convention to be held for that purpose.</p>
<p>Late on April 15th I received a telegram from "Nat" Tyler, the editor of the
                    "Richmond Enquirer," summoning me to Richmond, where I arrived the next day.
                    Before reaching the Exchange Hotel I met ex-Governor Wise on the street. He
                    asked me to find as many officers of the armed and equipped volunteers of the
                    inland towns and counties as I could, and request them to be at the hotel by 7
                    in the evening to confer about a military movement which he deemed important.
                    Not many such officers were in town, but I found Captains Turner Ashby and
                    Richard Ashby of Fauquier county, Oliver R. Funsten of Clarke county, all
                    commanders of volunteer companies of cavalry; also Captain John A. Harman of
                    Staunton -- my home -- and Alfred M. Barbour, the latter ex-civil superintendent
                    of the Government works at Harper's Ferry. These persons, with myself, promptly
                    joined ex-Governor Wise, and a plan  for the capture of Harper's
                    Ferry was at once discussed and settled upon. The movement, it was agreed,
                    should commence the next day, the 17th, as soon as the convention voted to
                    secede, -- provided we could get railway transportation and the concurrence of
                    Governor Letcher. Colonel Edmund Fontaine, president of the Orange and
                    Alexandria and Manassas Gap railroads, were sent for, and joined us at the hotel
                    near midnight. They agreed to put the necessary trains in readiness next day to
                    obey any request of Governor Letcher for the movement of troops.</p>
<p>A committee, of which I was chairman, waited on Governor Letcher after midnight,
                    and, arousing him from his bed, laid the scheme before him. He stated that he
                    would take no step till officially informed that the ordinance of secession was
                    passed by the convention. He was then asked if contingent upon the event he
                    would next day order the movement by telegraph. He consented. We then informed
                    him what companies would be under arms ready to move at a moment's notice. All
                    the persons I have named above are now dead, except John S. Barbour, "Nat"
                    Tyler, and myself.</p>
<p>On returning to the hotel and reporting Governor Letcher's promise, it was
                    decided to telegraph the captains of the companies along the railroads mentioned
                    to be ready next day for orders from the governor. In that way I ordered the
                    Staunton Artillery, which I commanded, to assemble at their armory by 4 P. M. on
                    the 17th, to receive orders from the governor to aid in the capture of the
                    Portsmouth Navy Yard. This destination had been indicated in all our dispatches,
                    to deceive the Government at Washington in case there should be a "leak" in the
                    telegraph offices. Early in the evening a message had been received by
                    ex-Governor Wise from his son-in-law Doctor Gannett of Washington, to the effect
                    that a Massachusetts regiment, one thousand strong, had, been ordered to
                    Harper's Ferry. Without this reenforcement we knew the guard there consisted of
                    only forty-five men, who could be captured or driven away, perhaps without
                    firing a shot, if we could reach the place secretly.</p>
<p>The Ashbys, Funsten, Harman, and I remained up the entire night. The
                    superintendent and commandant of the Virginia Armory at Richmond, Captain
                    Charles Dimmock, a Northern man by birth and a West Point graduate, was in full
                    sympathy with us, and that night filled our requisitions for ammunition and
                    moved it to the railway station before sunrise. He also granted one hundred
                    stand of aims for the Martinsburg Light Infantry, a  new company
                    just formed. All these I receipted for and saw placed on the train. Just before
                    we moved out of the depot, Alfred Barbour made an unguarded remark in the car,
                    which was overheard by a Northern traveler, who immediately wrote a message to
                    President Lincoln and paid a negro a dollar to take it to the telegraph office.
                    This act was discovered by one of our party, who induced a friend to follow the
                    negro and take the dispatch from him. This perhaps prevented troops being sent
                    to head us off.</p>
<p>My telegram to the Staunton Artillery produced wild excitement, and spread
                    rapidly through the county, and brought thousands of people to Staunton during
                    the day. Augusta had been a strong Union county, and a doubt was raised by some
                    whether I was acting under the orders of Governor Letcher.  To
                    satisfy them, my brother, George W. Imboden, sent a message to me at
                    Gordonsville, inquiring under whose authority I had acted. On the arrival of the
                    train at Gordonsville, Captain Harman received the message and replied to it in
                    my name, that I was acting by order of the governor. Harman had been of the
                    committee, the night before, that waited on Governor Letcher, and he assumed
                    that by that hour -- noon -- the convention must have voted the State out of the
                    Union, and that the governor had kept his promise to send orders by wire. Before
                    we reached Staunton, Harman handed me the dispatch and told me what he had done.
                    I was annoyed by his action till the train drew up at Staunton, where thousands
                    of people were assembled, and my artillery company and the West Augusta Guards
                    (the finest infantry company in the valley) were in line. Major-General Kenton
                    Harper, a native of Pennsylvania, " a born soldier," and Brigadier-General
                    William H. Harman, both holding commissions in the Virginia militia, -- and both
                    of whom had won their spurs in the regiment the State had sent to the Mexican
                    war, -- met me as I alighted, with a telegram from Governor Letcher ordering
                    them into service, and referring them to me for information as to our
                    destination and troops. Until I imparted to them confidentially what had
                    occurred the night before, they thought, as did all the people assembled, that
                    we were bound for the Portsmouth Navy Yard. For prudential reasons, we said
                    nothing to dispel this illusion. The governor in his dispatch informed General
                    Harper that he was to take chief command, and that full written instructions
                    would reach him en route. He waited till after dark, and then set out for
                    Winchester behind a good team. Brigadier General Harman was ordered to take
                    command of the trains and of all troops that might report en route.</p>
<p>About sunset we took train; our departure was an exciting and affecting scene. At
                    Charlottesville, in the night, the Monticello Guards, Captain W. B. Mallory, and
                    the Albemarle Rifles, under Captain R. T. W. Duke, came aboard. At Culpeper a
                    rifle company joined us, and just as the sun rose on the 18th we reached
                    Manassas.</p>
<p>The Ashbys and Funsten had gone on the day before to collect their 
                    cavalry companies, and also the famous "Black Horse Cavalry," a superb body of
                    men and horses, under Captains John Scott and Welby Carter of Fauquier. By
                    marching across the Blue Ridge, they were to rendezvous near Harper's Ferry.
                    Ashby had sent men on the night of the 17th to cut the wires between Manassas
                    Junction and Alexandria, and to keep them cut for several days.</p>
<p>Our advent at the Junction astounded the quiet people of the village. General
                    Harman at once "impressed" the Manassas Gap train to take the lead, and switched
                    two or three other trains to that line in order to proceed to Strasburg. I was
                    put in command of the foremost train. We had not gone five miles when I
                    discovered that the engineer could not be trusted. He let his fire go down, and
                    came to a dead standstill on a slight ascending grade. A cocked pistol induced
                    him to fire up and go ahead. From there to Strasburg I rode in the engine-cab,
                    and we made full forty miles an hour with the aid of good dry wood and a navy
                    revolver.</p>
<p>At Strasburg we left the cars, and before 10 o'clock the infantry companies took
                    up the line of march for Winchester. I now had to procure horses for my guns.
                    The farmers were in their corn-fields, and some of them agreed to hire us horses
                    as far as Winchester, eighteen miles, while others refused. The situation being
                    urgent, we took the horses by force, under threats of being indicted by the next
                    grand jury of the county. By noon we had a sufficient number of teams. We
                    followed the infantry down the Valley Turnpike, reaching Winchester just at
                    nightfall. The people generally received us very coldly. The war spirit that
                    bore them up through four years of trial and privation had not yet been aroused.</p>
<p>General Harper was at Winchester, and had sent forward his infantry by rail to
                    Charlestown, eight miles from Harper's Ferry. In a short time a train returned
                    for my battery. The farmers got their horses and went home rejoicing, and we set
                    out for our destination. The infantry moved out of Charlestown about midnight.
                    We kept to our train as far as Halltown, only four miles from the ferry. There
                    we set down our guns to be run forward by hand to Bolivar Heights, west of the
                    town, from which we could shell the place if necessary.</p>

<p>A little before dawn of the next day, April 18th, a brilliant light
                    arose from near the point of confluence of the Shenandoah and Potomac rivers.
                    General Harper, who up to that moment had expected a conflict with the
                    Massachusetts regiment supposed to be at Harper's Ferry, was making his
                    dispositions for an attack at daybreak, when this light convinced him that the
                    enemy had fired the arsenal and fled. He marched in and took possession, but too
                    late to extinguish the flames. Nearly twenty thousand rifles and pistols were
                    destroyed. The workshops had not been fired. The people of the town told us the
                    catastrophe, for such it was to us, was owing to declarations made the day
                    before by the ex-superintendent, Alfred Barbour. He reached Harper's Ferry, via
                    Washington, on the 17th about noon, and, collecting the mechanics in groups,
                    informed them that the place would be captured within twenty-four hours by
                    Virginia troops. He urged them to protect the property, and join the Southern
                    cause, promising, if war ensued, that the place would be held by the South, and
                    that they would be continued at work on high wages. His influence with the men
                    was great, and most of them decided to accept his advice. But Lieutenant Roger
                    Jones, who commanded the guard of forty-five men, hearing what was going on, at
                    once took measures to destroy the place if necessary. Trains gunpowder  were laid through the buildings to be fired. In the shops the men
                    of Southern sympathies managed to wet the powder in many places during the
                    night, rendering it harmless. Jones's troops, however, held the arsenal
                    buildings and stores, and when their commander was advised of Harper's rapid
                    approach the gunpowder was fired, and he crossed into Maryland with his handful
                    of men. So we secured only the machinery and the gun and pistol barrels and
                    locks, which, however, were sent to Richmond and Columbia, South Carolina, and
                    were worked over into excellent arms.</p>
<p>Within a week about thirteen hundred Virginia volunteers had assembled there. As
                    these companies were, in fact, a part of the State militia, they were legally
                    under command of the three brigadiers and one major-general of militia, who had
                    authority over this, that, or the other organization. These generals surrounded
                    themselves with a numerous staff, material for which was abundant in the rank
                    and file of the volunteers; for instance, in my battery there were at least a
                    dozen college graduates of and below the grade of corporal. Every fair afternoon
                    the official display in Harper's Ferry of "fuss and feathers" would have done no
                    discredit to the Champs Elysees.</p>
<p>One afternoon, six or eight days after our occupation, General Harper sent for
                    me, as the senior artillery officer (we then had three batteries, but all
                    without horses), to say he had been told that a number of trains on the
                    Baltimore and Ohio railroad would try to pass us in the night, transporting
                    troops from the West to Washington, and that he had decided to prevent  them at the risk of bringing on a battle. He ordered the posting
                    of guns so as to command the road for half a mile or more, all to be accurately
                    trained on the track by the light of day, and ready to be discharged at any
                    moment. Infantry companies were stationed to fire into the trains, if the
                    artillery failed to stop them. Pickets were posted out two or three miles, with
                    orders to fire signal-guns as soon as the first troop-laden train should pass.
                    About 1 o'clock at night we heard the rumbling of an approaching train. The long
                    roll was beat; the men assembled at their assigned positions and in silence
                    awaited the sound of the signal-guns. A nervous cavalryman was the vedette. As
                    the train passed him (it was the regular mail) he thought he saw soldiers in it,
                    and fired. Pop! pop! pop! came down the road from successive sentries. Primers
                    were inserted and lanyards held taut, to be pulled when the engine should turn a
                    certain point four hundred yards distant from the battery. By great good luck
                    Colonel William S. H. Baylor, commanding the 5th Virginia regiment, was with
                    some of his men stationed a little beyond the point, and, seeing no troops
                    aboard the train, signaled it to stop. It did so, not one hundred yards beyond
                    where the artillery would have opened on it. When the first excitement was over,
                    he demanded of the conductor what troops, if any, were on board, and was told
                    there was "one old fellow in uniform asleep on the mail-bags in the first car."
                    Entering that car with a file of soldiers, he secured the third prisoner of war
                    taken in Virginia. It proved to be Brigadier-General W. S. Harvey, of the United
                    States army, on his way from the West to Washington, to resign his commission
                    and go to Europe rather than engage in a fratricidal war. He surrendered with a
                    pleasant remark, and was taken to General Harper's headquarters, where he spent
                    the night. On his assurance that he knew of no troops coming from the West,
                    Harper ordered us all to quarters. Next morning General Harvey was paroled to
                    report in Richmond, and was escorted to a train about to leave for Winchester.
                    He was a fine-looking old soldier, and as he walked down the street to the depot
                    he saw all our forces except the cavalry. He was accompanied socially by two or
                    three of our generals and a swarm of staff-officers. He cast his glance over the
                    few hundred men in sight, and turning to General Harper, I heard him inquire,
                    with a merry twinkle in his eye, "Where is your army  encamped,
                    general?" Harper's face crimsoned as he replied, "Excuse me from giving
                    information." Harney smiled, and said politely,
                    "Pardon me for asking an improper question, but I had forgotten I was a
                    prisoner." He went on to Richmond, was treated with marked courtesy, and in a
                    day or two proceeded to Washington.</p>
<p>In a few days our forces began to increase by the arrival of fresh volunteer
                    companies. Being only a captain, I was kept very busy in trying to get my
                    battery into the best condition. We had no caissons and but insufficient
                    harness. For the latter I sent to Baltimore, purchasing on my private credit. In
                    the same way I ordered from Richmond red flannel shirts and other clothing for
                    all my men, our uniforms being too fine for camp life. The governor subsequently
                    ordered these bills to be paid by the State treasurer. We found at the armory a
                    large number of very strong horse-carts. In my battery were thirty or more
                    excellent young mechanics. By using the wheels and axles of the carts they soon
                    constructed good caissons, which served us till after the first battle of Bull
                    Run.</p>
<p>We had no telegraph line to Richmond except via Washington, and the time of
                    communication by mail was two days. General Harper found it so difficult to
                    obtain needed munitions and supplies, that about the last of April he decided to
                    send me to the governor, who was my intimate friend, with a requisition for all
                    we needed, and verbal instructions to make to him a full statement of our
                    necessitous and defenseless condition, in case General Robert Patterson, who was
                    reported with a Federal force at Chambersburg, should move against us. When I
                    arrived in Richmond, General Robert E. Lee had been placed in command of all the
                    Virginia forces by the governor, and by an ordinance every militia officer in
                    the State above the rank of captain had been decapitated, and the governor and
                    his small military council had been authorized to fill vacancies thus created.
                    This was a disastrous blow to "the pomp and circumstance of glorious war" at
                    Harper's Ferry. Militia generals and the brilliant "staff" were stricken down,
                    and their functions devolved, according to Governor Letcher's order of April
                    27th, upon Thomas J. Jackson, colonel commandant, and James W. 
                    Massie, major and assistant adjutant-general, who arrived during the first week
                    of May.</p>
<p>This was "Stonewall" Jackson's first appearance on the theater of the war. I
                    spent one day and night in Richmond, and then returned to camp, arriving about 2
                    P. M. What a revolution three or four days had wrought! I could scarcely realize
                    the change. The militia generals were all gone, and the staff had vanished. The
                    commanding colonel and his adjutant had arrived, and were occupying a small room
                    in the little wayside hotel near the railroad bridge. Knowing them both, I
                    immediately sought an interview, and delivered a letter and some papers I had
                    brought from General Lee. Jackson and his adjutant were at a little pine table
                    figuring upon the rolls of the troops present. They were dressed in well-worn,
                    dingy uniforms of professors in the Virginia Military Institute, where both had
                    recently occupied chairs. Colonel Jackson had issued and sent to the camps a
                    short, simple order assuming the command, but had had no intercourse with the
                    troops. The deposed officers had nearly all left for home or for Richmond in a
                    high state of indignation. After an interview of perhaps a half hour I proceeded
                    to my camp on the hill, and found the men of the 5th Virginia regiment, from my
                    own county, in assembly, and greatly excited. They were deeply attached to their
                    field-officers, and regarded the ordinance of the convention as an outrage on
                    freemen and volunteers, and were discussing the propriety of passing
                    denunciatory resolutions. On seeing me they called for a speech. As I did not
                    belong to the regiment, I declined to say anything, but ordered the men of the
                    Staunton Artillery to fall into line. Then I briefly told them that we were
                    required to muster into service either for twelve months or during the war, at
                    our option, and urged them to go in for the full period of the war, as such
                    action would be most creditable to them, and a good example to others. They
                    unanimously shouted, " For the war! For the war!" Before they were dismissed the
                    ceremony of mustering in was completed, and I proudly took the roll down to
                    Colonel Jackson with the remark, "There, colonel, is the roll of your first
                    company mustered in for the war." He looked it over, and, rising, shook my hand,
                    saying, "Thank you, captain -- thank you; and please thank your men for me." He
                    had heard that there was dissatisfaction in the camps, and asked me to act as
                    mustering officer for two other artillery companies present. Before sunset the
                    rolls were returned. This prompt action of the batteries was emulated the next
                    day by the other troops, and all were mustered in. Within a week Governor
                    Letcher wisely appointed Major-General Harper colonel of the 5th Virginia,
                    Brigadier-General Har-man lieutenant-colonel, and Colonel Baylor
                    major, and I venture to say no regiment in either army was better officered, as
                    the fame it won in the "Stonewall" brigade will prove. The presence of a master
                    mind was visible in the changed condition of the camp. Perfect order reigned
                    everywhere. Instruction in the details of military duties occupied Jackson's
                    whole time. He urged the officers to call upon him for information about even
                    the minutest details of duty, often remarking that it was no discredit to a
                    civilian to be ignorant of military matters. He was a rigid disciplinarian, and
                    yet as gentle and kind as a woman. He was the easiest man in our army to get
                    along with pleasantly so long as one did his duty, but as inexorable as fate in
                    exacting the performance of it; yet he would overlook serious faults if he saw
                    they were the result of ignorance, and would instruct the offender in a kindly
                    way. He was as courteous to the humblest private who sought an interview for any
                    purpose as to the highest officer in his command. He despised superciliousness
                    and self-assertion, and nothing angered him so quickly as to see an officer
                    wound the feelings of those under him by irony or sarcasm.</p>
<p>When Jackson found we were without artillery horses, he went into no red-tape
                    correspondence with the circumlocution offices in Richmond, but ordered his
                    quartermaster, Major John A. Harman, to proceed with men to the Quaker
                    settlements in the rich county of Loudoun, famous for its good horses, and buy
                    or impress as many as we needed. Harman executed his orders with such energy and
                    dispatch that he won Jackson's confidence, and remained his chief quartermaster
                    till the day of Jackson's death.</p>
<p>By Jackson's orders I took possession of the bridge across the Potomac at Point
                    of Rocks, twelve miles below Harper's Ferry, and fortified the Virginia end of
                    the bridge, as we expected a visit any night from General B. F. Butler, who was
                    at the Relay House on the Baltimore and Ohio railroad. It was my habit to keep
                    awake all night to be ready for emergencies, and to sleep in the day-time,
                    making daily reports, night and morning, to Jackson. One Sunday afternoon, a
                    little over a week after we occupied this post, I was aroused, from my nap by
                    one of my men, who said there were two men in blue uniforms (we had not yet
                    adopted the gray) riding about our camp, and looking so closely at everything
                    that he believed they were spies. I went out to see who they were, and found
                    Jackson and one of his staff. As I approached them, he put his finger on his
                    lips and shook his head as a signal for silence. In a low tone he said he
                    preferred it should not be known he had come there. He approved of all I had
                    done, and soon galloped away. I afterward suspected that the visit was simply to
                    familiarize himself with the line of the canal and railroad from Point of Rocks
                    to Harper's Ferry preparatory to a sharp bit of strategy which he practiced a
                    few days later.</p>
<p>From the very beginning of the war the Confederacy was greatly in need of
                    rolling-stock for the railroads. We were particularly short of locomotives, and
                    were without the shops to build them. Jackson, appreciating this, hit upon a
                    plan to obtain a good supply from the Baltimore and Ohio road. Its line was
                    double-tracked, at least from Point of Rocks Martinsburg, a distance of 25 or 30
                    miles. We had not interfered with the running  of trains, except on
                    the occasion of the arrest of General Harney. The coal
                    traffic from Cumberland was immense, as the Washington government was
                    accumulating supplies of coal on the seaboard. These coal trains passed Harper's
                    Ferry at all hours of the day and night, and thus furnished Jackson with a
                    pretext for arranging a brilliant "scoop." When he sent me to Point of Rocks, he
                    ordered Colonel Harper with the 5th Virginia Infantry to Martinsburg. He then
                    complained to President Garrett, of the Baltimore and Ohio, that the night
                    trains, eastward bound, disturbed the repose of his camp, and requested a change
                    of schedule that would pass all east-bound trains by Harper's Ferry between 11
                    and 1 o'clock in the day-time. Mr. Garrett complied, and thereafter for several
                    days we heard the constant roar of passing trains for an hour before and an hour
                    after noon. But since the "empties" were sent up the road at night, Jackson
                    again complained that the nuisance was as great as ever, and, as the road had
                    two tracks, said he must insist that the west-bound trains should pass during
                    the same two hours as those going east. Mr. Garrett promptly complied, and we
                    then had, for two hours every day, the liveliest railroad in America. One night,
                    as soon as the schedule was working at its best, Jackson sent me an order to
                    take a force of men across to the Maryland side of the river the next day at 11
                    o'clock, and, letting all west-bound trains pass till 12 o'clock, to permit none
                    to go east, and at 12 o'clock to obstruct the road so that it would require
                    several days to repair it. He ordered the reverse to be done at Martinsburg.
                    Thus he caught all the trains that were going east or west between those points,
                    and these he ran up to Winchester, thirty-two miles on the branch road, where
                    they were safe, and whence they were removed by horse-power to the railway at
                    Strasburg. I do not remember the number of trains captured, but the loss
                    crippled the Baltimore and Ohio road seriously for some time, and the gain to
                    our scantily stocked Virginia roads of the same gauge was invaluable.</p>
<p>While we held the Point of Rocks bridge, J. E. B. Stuart (afterward so famous as
                    a cavalry leader) was commissioned lieutenant-colonel, and reported to Colonel
                    Jackson for assignment to duty. Jackson ordered the consolidation of all the
                    cavalry companies into a battalion to be commanded by Stuart, who then appeared
                    more like a well-grown, manly youth than the mature man he really was. This
                    order was very offensive to Captain Turner Ashby, at that time the idol of all
                    the troopers in the field, as well he might be, for a more brave and chivalrous
                    officer never rode at the head of well-mounted  troopers. Ashby was
                    older than Stuart, and he thought, and we all believed, that he was entitled to
                    first promotion. When not absent scouting, Ashby spent his nights with me at the
                    bridge. He told me of Jackson's order, and that he would reply to it with his
                    resignation. I expostulated with him, although he had all my sympathies. I urged
                    him to call upon Colonel Jackson that night. It was only twelve miles by the
                    tow-path of the canal, and on his black Arabian he could make it in less than an
                    hour. I believed Jackson would respect his feelings and leave his company out of
                    Stuart's battalion. I ventured to write a private letter to Jackson, appealing
                    in the strongest terms for the saving of Ashby to the service. The result of his
                    night ride was that Jackson not only relieved him from the obnoxious order, but
                    agreed to divide the companies between him and Stuart, and to ask for his
                    immediate promotion, forming thus the nuclei of two regiments of cavalry, to be
                    filled as rapidly as new companies came to the front. One of these regiments was
                    commanded at first by Colonel Angus McDonald, with Ashby as lieutenant-colonel,
                    and in a few months Ashby was promoted to its full command. Ashby got back to
                    Point of Rocks about 2 in the morning, as happy a man as I ever saw, and
                    completely enraptured with Jackson. From that night on, the affection and
                    confidence of the two men were remarkable. A trip Ashby had made a few days
                    before to Chambersburg and the encampment of General Robert Patterson was the
                    real reason for Jackson's favor. Ashby had rigged himself in a farmer's suit of
                    homespun that he had borrowed, and, hiring a plow-horse, had personated a rustic
                    horse-doctor. With his saddle-bags full of some remedy for spavin or ringbone,
                    he had gone to Chambersburg, and had returned in the night with an immense
                    amount of information. The career of Ashby was a romance from that time on till
                    he fell, shot through the heart, two days before the battle of Cross Keys.</p>
<p>May 23d, 1861, Colonel Jackson was superseded in command at Harper's Ferry by
                    Brigadier-General Joseph E. Johnston. When General Johnston arrived several
                    thousand men had been assembled there, representing nearly all the seceded
                    States east of the Mississippi River. Johnston at once began the work of
                    organization on a larger scale than Jackson had attempted. He brigaded the
                    troops, and assigned Colonel Jackson to the command of the exclusively Virginia
                    brigade. The latter was almost immediately commissioned 
                    brigadier-general, and when on the 15th of June Johnston withdrew from Harper's
                    Ferry to Winchester, he kept Jackson at the front along the Baltimore and Ohio
                    road to observe General Patterson's preparations. Nothing of much importance
                    occurred for several weeks, beyond a little affair near Martinsburg in which
                    Jackson captured about forty men of a reconnoitering party sent out by
                    Patterson. His vigilance was ceaseless, and General Johnston felt sure, at
                    Winchester, of ample warning of any aggressive movement of the enemy.</p>
