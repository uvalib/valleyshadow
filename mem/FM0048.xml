                <p>This news article contains several long quotations from B. F. Myers, a prominent
                    Democratic politician, regarding Lincoln. Myers was continually anti-Lincoln,
                    even after Lincoln's assassination.</p>

                <p>In March 1865, (see the Bedford <hi rend="underline">Gazette</hi>, of March
                    31, 1865,) B. F. Myers, the Democratic candidate for Congress, encouraged the
                    soldiers of the Republic in the army, and the friends of the Union throughout
                    the land, in the following manner:</p>
                <p>"DO THE PEOPLE SUSTAIN THE WAR?-The re-election of Mr. Lincoln to the Presidency,
                    is regarded by many simple-minded persons as proof positive of the popular
                    approval of the policy of military coercion. Had there been a free and fair
                    election, and had the result proved the same, there might be some ground for
                    this misconceived notion. But even then, under the condition of things that
                    prevails now, there would have been excellent reasons to doubt that the majority
                    expressed their true sentiments in voting for Mr. Lincoln. It is certainly not
                    to be denied that the people, the majority, do no longer voluntarily sustain the
                    war. They do sustain it, <hi rend="underline">but it is upon
                    compulsion</hi>. Nobody volunteers now, except for lucre. Nobody goes into the
                    service, unless he cannot keep out of it. The loudest war shriekers pay the
                    highest prices to keep their carcasses clear of "government blue." The most
                    zealous advocates of military coercion, foreswear their own souls, rather than
                    shoulder the musket they are called upon to carry. Nay, there is, now-a-days,
                    not one man in fifty, who from mere motives of patriotism, goes into the ranks
                    of the Federal armies. In short, the people of the loyal states are compelled,
                    against their own will, to support the policy of the administration in
                    continuing the war. If this be not so, why is it that we have a <hi
                        rend="underline">compulsory</hi> draft every few weeks? or why is it that
                    every hamlet and cross-roads in the country, is made the rendezvous of a provost
                    guard? No, no, the truth is plain and not to be hidden. The majority of the
                    people do not heartily, or willingly sustain the continuation of the war. Men
                    may dislike the assertion of this truth, but it <hi rend="underline">is</hi>
                    truth, nevertheless. It is a fact so self-evident that the most subtle advocate
                    of the war will not attempt to cover it from public discernment. Since such is
                    the state of things, is Mr. Lincoln now obeying the will of the people? That is
                    the question. Let his friends answer it, if they can."</p>
                <p>Soon after this publication Abraham Lincoln was assassinated. The manner in which
                    this act was received throughout the country, and the world, did not seem to be
                    pleasing to the present Democratic candidate. It does not appear however to have
                    driven from him the pious frame of mind into which he had previously fallen. The
                    Bedford Gazette, of April 28, 1865, contained the following:</p>
                <p>THE IDOLATRY OF THE TIME.-Hero worship is the besetting sin of nations. A
                    successful general, a great ruler, or very frequently a hideous impostor, is
                    made the idol of the people's hearts, until the Almighty Iconoclast strikes out
                    of existence the god created in His stead. Attachment to princes and rulers is
                    eminently right and proper. Due respect for those who administer the laws,
                    should be shown in the deportment of every citizen.-But when mere man comes to
                    be worshipped as a god, when the soul's affections are drawn away from Calvary
                    and fixed upon some fancied earthly hero, when attachment for rulers and respect
                    for those who administer the laws, grow into adoration of their persons and
                    character, <hi rend="underline">idolatry</hi> and not christianity becomes
                    the religion of the people. Further removed from heaven than the <orig
                        reg="Hindu">Hindoo</orig> or New Zealander, is he who, in the light of God's
                    revealed truth sets upon his heart, the false god of supposed mortal perfection.
                    Better, far better, to be ignorant of the blessed Gospel of peace, then knowing
                    it, to mock its Divine Author, by the practice of idolatry beneath the very
                    Cross which it reveals. And yet in this very hour and in this very community,
                    men professing to be Christians are guilty of this deadly sin. Nay ministers of
                    the gospel themselves, set their hearers the example in this worship of human
                    idols. The text is no longer "Christ and Him crucified," but <hi
                        rend="underline">Abraham Lincoln and him Assassinated</hi>. Nor are their
                    discourses confined to reproof of the spirit which prompted the foul deed of the
                    President's murder, or to efforts to correct the state of the public morals
                    which the circumstances of his death so clearly indicate. In that case there
                    would be but little room for complaint. But their sermons are mere fulsome
                    eulogies and high sounding panegyrics of a man about whose public career people
                    have always differed. They impiously compare him to Moses, styling him "God's
                    anointed," at the same time, like the Pharsee, thanking God that they are "not
                    as other men are," <hi rend="underline">their</hi> hearts never having
                    harbored an ill thought of the lamented dead.-Nay, they go further and declare
                    they can have no respect for those who do not regard the memory of the late
                    President as they do, and that such persons cannot be considered as Christians.
                    If the conduct of these preachers be not idolatrous, then the veriest giaour is
                    a believer of the gospel. But the consequences of their stewardship will be upon
                    their own heads, and at their hands will be required the souls of those whom
                    their idolatrous conduct, coupled with their intolerant utterances, have driven
                    from the sanctuary of the living God."</p>
