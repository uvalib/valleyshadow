<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> In 1914, Kauffman's Progressive reprinted this article--which originally appeared
                    in 1862--that records a general order giving honors to the 77th Pa. Volunteers
                    and describing a "floating hospital" created in the state to deal with Union
                    wounded.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Hospital at Yorktown</p>
<p>Harrisburg, April 30-The following order has just been issued:</p>
<p>General order No. 21. Head Quarters, Penna. Militia, Harrisburg, April 30, 1862.</p>
<p>In acknowledgment of the gallantry of the Seventy-seventh Regiment of Infantry
                    Pennsylvania Volunteers, Colonel F. S. Stumbaugh commanding at Shiloh,
                    Tennessee, and of the First Regiment of Cavalry, Pennsylvania Volunteers,
                    Colonel George D. Bayard commanding, at Falmouth, Virginia, it is ordered that
                    "Shiloh, April 7th 1862", be inscribed on the flag of the First Regiment of
                    Cavalry, and that this order be read at the head of all the regiments of
                    Pennsylvania Volunteers.</p>
<p>By order of A. G. Curtin, Governor and Commander-in-chief,<br> (Signed) A. L.
                    Russel, Adj. Gen.</p>
<p>The Governor has received, through Adj.
                    Gen. Russel, the most gratifying intelligence from Surgeon-General Smith,
                    near Yorktown, in relation to the perfected arrangements for the care and prompt
                    transportation of the killed and wounded Pennsylvania soldiers to points within
                    the State. The floating hospital under his charge will accommodate over 300
                    patients, and reach Philadelphia via the Delaware and Chesapeake Canal, thus
                    avoiding the roughness of a sea passage. He concludes by saying that
                    Pennsylvania is the only state the peninsula fully prepared for every emergency,
                    and that these preparations will undoubtedly be instrumental in saving the lives
                    of hundreds of brave men that would otherwise be lost for want of care and
                    proper accommodation.</p>
