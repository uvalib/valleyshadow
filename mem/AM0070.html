<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> Short inquiry listing from Staunton woman, requesting news/knowledge of her
                    uncles' Confederate service</p>
<p>Mrs. J. F. F. Cassell, of Staunton, Va., desires to
                    hear from surviving comrades of any of her six uncles, Samuel, Adam, John,
                    William, Levi, and David Plecker. She would like to know the companies in which
                    they served during the war. They were reared near Centerville (now Milnesville),
                    Augusta County, Va., and some of them later lived
                    in Rockingham County. She inquires also for the company in which Isaac Smoot,
                        M.D., of Madison County, Va., was enlisted.</p>
