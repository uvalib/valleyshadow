                            1899</h3>
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> This article consists mostly of a poem by A. C. Gordon of Staunton, read at the
                    unveiling of the monument erected to the Confederate dead at Staunton, Va.</p>
<p>
                    <u>To the Editor of the Times:</u>
                </p>
<p>In reading the excellent address of Capt. R. S.
                    Parks to the veterans [see ante pp. 354-364], as reported in your paper, and the
                    beautiful and fitting verses with which he closed, it occurred to me that you
                    would enjoy, if you have never seen it, or read it, the entire poem as delivered
                    by the author, the Hon. A. C. Gordon, of
                    Staunton, Va., upon the occasion of unveiling the
                    monument erected to the Confederate dead at Staunton, Va., and I enclose you a copy. The late Professor George Fred. Holmes
                    told the writer of this that he considered Mr. Armistead Gordon's poem "the
                    finest on such an occasion he had read since the war." With many other
                    distinguishing qualities, I am happy that Virginia has in this son one who
                    writes so beautifully in verse.*<br>* He has written as well in prose. it
                        may be assumed, for, as fellow student with Thomas Nelson Page at the
                        University of Virginia, he yielded to the latter (it has been admitted),
                        some conceptions-upon which our dialect writer rose to fame and
                    wealth.</p>

<p>THE CONFEDERATE DEAD.</p>
<p>"The grief that circled his brow with a crown of thorns was also that which
                    wreathed them with the splendor of immortality." - <u>Castelar's "Savonarola."</u></p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>Where are they who marched away,<br> Sped with smiles that changed to
                    tears,<br> Glittering lines of steel and gray<br> Moving down the battle's
                    way-<br> Where are they these many years?</p>
<p>Garlands wreathed their shining swords;<br> They were girt about with
                    cheers,<br> Children's lispings, women's words,<br> Sunshine and the songs of
                    birds-<br> They are gone so many years.</p>
<p>"Lo! beyond their brave array<br> Freedom's august dawn appears:"<br> Thus we
                    said: "The brighter day<br> Breaks above that line of gray."-<br> Where are
                    they these many years?</p>
<p>All our hearts went with them there,<br> All our love, and all our prayers;<br>
                    What of them? How do they fare,<br> They who went to do and dare,<br> And are
                    gone so many years?</p>
<p>What of them who went away<br> Followed by our hopes and fears?<br> Braver
                    never marched than they,<br> Closer ranks to fiercer fray.-<br> Where are they
                    these many years?</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>Borne upon the Spartan shield<br> Home returned that brave array<br> From the
                    blood-stained battle-field<br> They might neither win nor yield;<br> That is
                    all, and here are they.</p>
<p>That is all, The soft sky bends<br>O'er them, lapped in
                    earth away;<br> Her benignest influence lends,<br> Dews and rains and radiance
                    sends<br> Down upon them, night and day.</p>
<p>Over them the Springtide weaves<br> All the verdure of her May:<br> Past them
                    drift the sombre leaves<br> When the heart of Autumn
                        grieves<br>O'er their slumbers.-What care they?</p>
<p>What care they, who failed to win<br> Guerdon of that splendid day-<br>
                    Freedom's day-they saw begin,<br> But that, 'mid the
                    battle's din,<br> Faded in eclipse away?</p>
<p>All is gone for them. They gave<br> All for naught. It was their way<br> Where
                    they loved. They died to save<br> What was lost. The fight was brave.<br> That
                    is all; and here are they.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>Is that all? Was duty naught?<br> Love and Faith made blind with tears?<br>
                    What the lessons that they taught?<br> What the glory that they caught<br>
                    From the onward sweeping years?</p>
<p>Here are they who marched away,<br> Followed by our hopes and fears;<br> Nobler
                    never went than they<br> To a bloodier, madder fray,<br> In the lapse of all
                    the years.</p>
<p>Garlands still shall wreathe the swords<br> That they drew amid our cheers;<br>
                    Children's lispings, women's words,<br> Sunshine, and the songs of birds<br>
                    Greet them here through all the years.</p>
<p>With them ever shall abide<br> All our love and all our prayers.<br> "What of
                    them?" The battle's tide<br> Hath not scathed them. Lo, they ride<br> Still
                    with Stuart down the years.</p>
<p>Where are they who went away,<br> Sped with smiles that changed to tears?<br>
                    Lee yet leads the lines of gray-<br> Stonewall still rides down this way;<br>
                    They are Fame's through all the years.</p>
