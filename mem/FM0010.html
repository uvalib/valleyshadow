<h3 class="section-head">Franklin: "Chapter XXXIX. The Lincoln Victory.," by Alexander K.
                            McClure, 1905</h3>
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> McClure describes his work as manager of Andrew Curtin's gubernatorial campaign
                    in 1860. He also discusses the ways in which the split in the national
                    Democratic party affected state politics.</p>
<p>There never was a party with abler leadership than had the Democrats of
                    Pennsylvania when the campaign of 1860 was about to be opened. The Democratic
                    leaders of that day were men of eminent ability and ripe experience in political
                    management, and they acted with great fidelity to their party organization.
                    There was no such thing as a party boss on either side, and if any man or
                    factional combination had attempted to issue orders to the State conventions of
                    either of the parties about to meet in battle it would not only 
                    have been resented, but such leadership would have been sent to the rear without
                    ceremony.</p>
<p>Such men as J. Glancey Jones, of Berks; Judge Campbell and Chambers McKibben, of
                    Philadelphia; Arnold Plummer, of Venango; John L. Dawson, of Fayette; George W.
                    Cass and James P. Barr, of Pittsburg; State Chairman Ward, of Bradford; Senator
                    Buckalew, of Columbia; Senator Bigler, of Clearfield; James Burns, of Mifflin;
                    A. Porter Wilson, of Huntingdon, and many others who had attained distinction in
                    the Democratic counsels, came to the front, not to battle for individual mastery
                    but to consider calmly how Democratic supremacy could be regained in
                    Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Their convention met at Reading before the Democratic National convention had
                    split, and presented two candidates for the Presidency, and all were hopeful
                    that, notwithstanding the clouds which hung over party harmony, the party North
                    and South would be thoroughly united and would win in both State and nation.
                    There were a number of candidates for the Democratic nomination for Governor,
                    and several of them men who would have made creditable leaders in the contest,
                    but it was decided after most careful consideration of existing political
                    conditions that Henry D. Foster, of Westmoreland, was altogether the strongest
                    man who could be presented against Curtin, and he was nominated amidst the
                    wildest enthusiasm.</p>
<p>While the Democrats had many able men, there was no one of them so well equipped
                    for the great battle of 1860 as was Henry D. Foster. He was confessedly the
                    ablest and best trial lawyer in western Pennsylvania, and a gentleman as genial
                    in his personal qualities as he was blameless in reputation. He was one of the
                    most amiable men I have ever met in public life, and  if Henry D.
                    Foster had a personal enemy it was not because any intentional affront had ever
                    been given.</p>
<p>He had been active in politics for many years. As early as 1842 he had been
                    elected to Congress without opposition when not yet thirty years of age, and was
                    re-elected in 1844. Before his term had expired in Congress he was elected to
                    the popular branch of the Pennsylvania Legislature in 1846, was re-elected the
                    following year, and was again elected to the House in 1856. After his defeat for
                    Governor in 1860, he retired from active participation in politics until 1870,
                    when he was again elected to Congress, and in 1872 he was defeated in a contest
                    for re-election.</p>
<p>The friends of Curtin well appreciated the fact that in Foster they had
                    altogether the strongest candidate that could be presented against him, and if
                    the Democratic National convention had not broken up and presented two National
                    tickets, the contest for Governor in Pennsylvania would certainly have been
                    doubtful, with chances rather in favor of Foster. His nomination inspired the
                    Democratic party with a degree of confidence its people had not felt for several
                    years, and on every side the indications were that the Democrats were in a
                    position to make a desperately close if not a successful battle.</p>
<p>Senator William Henry Welsh, of York, who was then the Democratic leader of the
                    Senate, presided over the convention, and after the nomination of Foster the
                    convention departed from the customary method of choosing a State chairman by
                    unanimously electing Senator Welsh as field marshal of their great battle. The
                    Legislature was then in session, and on his return to the senate I congratulated
                    my fellow senator on the distinction he had achieved with probably quite as much
                    sincerity as he had previously congratulated me when my appointment as chairman
                    of the Curtin com-mittee was announced. I think it quite likely
                    that either of us would have been glad to congratulate some other person as his
                    immediate foeman in the struggle.</p>
<p>Welsh was an accomplished and skillful politician with all the sagacity and tact
                    necessary to make him a master leader. He was then serving his second term in
                    the senate, and as I had served two previous sessions in the house, and had
                    intimate fellowship with him, the closest ties of personal friendship had grown
                    up between us. We were both among the youngest members of the body, engaged in
                    the same profession, and I at times protected him from drastic partisan
                    legislation aimed at him personally as the Democratic leader. During my first
                    year in the senate the Democrats had but twelve members to twenty-one
                    Republicans, and in the session of 1861 the Democrats were reduced to six, with
                    twenty-seven Republicans.</p>
<p>The Democratic National convention first met at Charleston on the 23d of April,
                    and after wrangling for ten days adjourned to meet at Baltimore on the 18th of
                    June. The bolters from the Charleston convention adjourned to meet in Richmond
                    on the 11th of June, but on meeting they adjourned until the 21st, being three
                    days after the meeting of the regular convention in Baltimore, with the view of
                    harmonizing on a ticket if possible. The Baltimore convention declared Douglas
                    the Democratic nominee, and the Richmond convention then rejected both Douglas
                    and the platform and nominated Breckinridge and Lane.</p>
<p>While a large majority of the Democrats of Pennsylvania were in sympathy with
                    Douglas as against Breckinridge, the entire patronage of the Buchanan
                    administration was thrown into the breach against Douglas, and the factional
                    conflict became extremely bitter and greatly chilled the hopes of Democratic
                        victory.</p>
<p>After much tribulation and many vexatious conferences, the opposing wings of the
                    party agreed upon an electoral ticket that was pledged to vote unitedly for
                    either of the Democratic candidates for President if thereby he could be
                    elected, but was at liberty to vote individual preferences, if elected, in case
                    the united vote of the electors of the State would not give success to either.
                    No such fusion would have been attempted but for the hope that thereby Foster
                    might be elected, and the unanimity in favor of Foster was shown in a very
                    hiatic way by the fact that, while he was on the stump almost continuously for
                    several months, no one ever asked him to define his position on the Presidency.
                    He was a man of fine presence, of charming manners, a most adroit and able
                    political disputant, and both wings of the party supported him.</p>
<p>An interesting incident occurred some time after the campaign was fairly under
                    way, and Curtin and Foster were speaking daily in different sections of the
                    State, showing how things have sometimes to be done under cover in great
                    political struggles. While Foster was one of the coolest and most unimpassioned
                    of popular speakers, Curtin was nothing if not impulsive and enthusiastic. In
                    one of his speeches in the western part of the State he was criticising Foster's
                    straddling attitude on the Presidency, and thoughtlessly stated that he would be
                    glad to meet him and have him discuss the issue of the contest face to face. It
                    was a passing thought with Curtin, and he never intended it to be accepted as a
                    challenge to Foster, but it was so proclaimed by the papers supporting Curtin,
                    and Foster was called upon by the Democratic organs to respond by meeting Curtin
                    in joint debate.</p>
<p>Foster addressed a letter to Chairman Welsh, who had his headquarters at the
                    Merchants' Hotel, stating that as Curtin had challenged him to a joint
                    discussion,  he could do no less than accept it, and instructed him
                    to meet me and complete the necessary arrangements.</p>
<p>There was only one way for Welsh to meet the emergency, and that was to address a
                    defiant letter to me stating that, as Curtin had challenged Foster to a joint
                    discussion, Foster was quite willing to accept it, and asking me to meet him and
                    arrange the details. I could do no less than answer as defiantly as Welsh had
                    written, without intimating that Curtin had not intended his remarks to be
                    accepted as a challenge, and declared my willingness to meet Chairman Welsh at
                    any time and place he might name, to fix an acceptable programme for the two
                    candidates for Governor.</p>
<p>Welsh replied expressing his gratification in the strongest terms that his
                    candidate would have the opportunity of meeting Curtin, and named the next day
                    at one o'clock for me to meet him at his headquarters at the Merchants' Hotel.</p>
<p>I was there promptly on time, and, of course, received a very cordial greeting
                    from my warm personal friend, the Democratic chairman. He had cigars and a
                    rather dark-hued bottle on the table, with glasses and ice water, and
                    immediately proposed that we take a drink.</p>
<p>After refreshment we took our cigars, sat down and chatted for half an hour or
                    more without referring to the campaign, and finally Welsh inquired whether it
                    would be agreeable to me to adjourn the meeting to a time several days distant,
                    as he had an important appointment out of the city, and he wished to have ample
                    time to arrange for the discussion. He did not intend that I should
                    misunderstand his willingness to avoid a joint discussion if it could be
                    accomplished, and without assuming that I understood him, we adjourned.</p>
<p>We met again promptly on time several days there-after, and Welsh
                    opened the conference with the bottle, ice water, glasses and cigars as before.
                    After refreshments, while enjoying the cigars, we chatted for nearly an hour
                    about legislation and many other things of personal interest, without once
                    alluding to the business which we had met ostensibly to consider. The fact that
                    I did not introduce the subject satisfied Welsh that I was not hungry for a
                    joint debate, and without a word having been said on the subject both well
                    understood that neither desired to consummate the arrangement for a joint
                    discussion.</p>
<p>Finally Welsh took an extra whiff from his cigar, and coming up in front of me,
                    said : "Aleck, you don't want this joint debate, do you?"</p>
<p>To which I answered : "Harry, I don't want it any more than you do."</p>
<p>At this there was a mutual laugh, but we were both soon sobered by the reflection
                    that the public had been assured of this joint discussion, and it would be very
                    difficult for either of us to explain why we had not brought it about when it
                    was known, and had been published all over the State, that the matter was in the
                    hands of Chairman Welsh and myself to arrange the details. We were both in the
                    position that an explanation to the public was an absolute necessity, and to
                    publish the letters which really passed between us would have made it impossible
                    for us to offer any plausible explanation of failure to complete the
                    arrangement.</p>
<p>We finally agreed to destroy all the letters which had passed between us, and to
                    rewrite several letters on each side embracing certain embarrassing conditions,
                    and the letters to be so carefully worded that each side could plausibly claim
                    that the other had refused to have the joint debate. It was quite a serious task
                    and required the most careful political diplomacy, but  we finally
                    got it accomplished to the satisfaction of both, and the next morning the Curtin
                    papers published the correspondence with immense scare-head lines declaring that
                    Foster had declined to meet Curtin, and the Democratic papers published the
                    correspondence with equally flaming headlines declaring that Curtin had refused
                    to meet Foster.</p>
<p>Curtin had no knowledge of these conferences on the subject of a joint discussion
                    until he saw the letters in public print. Welsh had very good reasons for
                    wanting to avoid a joint discussion for the reason that Curtin would have
                    crucified Foster on the altar of his two Presidential candidates, but even with
                    that advantage on Curtin's side Foster would have maintained himself creditably.</p>
<p>My reason for very willingly assenting to the rejection of the proposed joint
                    discussion was that I regarded it as most important to Curtin to cover the
                    entire State in his campaign, and the joint discussions would have brought him
                    away from the rural districts where his presence and speeches accomplished so
                    much, as the joint discussions would necessarily have been in the important
                    centers of population throughout the State, in many of which Cumin had already
                    spoken. His personality was altogether the most important factor in the contest,
                    and it was specially important that he should meet the masses in every section
                    of the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>Welsh and I often met during the progress of the fight, and within a week after
                    our correspondence had been published we each had the pleasure of informing the
                    other that our principals were highly delighted with our disposition of the
                    joint debate proposition.</p>
<p>After the two Democratic National tickets had been formally placed in the field
                    without the hope of adjustment, the popular tide was steadily against the  Democrats in Pennsylvania, but their leaders made the most heroic
                    struggle to save Foster. Our opposition elements were naturally more cordially
                    united and greatly inspired by the prospect of success, and the result was the
                    election of Curtin by a majority of 32,164.</p>
<p>Henry S. Lane, the Republican candidate for Governor in Indiana, carried his
                    State on the same day by 9,757 majority. The only other States holding elections
                    in October were Ohio and Iowa, and both of them gave large Republican
                    majorities, but Pennsylvania and Indiana were the pivotal States of the battle,
                    and the election of Curtin and Lane in those States irrevocably decided the
                    election of Lincoln in November.</p>
<p>With the sweeping majority for Curtin the Republicans carried 18 of the 25
                    Congressmen, and the Legislature elected made the Senate stand 27 Republicans to
                    6 Democrats, and the House 71 Republicans to 29 Democrats. The great contest in
                    Pennsylvania that had practically decided the judgment of the nation in favor of
                    the great political revolution of 1860, was honestly fought and fairly won, and
                    the only reproach upon our cause that was attempted was in the city of
                    Philadelphia, where, on election night, a sum of money was raised and some
                    Democratic election officers were corrupted to make a false return in favor of
                    the election of Mr. Butler, Republican, over Lehman, Democrat, for Congress. It
                    was a palpable and flagrant fraud, and I learned of it before I went to bed in
                    the early morning hours of election night. I at once went to Colonel Mann, then
                    district attorney, and demanded the immediate prosecution of the corrupt
                    election officers. Mann was a very earnest friend of Butler, but I informed him
                    that no such stain would  be permitted to cloud the great victory
                    we had won. He prosecuted William Bierly and others, convicted them and had them
                    sentenced before the Governor had issued his proclamation declaring who were
                    elected members of Congress. On the strength of those convictions Governor
                    Packer gave the certificate to Lehman, and proclaimed him elected. Butler
                    contested, and I appeared before the Republican committee of Congress, stated
                    the facts and the contest was then ended.</p>
<p>The October elections having practically settled the National contest, the labors
                    of the State organization were greatly diminished. All we had to do was to keep
                    our forces in line by a succession of mass meetings demanded by the enthused
                    conditions of our people. The hopeless condition of the Democracy greatly
                    lessened the interest of the rank and file, but the Democrats of that day were
                    natural voters. Notwithstanding nearly 10,000 Democrats in the city of
                    Philadelphia alone voted for the distinctive Douglas ticket and against the
                    fusion Democratic electoral ticket, they polled 178,871 votes for their regular
                    electoral ticket, while the straight Douglas ticket received 16,765 votes. Bell,
                    the Constitutional Union candidate, received a total of 12,776 in the State,
                    most of which was cast in the city of Philadelphia. Lincoln had 89,159 plurality
                    over the fusion Democratic ticket, and 59,618 majority of the entire vote.</p>
<p>The election of Lincoln almost frenzied the Democrats of Philadelphia, as up to
                    that time they had always treated Republicanism with the utmost contempt, and
                    the kindest term they ever applied was that of "Black Republicans," always
                    associating them with abolitionism and negro equality. The streets of the city
                    were crowded with parading Republican banners which were greeted with hissing
                    scorn, and at  times with volleys of stones from the Democratic
