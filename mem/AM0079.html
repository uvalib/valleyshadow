<h3 class="section-head">Augusta County: "A. H. Roller," by Unknown, 1922</h3>
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> Obituary of Augusta Co. veteran; the obit. notes that Roller reached "the top of
                    the ridge" as part of Pickett's Charge.</p>
<p>Albert H. Roller, Confederate veteran, died at his home near Weyer's Cave, Va., August 31, 1921, in his eighty-fourth year. He
                    was born and reared in Angusta County, Va., a son of John W. and Susan Roller, and a direct
                    descendant of John Roller, a member of Colonel Pasey's regiment during the
                    Revolutionary War, under the command of Washington at the surrender of
                    Cornwallis at Yorktown in 1781.</p>
<p>At the outbreak of the War between the States Albert Roller and three of his
                    brothers enlisted in the Confederate army and served with distinction and
                    gallantry throughout the war. He was at that time in business in Roanoke County,
                    so it was his fortune to cast his lot with Company I, known as the "Roanoke
                    Grays." Early in the spring of 1861 they offered their services to the
                    Confederacy under command of Capt. M. P. Deyerley,
                    and the company became a part of the 28th Virginia Regiment of Infantry. He was
                    a lieutenant in Picketts' charge at Gettysburg, and
                    was one of the few men to reach the <u>top</u> of the
                        <u>ridge</u>. Comrade Roller was a devoted member of
                    Mt. Horeb Presbyterian Church, and an elder in that Church for forty-nine years.
                    He is survived by his wife, who was Miss Ann Carpenter, and three children-Mrs.
                    James B. Rawlings, Herbert H. and J. Wilmer Roller.</p>
