                            Col. A. K. McClure, March 12, 1905</h3>
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> This piece covers the political history of the nominatation of Lincoln for
                    President in 1864 from the viewpoint of A. K. McClure.</p>
<p>The political condition in Pennsylvania at the opening of 1864 was anything but
                    serene. While the Republicans generally accepted and sincerely desired the
                    renomination of President Lincoln, he was very earnest and even bitterly opposed
                    by some of the ablest leaders of the party, and among them Thaddeus Stevens,
                    then the Commoner of the House, who was violent against the policy of the
                    President, while such distinguished leaders as Chase, Wade, Sumner, Chandler,
                    Henry Winter Davis and others, openly proclaimed their purpose to make
                    exhaustive effort to retire Lincoln. The Republicans at that time were in the
                    attitude toward Lincoln that the Democrats were toward Cleveland in 1892. In
                    both cases the people of the party were absolutely and earnestly in support of
                    the candidates, while the leaders of the party were largely against them. The
                    Republican people had absolute faith in Lincoln as the Democrats in 1892 had in
                    Cleveland, and Cameron saw his opportunity to gain power and prestige by taking
                    the lead in an aggressive movement in favor of Lincoln's nomination.</p>
<p>Curtin and his friends were as sincerely in favor of Lincoln as was Cameron, but
                    soon after the Legislature convened in January, Cameron made a quiet combination
                    by which a paper strongly recommending the renomination of Lincoln, was signed
                    by every Republican Senator and Representative at Harrisburg. It was known that
                    the relations between Lincoln and Cameron had been severely strained by
                    Cameron's enforced retirement from the Cabinet in the early part of 1862, and
                    his open advocacy of Lincoln's renomination was not only in accord with the
                    general sentiment of the Republican people, but it had all the marks of a
                    chivalrous act on the part of Cameron. Cameron had not been forced from the
                    Cabinet by Lincoln himself, but by conditions which made it necessary for
                    Lincoln to retire him. He was unfortunate in having a host of friends who were
                    most importunate in demanding official plunder from him, and while his official
                    record in the War Office was free from the stain of corruption on his part,
                    political necessities forced him to give promotion and contracts to men who
                    abused the trust he reposed in them and brought reproach upon his department and
                    the Government.</p>
<p>Cameron knew that the pressure was very strong upon the President to retire him,
                    and whenever the movement assumed some measure of importance he notified the
                    President that his resignation was at the disposal of the President at any time
                    for his acceptance. The culmination came when a committee of financial men found
                    it next to impossible to maintain the credit of the Government, and one of the
                    many grave obstacles in the way was the alleged profligacy and corruption in
                    organizing, equipping and maintaining the army. The committee called upon the
                    President and informed him that it would be impossible to negotiate further
                    loans without a change in the War Department that would hiasize the purpose of
                    the Government to have it administered in severe integrity and economy. Lincoln
                    had Cameron's distinct authority to accept Cameron's resignation at any time and
                    thus retire him from the Cabinet, and without consulting Cameron or Stanton, or
                    any others he wrote a brief letter to Secretary Cameron, simply stating that he
                    had decided to nominate Cameron to the Senate as Minister to Russia, and Edwin
                    M. Stanton to succeed him as Secretary of War.</p>
<p>This letter was given by the President to Secretary Chase with instructions to
                    deliver it to Cameron in person, but Cameron dined with Colonel Forney that
                    evening and Chase did not find him until 10 o'clock that night. Colonel Thomas
                    A. Scott was then Assistant Secretary of War, and I happened to be in Washington
                    that day and spent the evening with Colonel Scott at his office in War
                    Department. About 11 o'clock Secretary Cameron entered Scott's office quite
                    abruptly and betrayed a very unusual measure of excitement for one of Cameron's
                    equable temperament. He came up to the table where Scott and I were sitting and
                    laid down the President's letter. He spoke with great feeling and in a tremulous
                    voice, with tears scalding his cheeks, he said that the President certainly
                    meant to accomplish his destruction. He said to me, that while we had not been
                    political friends, he certainly would not sanction any measure that meant my
                    personal destruction, and he confidently expected that I would not sanction such
                    a measure against him.</p>
<p>Scott, who was wonderfully fertile in invention, told Cameron to sit down and
                    talk the matter over. He said he knew that the President did not intend to offer
                    any personal affront to Cameron, or to destroy him personally or politically,
                    that Lincoln had doubtless written the letter in the curt form it appeared
                    simply because of the terrible pressure that was upon him. He proposed that
                    Lincoln should be seen the next morning and he assured Cameron that Lincoln
                    would permit Cameron to antedate a letter of resignation and Lincoln write a
                    kind acceptance. Scott saw the President early next morning, and Lincoln readily
                    agreed to Scott's suggestion, resulting in the withdrawal of the original letter
                    from Lincoln to Cameron and the substitution of the correspondence embracing
                    Cameron's formal resignation and Lincoln's formal and very kind acceptance.
                    Stanton had no knowledge that he was considered for the Cabinet until he was
                    notified that his nomination had been sent to the Senate for the Secretaryship
                    of War, nor did any member of the Cabinet know of the changes made. Even  Chase, who delivered the letter to Cameron, had no knowledge of its
                    contents.</p>
<p>It is only just to Cameron to say that when a resolution of censure on his
                    administration of the War Department was adopted by a Republican House,
                    President Lincoln sent a brief special message to the House stating that the
                    censure of Cameron was not wholly just, as in many things for which he was
                    censured the President himself was equally responsible, and a few years later
                    the resolution of censure was rescinded by the House and expunged from its
                    record.</p>
<p>While the relations between Cameron and Lincoln were somewhat strained by
                    Lincoln's method of retiring Cameron from the Cabinet, Cameron did not hesitate
                    to take advantage of the opportunity presented in the early part of 1864 to
                    throw himself into the breach and become the ostensible leader of the movement
                    to sustain Lincoln in Pennsylvania. The action of the Legislature that was
                    inspired by Cameron, brought out a very hearty and generally cordial response
                    from the Republicans of the State in favor of Lincoln, and from that time until
                    the meeting of the State Convention there was practically no Lincoln issue in
                    the Republican politics of the State. I was then enjoying at home a season of
                    relief from public care, and trying to give some attention to private affairs.
                    My devotion to Lincoln made me desirous to go as a delegate to the National
                    Convention from my own congressional district, and I was chosen by the unanimous
                    action of the different countries without the formality of a conference. A few
                    weeks before the meeting of the convention the President telegraphed me to come
                    to Washington, and notwithstanding the fact that at that time more than a
                    majority of all the delegaes to the National
                    Convention were positively instructed to him, without serious opposition to him
                    in any of the States, I was surprised to find Lincoln apprehensive that he might
                    not be renominated. He knew that a considerable number of very able men were
                    earnestly against him and when I told him that it was not possible to be
                    defeated with a majority of the delegates instructed for him, and nearly all of
                    the remainder pledged to him, his answer was: "But I don't forget that I was
                    nominated for President in a convention that was two-thirds for the other
                    fellow."</p>
<p>He surprised me by saying that he had sent for me for the purpose of having me
                    made one of the delegates-at-large from Pennsylvania. Considering that I was
                    already a member of the delegation, in which a man's usefulness was measured
                    entirely by his ability and influence and not by the distinction of a
                    delegate-at-large over a district delegate, I could not but regard the
                    proposition as absurd, besides being, as I then believed it to be, entirely
                    impossible. I told the President that I could not, with any decency, appeal to
                    the State Convention to elect me a delegate-at-large when I was already
                    unanimously chosen a delegate from my district; but Lincoln was persistent to an
                    extent that I could not understand and I finally asked him what he meant by
                    asking me to do so ungracious and, to my mind, impossible thing. He informed me
                    that he had a letter from General Cameron who said he would be a
                    delegate-at-large from Pennsylvania, and he added that while he had no question
                    of Cameron's fidelity, he thought that it was most desirable that if Cameron was
                    a delegate-at-large I should be one with him. He was most importunate on the
                    subject, and finally said: "I think you can accomplish it, and I want you to
                    try." I told him that if opportunity offered I would accomplish it, but that I
                    had not the remotest idea that it was within the range of possibility.</p>
<p>I knew enough of Lincoln at that time, to know that he had a settled purpose in
                    view, but what it was I could not conceive, nor would he explain. He knew that
                    my election as delegate-at-large could not, in any way, influence the action of
                    Cameron, but he made it a command and I told him that I would see if it could be
                    accomplished. On my return from Washington I stopped over at Harrisburg without
                    any definite purpose, and dropped in to see George Bergner who, while a warm
                    personal friend of mine, was a devoted follower of Cameron. Cameron was anxious
                    to be a delegate-at-large and could not have been defeated, but his desire was
                    to be elected by an overwhelming vote, and he knew that that could be
                    accomplished only by the concurrence of the Curtin people. After a few minutes'
                    conversation with Bergner he remarked that we were now all for Lincoln, and
                    there ought not to be any division in the party at the next State Convention;
                    that there was no State ticket to nominate and only electors and
                    delegates-at-large to be chosen. He then broke the ice by stating that "the old
                    man," meaning Cameron, wanted to be a delegate-at-large and hoped there would be
                    harmony it his selection. For the first time I saw the glimpse of an opening to
                    accomplish what I had been instructed to do, and I answered Bergner by saying
                    that certainly there should be no division in the convention as we were all for
                    Lincoln, and that Cameron and Curtin should be made delegates-at-large by a
                    unanimous vote. I knew that Cameron would object to Curtin as they were not on
                    speaking terms, and Bergner promptly answered that "the old man" and Curtin
                    couldn't get along together, but he added: "We'll take you and Cameron." I asked
                    him what assurance he had that Cameron would assent to the arrangement and he
                    informed me that if I would wait twenty minutes he would see Cameron in person
                    and bring he his assurance. He was delighted, of course, at the prospect of
                    getting Cameron the support of the Curtin element....</p>
<p>... there are yet enough living in Pennsylvania to establish the fact that
                    Lincoln nominated Johnson over Hamlin for Vice-President in 1864, outside my own
                    testimony. Mr. Armstrong was with Cameron on his mission to Butler, sent by
                    Lincoln to arrange for the nomination of a War Democrat. Judge Stewart, who
                    succeeded me as district delegate, and knew all that transpired at Baltimore, is
                    also cognizant of the fact that both Cameron and myself obeyed Lincoln in the
                    matter. Ex-Congressman J. Rankin Young, still living in Philadelphia, some years
                    after the war, prepared an interview with General Cameron on the subject that
                    was carefully revised by Cameron himself, and published in the New York
                    "Herald," telling how he had co-operated with Lincoln in the early part of the
                    year in a movement for the nomination of Johnson.</p>
<p>Lincoln was nominated on the first ballot, receiving the full vote of every State
                    but Missouri, whose delegation was instructed for Grant, but it promptly changed
                    to Lincoln before the vote was announced, making his nomination unanimous. On
                    the roll call for Vice-President, Johnson received 200 votes, Hamlin 150,
                    Dickinson 108 with 61 scattering, but before the vote was announced Pennsylvania
                    changed from Hamlin to Johnson and other changes followed rapidly, making the
                    final announcement of the first ballot 494 for Johnson, 17 for Dickinson and 9
                    for Hamlin.</p>
<p>Lincoln was not influenced by prejudice or resentment in opposing the nomination
                    of Hamlin. The reasons he gave me in support of the nomination of Johnson were
                    so logical and conclusive that I would have voted for Johnson as a matter of
                    duty to the party and to the country, regardless of my willingness to accede to
                    the wishes of the President. They were: First, that the nomination and election
                    of a Vice-President from a reconstructed State in the heart of the Confederacy,
                    who was a distinctly representative man, and had filled every office in the gift
                    of the State, would add more strength to the friends of the Union in England and
                    France, who were struggling against the recognition of the Confederacy, than
                    could be accomplished in any other way, save by the complete overthrow of the
                    Confederate military power. Second, the strong political necessity for
                    nominating a distinctive War Democrat not then connected to the Republican party
                    , to bring to the support of the Administration the many thousands of War
                    Democrats who were followers of men like Johnson, Dickinson, Butler, Dix, Holt
                    and others; and, third, the nomination of Johnson would desectionalize the
                    Republican party. Recognition of the Confederacy was yet a fearful peril to the
                    Union cause, and the nomination of Johnson demonstrated that substantial
                    progress was being made in the restoration of the Union by the accomplished
                    reconstruction of the State in the inner circle of rebellion.</p>
<p>The convention met in Baltimore on the 7th of June, and I never saw a more hearty
                    welcome given to any man in a public assembly than was given the Rev. Robert J. Breckenridge, of Kentucky, when he
                    was made temporary president of the body. It was a brave act for any man for any
                    man from the South to confess himself a Republican, but when a man of the high
                    character and intellectual and moral attitude of Dr.
                    Breckinridge took the chair in the Republican National Convention, it gave
                    courage and hope to scores of thousands in the Southern States. Governor
                    Dennison of Ohio, was made permanent president, but the controlling mind of the
                    convention was that of  Henry J. Raymond, who acted in closest
                    confidence with Lincoln. He not only withdrew his State from the support of
                    Hamlin, but was compelled to sacrifice Dickinson, another War Democrat, whose
                    friends felt that he should be preferred to Johnson. He wrote the platform,
                    became chairman of the National Committee, wrote the campaign life of Lincoln,
                    and he was, in fact, the "leader of leaders" of that great contest.</p>
<p>There were many inharmonious elements in the convention. All felt that we were
                    then approaching the period when the military power of the Confederacy would be
                    overthrown, and the grave problem of reconstruction would be presented for
                    solution. On that question there could have been no common ground of agreement
                    in the National Convention of 1864. There were many who, like Stevens, demanded
                    the severest punishment of the officials who engaged in rebellion, the
                    confiscation of property, and the absolute denial of citizenship, while a
                    majority were in favor of various shades of generous methods to accomplish
                    reconciliation and reunion. While there was a general feeling of confidence in
                    the re-election of Lincoln, the more intelligent of the leaders knew that they
                    had a severe battle before them and most careful methods were developed to guard
                    against disaster in November.</p>
<p>It was known that General McClellan would be the opposing candidate; that he had
                    many sincere supporters in the army and that the conservative elements of the
                    country had absolute confidence in him, while all the shades of the entire
                    anti-war elements would be certain to support any candidate nominated by the
                    Democrats. The Republican leaders did not assume that their victory was assured,
                    and many grave conferences were held on the various subjects which might have a
                    bearing on the conflict. It was a convention of great force, and it was most
                    judiciously guided by wise leadership to place the party in the best attiture for a desperate conflict. The student of
                    to-day, who looks over the history of that campaign will naturally assume that
                    Lincoln was re-elected without a struggle, as the vote appears to be
                    overwhelming; but all who were at the Baltimore convention, and all who actively
                    participated in the struggle, will remember the gloom that hung over the
                    Republican party during the Summer months, and how triumph was finally decided
                    by the victories of Sherman in Atlanta, and Sheridan in the valley.</p>
