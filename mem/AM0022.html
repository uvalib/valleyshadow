<h3 class="section-head">Augusta County: "Jacob Alexander Hanger," by Unknown, February 1916</h3>
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> An obituary of Jacob Alexander Hanger, a soldier in the 14th Virginia
                Cavalry.</p>
<p>Jacob Alexander Hanger died suddenly at his home, Edge Rock, near Staunton, Va., on February 17, 1916, at the age of seventy-six
                    years. Few men have led a more active or useful life. In 1861, with two brothers
                    and several cousins of the same name, he joined the Churchville Cavalry, which
                    afterwards became Company I, 14th Virginia Cavalry, and which won distinction
                    because of its gallantry. In 1862 he helped to organize the regimental band, of
                    which he and his brother George were members. This was the only band on the
                    Southern side which could play on horseback. The members often wished to join
                    the ranks, but their commander forbade them, as he could get no others to play
                    in the band.</p>
<p>Comrade Hanger also did scout duty and on one occasion avoided capture by a
                    clever ruse. Near Slaven's Cabins, on Cheat Mountain, he ordered his companions
                    to watch the enemy while he went to the village for provisions. In returning he
                    was passing a lonely place when about forty rifles of the enemy were pointed at
                    him. Dropping his bag of provisions, he exclaimed: "Why didn't you fellows wait?
                    I told you to wait. I'll go call the rest." Putting spurs to his horse, he
                    dashed off and escaped without pursuit.</p>
<p>After the war Mr. Hanger settled in Staunton, Va.,
                    and went into business. He was also a successful inventor. He was a deacon in
                    the Presbyterian Church for many years and a faithful Christian. He was married
                    to Miss Dawson and is survived by one son, Wythe, who was his companion and
                    comfort. He was buried in the cemetery at Churchville, Va.</p>
