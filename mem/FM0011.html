                            McClure, 1905</h3>
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> In this chapter of Old Time Notes of Pennsylvania,
                    McClure writes of the beginning battles of the Civil War, Fort Sumter and the
                    First Battle of Bull Run. McClure also describes McClellan's command of the
                    Union Army and Curtin's success as the "Soldiers' Friend."</p>
<p>THE bombardment of Sumter accomplished the enforced secession of Virginia and
                    North Carolina. The conventions of both of these States had previously refused
                    to join in the secession movement.</p>
<p>Looking merely on the surface of the history of those times, the firing on Sumter
                    appears as an act of midsummer madness, when General Beauregard, the Confederate
                    commander, had the assurance of Major Anderson, commanding the little handful of
                    the Union force in Sumter, that he would surrender the fort at noon two days
                    thereafter if not supplied with provisions. It was this firing upon a starving
                    garrison by order of the Confederate government that inflamed the North and gave
                    it substantial unanimity in support of the war, and it was, as I have on several
                    occasions stated, the death knell of the Confederacy.</p>
<p>In a conversation with Jefferson Davis, who was then President of the
                    Confederacy, when I visited his home  some ten years after the war,
                    I asked him whether political conditions had not controlled his decision to
                    order the firing upon Sumter when its surrender was assured at a given hour. He
                    declared very positively, however, that the order to fire upon Sumter had been
                    issued solely because the Federal government had, as he believed, been guilty of
                    a breach of faith by starting an expedition by sea to provision and reinforce
                    Sumter. I reminded him that there was no intention on the part of President
                    Lincoln to violate the faith of the government, as was evidenced by his
                    notification to Governor Pickens that an expedition had been started to
                    provision the garrison at Sumter, and with the notice the assurance was given
                    that if provisions were allowed to be supplied to the fort, no attempt would be
                    made to reinforce the garrison or supply munitions of war.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Davis may have been influenced by his belief that a breach of faith
                    had been committed by Lincoln. I cannot doubt that Sumter would not have been
                    fired upon but for the fact that Virginia and North Carolina could not be
                    brought into the Confederacy without first precipitating civil war. Immediately
                    after the surrender of Sumter and the call of the government for 75,000 troops
                    to maintain the Union, the reconvened convention of Virginia, in secret session,
                    adopted the ordinance of secession, and North Carolina followed. The Confederate
                    government at once transferred its Capital to Richmond, and all that Virginia
                    gained by reversing her verdict against secession, and making common cause with
                    the Confederacy, was to make her soil the chief theater of civil war, with
                    almost universal desolation within her borders.</p>
<p>Both sections immediately organized large armies. General Beauregard, who had
                    commanded the bombardment at Charleston, was placed at the head of one army, and
                    advanced to Mantissas, a good strategic  point because of its
                    railroad facilities, and General Joseph E. Johnson with another army took
                    possession of the Shenandoah Valley. An army of some 25,000 men was organized at
                    Washington to make the advance upon Manassas and Richmond, commanded by General
                    McDowell, and General Patterson, who was in command of the Department of
                    Pennsylvania, marched with an army of nearly equal numbers through the
                    Cumberland Valley to meet Johnson somewhere on the other side of the Potomac.</p>
<p>General Scott continued as commander-in-chief and personally directed the
                    movements of all the various military forces in the field, but he had outlived
                    his ability to exhibit the great military genius which made his march from Vera
                    Cruz to Mexico so lustrous in achievements, and his utter incapacity for his
                    high command was clearly illustrated when McDowell and Patterson, both moving
                    under his immediate orders, were kept far apart at the battle of Bull Run, while
                    Johnson escaped from Patterson, joined Beauregard, and changed a Union victory
                    into a most disastrous Union defeat.</p>
<p>The people of the North had become somewhat accustomed to the idea of civil war,
                    as immense preparations for it had been going on for nearly three months, but
                    nearly all cherished the hope that in some way, without knowing or pretending to
                    know how it might be accomplished, war would be averted, or at least that a
                    single battle would surely end the conflict and bring about the restoration of
                    the Union on some basis of compromise.</p>
<p>When General Patterson with his army was marching through the Cumberland Valley
                    to the Potomac, he encamped for several days on my farm on the outskirts of
                    Chambersburg, and I had the principal officers to dine with me during their
                    stay. Along with General  Patterson were General Cadwallader,
                    General Doubleday, General Keim, Colonel George H. Thomas, then commanding the
                    regulars, Major Fitz John Porter, who was on General Scott's staff and
                    represented the commander-in-chief, and Senator John Sherman, who was a
                    volunteer aide on Patterson's staff. It was a pleasant May evening, and after
                    dinner the parties were enjoying their cigars on the porch, where I heard the
                    whole question of the war freely discussed by the officers and the men whom I
                    supposed to be unerring oracles on the grave question.</p>
<p>The only silent guest of the occasion was Colonel Thomas. He was a Virginian and
                    well knew how terribly the South was in earnest, and how desperately its people
                    would fight for their homes, and only very few questions were asked him at any
                    time during the conversation, to which he always answered very courteously and
                    without expressing any decided opinion. All of the others, with the single
                    exception of Doubleday, agreed that it might be necessary to fight one general
                    battle, but beyond that the war could not possibly be extended. They assumed
                    that the North with its advantage in numbers would be successful in the battle,
                    and that compromise and peace must inevitably follow. General Doubleday, who had
                    been in Sumter, and had been in immediate intercourse with the Southern people,
                    declared with great earnestness that if one general battle was fought between
                    the North and the South, it would precipitate the bloodiest war of the century.</p>
<p>Generals Patterson, Cadwallader, Keim, and Staff Officers Porter and Sherman were
                    entirely agreed in the conviction that one battle might be necessary for peace,
                    but that peace must follow the first defeat of the Southern army. They regarded
                    the capture of Richmond as certain to follow a successful battle in the  field, and they believed that peace would come before the
                    Confederate Capital could be captured. Doubleday very earnestly combatted the
                    delusion of his fellow-officers. He was an impetuous man and expressed his views
                    with unusual earnestness. He was called away to his command before any of the
                    others left, and when he had gone out of hearing, General Patterson remarked
                    that it was very unfortunate for Doubleday that he was a spiritualist and "gone
                    in the head."</p>
<p>Both sections were unprepared for war, but the South had the advantage of the
                    transfer of the major portion of the arms of the Union to the Southern arsenals
                    before the war began, by Secretary Floyd, of Virginia. The country had not been
                    engaged in war for half a century with the exception of a short struggle with
                    Mexico that did not require so much as a regiment from each State of the Union,
                    and the martial spirit of the people had almost entirely died out.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania offered enough troops to fill the entire call of the government for
                    75,000 men, and with her Reserve Corps that was in an advanced stage of
                    organization when the battle of Bull Run was fought, we had a very large excess
                    of our quota of men in the military service. No one in the North doubted that
                    with the overwhelming numbers under Scott's command the battle to be fought at
                    Manassas must be a decided victory for the Union army, and the belief was very
                    general that within a week or two at the most after such a battle, Richmond
                    would be in the possession of Union troops.</p>
<p>Public sentiment was intensely inflamed on the subject of the war, and the cry of
                    "On to Richmond," started in Greeley's "Tribune," was repeated in every
                    community.</p>
<p>Why the battle of Bull Run was lost has never been officially explained to the
                    public. General Patterson,  who was severely censured at the time
                    for permitting Johnson to escape from the valley and join Beauregard at Bull
                    Run, promptly demanded a court of inquiry at which he proposed to prove beyond
                    dispute that he had literally and faithfully obeyed the orders of General Scott,
                    and in that he was undoubtedly right. The court of inquiry was refused to him
                    because, as the Department declared, it was not necessary for his vindication.</p>
<p>When McDowell's army was defeated and finally driven in utter confusion back into
                    the defenses of Washington, the people of the North, and especially of
                    Pennsylvania, for the first time began to understand the magnitude of
                    undertaking to lock horns with the South to conquer its people into submission
                    to the Union.</p>
<p>At first a tidal wave of despair swept over the North, but it was speedily
                    dispelled as the people began to understand the duties and sacrifices they must
                    accept. I then represented the Gettysburg district in the State senate, and was
                    engaged nearly all the time with Governor Curtin at Harrisburg. He stood out
                    before the State and the country as grandly vindicated by organizing the
                    Pennsylvania Reserve Corps in the face of the protest of the National
                    government, as it was that corps, enlisted for three years' service or during
                    the war, that was the nucleus of the Grand Army of the Potomac that McClellan so
                    completely organized after he was called into command.</p>
<p>The Governor gave prompt utterance to his patriotic convictions and purposes and
                    inspired the loyal sentiment of the State to aggressive action. It was then
                    known that we were face to face with actual sanguinary war between brethren of
                    opposing sections, and all understood that such a war must be even more
                    desperate than a war between opposing nationalities.  McClellan was
                    called to the command of the Army of the Potomac, as he then stood alone with a
                    record of victories in West Virginia, which a few years later would hardly have
                    been regarded as skirmishes, but he had defeated or captured several regimental
                    commands at different points, and as he was known to be one of the most
                    accomplished officers in the army, it was natural, with his prestige of
                    victories in West Virginia, that he should be called to the command of the Army
                    of the Potomac with the very cordial approval of the country.</p>
<p>One of the amusing features of the early part of the war was the hesitation of
                    the government to recognize a condition of war in the South and treat the
                    Confederacy as a belligerent power. When General McClellan demanded the
                    surrender of Colonel Pegram's regiment in West Virginia, he addressed Pegram as
                    if writing a business note, entirely omitting Pegram's title, and General Andrew
                    Porter, a gallant Pennsylvania soldier, and cousin of Horace Porter, who was on
                    Grant's staff and is now Minister to France, informed me of the ludicrous scene
                    when the first flag of truce appeared between the two armies. General Porter was
                    provost marshal of the army, and when information came from the pickets that a
                    Southern command had appeared with a flag of truce, it was brought to him, and
                    the grave question of acknowledging the Confederacy as a belligerent power had
                    to be decided at once. There was great hesitation about the attitude to be
                    assumed, but it was finally decided that any communication from the Southern
                    army should be received without any official recognition of her belligerent
                    rights. The communication related simply to the exchange of some prisoners, and
                    arrangements were made to carry into effect the request that was made, but with
                    scrupulous care to avoid any official recognition as belligerents.</p>
<p>France and England had already recognized the rights of the Confederacy as a
                    belligerent, and we could do nothing less without deciding that there should be
                    neither capture nor exchange of prisoners, leaving the war to be conducted under
                    the old-time laws of barbarism. The protection of the Union prisoners in the
                    hands of the enemy compelled the government to treat with the Confederacy as
                    possessing all the rights of a belligerent power, while we were very careful to
                    avoid any form of distinct recognition. A regular cartel for the exchange of
                    prisoners was agreed upon, and every belligerent right practically accorded to
                    the South simply because it was an imperious necessity.</p>
<p>It was confidently expected that General McClellan, with the new Army of the
                    Potomac, that very largely outnumbered the Confederate force between Washington
                    and Richmond, would march upon Manassas in the early fall, and the belief was
                    generally shared in the North that he would be in Richmond by the 1st of
                    October. But McClellan was, first of all, a thorough disciplinarian, and he was
                    unwilling to advance upon the enemy until he had his army thoroughly
                    disciplined, and September passed and finally October passed with the Army of
                    the Potomac remaining at Washington, and there was profound disappointment
                    throughout the entire North.</p>
<p>The fall elections, the most important of which were held in October, were
                    seriously affected by the inaction of the Union army, and political interests as
                    well as patriotic impulses demanded the advance of the Army of the Potomac.
                    Fortunately, there were no State officers to be elected in Pennsylvania, but the
                    Republicans would have lost the control of the popular branch of the Legislature
                    had it not been for a combination made by which a number of War Demo-crats were elected to the House by the support of the Republicans.</p>
<p>Governor Curtin visited Washington certainly half a dozen times during the fall
                    of 1861 to urge the vigorous prosecution of the war. President Lincoln and War
                    Secretary Cameron both shared Cumin's anxiety, and, although the weather was
                    unusually favorable throughout the fall for army movements, with excellent
                    roads, the Army of the Potomac remained in its Washington camp until midwinter,
                    when McClellan suffered a severe attack of illness, and the President assumed
                    the responsibility of ordering a general advance of the army on the 22d of
                    February, 1862. That order was withdrawn when the President reluctantly yielded
                    to General McClellan's assurances that the advance would be made at an early
                    day. Finally the movement was made upon Manassas, which was found deserted by
                    the Confederate forces, with the defences mounted
                    with wooden imitation guns.</p>
<p>Governor Curtin inaugurated his wonderful system for the care of the Pennsylvania
                    soldiers in the field and in the hospitals early in the fall of 1861. He
                    appointed commissioners representing the State to visit soldiers in the field,
                    and especially sick and wounded in the hospitals, and see that they had every
                    necessary provision for their comfort. I have stated in a former chapter that
                    every Pennsylvania soldier who addressed a letter on any subject, however
                    trivial, received a direct answer from the Executive chamber over the name of
                    the Governor, and he was entirely in advance of all the Northern executives in
                    making provision for the care of our State troops. He carried that theory to the
                    extent of early legislation providing for the body of every Pennsylvania soldier
                    who died on the field, in a hospital, or anywhere in the military service, to be
                    brought home at the expense of the State for burial with his kindred.  Curtin's affection for his soldiers was that of the most loving
                    father for his own children. A man clad in his country's blue, although without
                    insignia of command, always was the first of the visitors admitted into the
                    Executive chamber. It soon became well understood throughout the Pennsylvania
                    portion of the army that Governor Curtin was the "Soldiers' Friend," and by that
                    title he was known not only to every Pennsylvanian in the service, but in the
                    home of every soldier in the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>No matter how grave or exacting were his official duties, the presence of a
                    soldier, however humble, always received welcome and attention, and it was the
                    grateful appreciation of this devotion of Curtin to the Pennsylvania soldiers
                    that re-elected him in 1863, when some 70,000 Pennsylvania soldiers were not
                    permitted to vote for Governor, as the amendment to our Constitution permitting
                    soldiers to vote in the field was not accomplished until 1864. The soldiers
                    could not vote for Curtin's re-election themselves, but earnest appeals came to
                    the home of nearly every soldier of the State urging fathers, brothers and
                    friends to support the Soldiers' Friend for re-election, and thus, while
                    Pennsylvania troops were disfranchised, it is quite probable that they exerted
                    even a greater influence upon the election, by bringing Democratic relatives and
                    friends to the support of Curtin, than if they had been permitted to vote
                    themselves.</p>
<p>If a despatch or a letter came to the Governor, even
                    from the most distant section of the Union, telling the story of a sick or
                    wounded soldier who needed attention, it was the first matter to be disposed of,
                    and always in favor of the soldier to the uttermost.</p>
<p>I was one of the party that accompanied him when he delivered the State flags to
                    the Pennsylvania Reserves at Tennallytown, in the presence of President  Lincoln, General McClellan, Secretary Cameron and a host of other
                    dignitaries, and the affection exhibited by the soldiers, officers and privates,
                    as he gave them their State standards, and expressed his entire confidence that
                    they would bring them back with honor, was one of the most beautiful spectacles
                    I ever witnessed. When he had completed his work, passing from regiment to
                    regiment and handing each the standard of the State, he was quite overcome as
                    the last flag passed into the hands of the commander of a regiment. With
                    quivering lips and tear-dimmed eyes he raised his hand and said: "God bless you
                    and preserve the flag."</p>
<p>After the flags had been delivered, a ceremony that was witnessed by a
                    considerable portion of the army, a party consisting of eight or ten, headed by
                    McClellan and Lincoln, rode around the entire army of the Potomac on horseback,
                    a journey that occupied more than half the day. The only important feature of
                    that ride, as I recall it, was the incident of McClellan stopping the entire
                    party at one point and calling Mr. Lincoln's attention to the fact that they
                    were for the first time outside of the Union lines, that is, beyond the Union
                    pickets, although the Union picket line was not far in our rear. President
                    Lincoln answered in his quaint way, that he thought it would be a very good
                    place to leave, in which the entire party, including General McClellan, heartily
                    concurred.</p>
<p>Curtin did not leave a single Pennsylvania regiment unvisited on that occasion,
                    and I well remember the satisfaction that all felt the evening after the work of
                    the day and the journey had been accomplished, because of the superb
                    organization of the Army of the Potomac by McClellan, which, as we believed,
                    would capture Richmond before the frosts of autumn came again. How sadly all
                    were disappointed is a story too well known to all to need repetition.</p>
