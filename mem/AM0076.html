                            Unknown, 1920</h3>
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> Celebratory account of unveiling of Richmond's Stonewall Jackson monument;
                    includes historical sketch of previous unveilings of Jackson monuments</p>
<p>After more than half a century from the time Stonewall Jackson fell at
                    Chancellorsville, a great memorial has been erected in his honor at Richmond,
                        Va., the combined tribute of his native State
                    and the whole South. This handsome equestrian monument was unveiled on the 11th
                    of October, 1919, and of those who had served on the staff of the great
                    commander only one was left to take part in its dedication. It stands at the
                    intersection of Monument Avenue and the Boulevard in this beautiful Southern
                    city, and the bronze figure of rider and horse rises to a height of seventeen
                    feet over the base. It is the work of F. William Sievers, who also made the
                    Virginia Memorial at Gettysburg, the magnificent equestrian statue of General
                    Lee.</p>
<p>The monument represents a total cost of approximately $40,000, of which $10,000
                    was appropriated by the legislature of Virginia, $10,000 was given by the city
                    of Richmond, and $5,000 was raised by the sale of Confederate flags by a
                    committee of the Richmond ladies. The remainder represents individual
                    contributions from all over the South. The Daughters of the Confederacy have
                    everywhere assisted actively in securing contributions and arousing interest in
                    this memorial.</p>
<p>The unveiling exercises were presided over by Capt.
                    James Power Smith, the sole survivor of Jackson's staff, and little Anna Jackson
                    Preston unveiled the bronze statue of her great-grandfather, assisted by the
                    little son of the sculptor. The orator of the day was Col. Robert E. Lee, grandson of Gen. R. E.
                    Lee. In the parade as escort of honor, was the corps of cadets from the Virginia
                    Military Institute, in which Jackson was instructor before going into the
                    Confederate army. Representatives of the leading families of the Old Dominion
                    and other States had prominent places in this parade, and many military
                    companies of the State and city gave that feature of distinction to the pageant.</p>
<p>THE JACKSON MEMORIAL.</p>
<p>A historical sketch of the various monuments to Stonewall Jackson and the
                    occasion of their erection, with an account of the Stonewall Jackson Monument
                    Corporation and its work in the erection of the equestrian memorial in Richmond,
                    was prepared by the Rev. James Power Smith,
                    President of the Monument Corporation and sole survivor of Jackson's staff, and
                    was read by him as a part of the unveiling exercises. It is here given:</p>
<p>"When Gen. Thomas J. Jackson fell at
                    Chancellorsville, to the men from all the Confederate States, whom he had won to
                    a profound and undying devotion, there seemed nothing they could do too great to
                    show their admiration, their confidence, and their love. Throughout the
                    Southland there was the thought and the purpose to remember their great leader
                    and perpetuate his memory in some enduring form.</p>
<p>"Dramatic and memorable was the meeting of the Stonewall Brigade on the field of
                    Spotsylvania, after Chancellorsville, when resolutions were adopted with bowed
                    heads and deep emotion pledging themselves to erect a monument which would
                    testify to their love and perpetuate his memory to generations to come. But when
                    at last the war was ended, those men who survived went back to immediate and
                    universal industry to feed and clothe an impoverished people.</p>
<p>"In 1875 there came across the seas the gift to Virginia of English gentlemen,
                    led by Mr. Beresford-Hope, the splendid portrait statue of Stonewall Jackson
                    which stands in our Capitol Square. It was received by Governor Kemper for
                    Virginia, and the statue was unveiled October 26, 1875, and the oration
                    delivered by the Rev. Moses D. Hoge, D.D. That statue has given a profound
                    satisfaction to our people.</p>
<p>"An association was formed at Fredericksburg to erect a memorial on the spot
                    where Jackson fell. It was designed by Col. W. E.
                    Cutshaw and built of Virginia granite cut for the Richmond City Hall. It was
                    unveiled and dedicated June 13, 1888, with an oration by John Warwick Daniel,
                    soldier and Senator.</p>
<p>"In 1891 the noble statue of Jackson by Edward V. Valentine over Jackson's grave
                    in Lexington was unveiled, when the orator was Gen.
                    Jubal A. Early. And later a statue of Jackson from the skill of Sir Moses
                    Ezekiel was erected in the Capitol Square at Charleston, W. Va., and a replica was given  by
                    Sir Moses himself to the Virginia Military Institute, Lexington, Va.</p>
<p>"There was still the widely prevailing sentiment that Virginia and her sister
                    States had not yet accomplished that which it was in their hearts to do, to
                    erect an equestrian monument to Jackson, our own memorial and our gift to
                    generations after us.</p>
<p>"Again and again the desire found expression in published letters, in appeals to
                    the legislature, and in public orations. Men from all sections and from other
                    lands asked: `Where is your monument to Stonewall Jackson?'</p>
<p>"At last, in 1911, a circular letter was sent out calling a meeting of those
                    interested. The call emanated from Capt. W. M.
                    Myers and the officers and men of the Richmond Howitzers. The first meeting was
                    held November 29, 1911, in Lee Camp Hall, with the Mayor of the city, Hon. D. C. Richardson, in the chair. The first
                    contribution came from W. H. McCarthy, of the Veteran Howitzer Association.
                    Organization was effected and officers elected, with a board of directors, as
                    follows: Officers-James Power Smith, President; Judge George L. Christian, First
                    Vice President; Mrs. Edgar D. Taylor, Second Vice President; W. Witcher Keen,
                    Third Vice President; Capt. William M. Myers,
                    Secretary (who, entering the military service of the country, was succeeded by
                        Col. W. S. Archer); E. D. Hotchkiss, Treasurer.
                        Directors-Col. W. S. Archer, Maj. W. A. Anderson, Capt.
                    J. Thompson Brown, the Hon. D. C. Richardson,
                    Mrs. Norman V. Randolph, Mrs. Charles E. Bolling, Miss Anna B. Boykin, Miss Kate
                    Mason Rowland, Maj. T. M. Wortham, Edwin P. Cox,
                        Gen. W. W. Sale, Col. John S. Harwood. To the board there were added later Gen. C. J. Anderson, Gen. Jo Lane Stern, T. Peyton Giles, Capt.
                    John Lamb, John Stewart Bryan, Edgar D. Taylor, and Mrs. B. A. Blenner. During
                    our seven years of service we have mourned the removal by death of three
                    valuable and honored members, Mrs. Edgar Taylor, the Second Vice President, Miss
                    Kate Mason Rowland, and Col. John S. Harwood.</p>
<p>"On the evening of April 29, 1914, a great public assembly filled the city
                    auditorium, organized and conducted by Mrs. G. T. W. Kern, Historian of the
                    Richmond Chater, U. D. C., Gov. Henry Carter Stuart presiding, and the meeting
                    was addressed by the Hon. A. J. Montague, Dr. S. C. Mitchell, John Stewart Bryan, and the
                    President of the Jackson Monument Corporation. This great meeting was notably
                    graced by the presence of the venerable widow of our hero, Mrs. Mary Anna
                    Jackson.</p>
<p>"Following this, on May 1, 1914, came the Jackson Flag Day, when the ladies of
                    the United Daughters of the Confederacy, with splendid organization and
                    indomitable spirit, brought about $5,000 into our treasury.</p>
<p>"The site, corner of Monument Avenue and the Boulevard, was determined on
                    November 30, 1914, and the corner stone was laid June 3, 1915, with an
                    appropriate address by the Hon. William A.
                    Anderson, of Lexington, Va.</p>
<p>"The Association and the people of Virginia are indebted to Mrs. N. V. Randolph
                    and the Richmond Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy; to Mrs. A.
                    A. Campbell and the Virginia Division of the United Daughters of the
                    Confederacy; to Mrs. G. T. W. Kern for the great memorial meeting in the
                    auditorium and the large success of the Jackson monument flag day; to Mr. E. D.
                    Hotchkiss, our Treasurer, for the watchful care and the increase of funds; to
                    the Hon. Henry Carter Stuart, Governor of
                    Virginia, the legislature of the State, the Council and the Board of Aldermen of
                    the city of Richmond, and to Col. Barton H. Grundy,
                    of the Finance Committee; to the unfailing devotion to the cause of all the
                    members of the Board and to F. William Sievers, our gifted sculptor, who has won
                    for himself a lasting fame. And now to the State of Virginia, to the city of
                    Richmond, to the people of all our Southland, and to the sons and daughters of
                    all Confederates with profound and grateful satisfaction we present our
                    completed work."</p>
