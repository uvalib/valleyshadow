            <div1 type="article" id="d5">
                <p>At a recent meeting of Stonewall Jackson Camp Confederate Veterans the following
                    admirable paper on the life of the late Major Hotchkiss, was adopted and ordered
                    spread upon the minutes.</p>
                <p>Comrade Jed Hotchkiss has gone to join the silent majority. Many resolutions,
                    adoped by other bodies with which he was identified, have told the story of his
                    well spent life. For right well had our friend rounded out the measure of his
                    three score years and ten.</p>
                <p>In adding its tribute to his memory this camp has mainly to do with his valuable
                    military service, his loyalty of devotion, unshaken by defeat, to the cause and
                    the people of the Confederate States, his strong attachment to the camp, of
                    which he may well be called the founder, his untiring zeal for its advancement,
                    his fidelity of comradeship in our personal intercourse, and his sturdy
                    vindication, always and everywhere, of the truth and principles which animated
                    the Southern volunteer soldier in the mighty struggle of 1861 65.</p>
                <p>Hotchkiss is gone from us, but his work lives after him. It was for others rather
                    than himself. What he has done for Virginia cannot be told in resolutions. Nor
                    can we do justice to the man in a few passing sentences.</p>
                <p>The multitude attending the beautiful and touching service, which fitly closed
                    his well spent life, bore testimony that the community mourned his loss as a
                    citizen. It was a loss as well to his country and his generation, for he was a
                    greater man than we recognized him to be when he walked among us, and the future
                    will better judge him. In war and in peace few men of his day have done more
                    work or better to the purpose. He was the very genius of labor and impersonation
                    of energy. A student of books always, a toiler by night and by day, he was also
                    a student of nature, of men and affairs and equally at home in many provinces of
                    science. Able as he was he took all truth for his province. His mind was a
                    treasure house of information, and in his special field of engineering, he was
                    an accomplished scholar, historian, public speaker, writer and teacher. And
                    familiar as he was with the processes and the mighty forces of nature, all such
                    knowledge served with him to confirm his faith in his religion. He was "a
                    faithful soldier and servant of Christ unto his life's end," and as men serve
                    here and go hence, we believe he has gone to his reward.</p>
                <p>As we followed him to his resting place in Thornrose Cemetery, which he had done
                    so much to beautify, we felt that every member of this camp had lost a friend in
                    him, "by his adoption tried." His interest in and fidelity to this organization
                    was only the expression of his unfailing faith in the principles for which we
                    took the field in 1861. With him it was the conviction born of intelligent study
                    of the conditions in the South, from the standpoint of an unbiased Northern man.
                    In none but a righteous cause could one with his antecedents and environments
                    have become so pronounced in his opinions. Self reliant as his great leader
                    himself, frank, open, decided in every conviction, every inch a man, he stood an
                    argument, and an intelligent argument, for the justice of the Southern cause,
                    ready at all times and in all places to give a reason for the faith that was in
                    him, and presenting, as occasion offered, in the <orig reg="centers">centres
                    </orig>of education and influence throughout the North, and before leading men
                    and learned societies abroad, (for his reputation was more than national), the
                    facts about this section as we know them and would have them known. And for this
                    he had exceptional opportunities as a lecturer before scientific bodies and
                    institutions of learning, and as a prominent member of the American Society,
                    (founded by Benjamin Franklin), of the Scotch-Irish Society, of the Southern
                    Historical Society, of the American Association for the Advancement of Science,
                    of the Society or Mining Engineers, of the Geographical and Geological
                    Societies, as Commissioner at the Columbian Exposition and that at New Orleans,
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Being one of the charter members of this <orig reg="camp">camy</orig>, it
                    happened that the army record of Comrade Hotchkiss is not on file. It is,
                    however, sufficiently well known to be stated as follows:</p>
                <p>The commencement of hostilities in 1861 found him a resident of Augusta county,
                    conducting the Loch Willow School near Churchville, one of the two high schools
                    for young men founded by him, the other being known as Mossy Creek Academy. He
                    had devoted himself to this work upon coming to Virginia twelve years previously
                    from native State, New York, and with marked success. He was of an old English
                    family, first settled at New Haven, <abbr expan="Connecticut">Conn.</abbr>,
                    about 1641, and of Revolutionary stock, Captain Gideon Hotchkiss, his ancestor,
                    having served in the French war as well as in the Continental Line.</p>
                <p>In the fourteen companies which took the field from this county prior to the
                    close of his session (last of June) were many of his pupils, his assistant,
                    Oswald Grinnan, taking command of one. And no sooner had its termination freed
                    him from this duty than he hastened to the front, taking with him his outfit for
                    surveying and map making, and riding 120 miles to join <abbr expan="General"
                        >Gen.</abbr> Garnett, then opposing <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr>
                    McClellan at Laurel Hill, a region with the topography of which, as indeed of
                    Virginia generally, he had familiarized himself. And he proved himself a friend
                    in need. In the record of the Field and Staff Officers of the Confederate States
                    Army he is mentioned as engineer to <abbr expan="Lieutenant Colonel">Lt.
                    Col.</abbr> J. M. Heck, July 14, 1861; <abbr expan="Captain">Capt</abbr><abbr
                        expan="Executive Officer?">E. O.</abbr> to <abbr expan="Lieutenant General"
                        >Lt. Gen.</abbr> R. S. Ewell, July, 1863; <abbr expan="Captain"
                        >Capt.</abbr><abbr expan="Topographical Engineer">Top. Eng.</abbr> 2nd Corps
                    Army of Valley district, 1864. Thus faintly appears the important part he played
                    in the drama of war on the fields of Virginia. To his knowledge of the country,
                    to his bold and quiet <orig reg="reconnaissance">reconnoisancy</orig>, to his
                    celerity and skill in drafting military maps, to his presence when intelligence
                    or direction in the line of his work was needed, and to the skill and
                    promptitude with which he executed important orders, we believe was due, to a
                    large extent, the successes achieved by our troops in the Shenandoah Valley and
                    some of those in Eastern Virginia. His first experience, the conduct of the
                    retreat of those of Garnett's men who came through from Rich Mountain in single
                    file over seven mountain ranges, was as difficult as it was creditable, and
                    arriving at Monterey he was assigned for the time as adjutant to Heck's
                    regiment. <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Lee recognized the services he had
                    rendered in this emergency, and assigned to him the preparation of maps upon
                    which he based his movements against Rosecrans. In March, 1862, he was called to
                    Woodstock by a brief but comprehensive order from <abbr expan="General"
                    >Gen.</abbr> T. J. Jackson: "Prepare a complete map of the Valley showing every
                    point of <orig reg="offense">offence</orig> and <orig reg="defense"
                    >defence</orig>, from the Potomac to Lexington."</p>
                <p>Adopting upon this work he utilized afterwards a system of sketching rapidly on
                    horseback in his note book the topographical features of the country, to be
                    developed in shape of maps at night in camp.</p>
                <p>When Jackson attacked Shields at Kernstown, he entrusted to Hotchkiss the
                    selection of a line of <orig reg="defense">defence</orig>, for which he chose
                    Stony Creek at Edinburg, a position held from the 1st to the 19th of April. Upon
                    the retreat and in reconnoitering for the attack upon Banks, with the
                    Massanuttan as a post, Hotchkiss established a code of signals most useful at
                    the time. In the advance against Milroy and return to the Valley, not only in
                    map making but in directing skirmishes, locating artillery, selecting roads, and
                    blockading mountain passes between the forces of Fremont and Banks, he rendered
                    yeoman service. For his reward he rode with Jackson through the streets of
                    Winchester, on the memorable 25th of May, 1862.</p>
                <p>He led the movement of Taylor's brigade to flank the Federal left at Port
                    Republic. Later he was assigned for the preparation of much needed military maps
                    for the use of the corps and division commanders, especially covering the routes
                    to Washington. He was in the engagement at Chantilly, was occupied in
                    constructing and destroying bridges, and guided <abbr expan="General"
                    >Gen.</abbr> J. E. B. Stuart from Sharpsburg to Shepherdstown on the night of
                    September 18. On the 29th of the same month Hotchkiss was recommended for
                    promotion by <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Jackson to the Secretary of War.</p>
                <p>On the 12th of December he rode with Jackson to <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr>
                    Lee's position at Fredericksburg, and in the battle of the day following
                    performed staff duty. Part of the engineering work done by <abbr expan="General"
                        >Gen.</abbr> Jackson's direction in the winter quarters at Moss Neck was his
                    proposition, under charge of <orig reg="strict">strick</orig> secrecy, of a
                    complete map from our Rappahannock river front to Philadelphia, which was
                    utilized for the Gettysburg campaign. He made the maps for the Chancellorsville
                    movements, and by an all night <orig reg="reconnaissance">reconnoisance</orig>
                    found the route for the remarkable flanking march around Hooker's front which
                    surprised and eventually stampeded his right wing (Howard's corps). Hurrying to
                    report his successful exploration to Jackson, he found him at dawn in bivouac
                    near the old Tabernacle Church, engaged in earnest conference with <abbr
                        expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Lee, and after a few moments' consultation upon
                    his intelligence Jackson put his corps in motion, and parted with his chief for
                    the last time. After he was shot that night, Hotchkiss helped to take him to the
                    rear, by a detour, avoiding the Federal line, and was sent by him to <abbr
                        expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Lee, for whom he prepared maps of the
                    locality-the basis of all since published. As engineer officer on the staff of
                        <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Ewell he rendered similar service during
                    the Gettysburg campaign, accompanying him in the battle of the first day, and
                    then observing and reporting to him movements from Seminary Ridge. On the
                    retreat he selected the position near Hagerstown where Lee offered battle to
                    Meade. At Orange <abbr expan="Courthouse">C. H.</abbr>, with other staff duty,
                    he was engaged in mapping out Meade's movements and the Mine Run campaign. In
                    the spring of 1864 <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Lee sent him to select
                    lines of defensive operations in Southwestern Virginia, where the enemy were
                    destroying furnaces and nitre works.</p>
                <p>In the Wilderness campaign he was active in staff and topographical work, and at
                    second Cold Harbor he performed for General Lee the difficult task of mapping,
                    in one day, during skirmish fire, the line of some ten miles held by our force
                    from Chickahominy to Totopotomoy and its approaches, giving him the map the same
                    day.</p>
                <p>In June, 1864, General Early took command of the Second Corps, and Captain
                    Hotchkiss accompanied him on the <orig reg="arduous">ardous</orig> expedition to
                    Maryland and forced the march to meet Hunter at Lynchburg also in his Valley
                    campaign against Sheridan. With General Gordon he made the daring <orig
                        reg="reconnaissance">reconnoisance</orig> of Sheridan's position, and the
                    sketches from which Cedar Creek was fought, and led the attacking force by a
                    mountain pass in single file to fall at daybreak like a thunderbolt on the
                    enemy's flank.</p>
                <p>Corps headquarters was at Staunton the winter following, and Hotchkiss's maps
                    were seized by order of General Grant, upon the surrender, with the view of
                    using them in connection with his official report. But when Hotchkiss insited
                    upon going to Washington with his maps, offering to copy them, Grant kindly
                    ordered their return and paid for the work of copying them.</p>
                <p>As a military man Hotchkiss was as fearless as he was efficient. It may be
                    mentioned that he had two horses shot under him. As a Confederate veteran he
                    never ceased to vindicate the cause and achievements of that army. As an author
                    his works on Chancellorsville and the Valley campaign are valuable contributions
                    to history. He has also done much technical work for the general government
                    pertaining to the war.</p>
                <p>In June, 1896, he was, by General John B. Gordon, commander-in-chief of the
                    United Confederate Veterans, commissioned upon his staff in that organization
                    brigadier-general and chief of engineers.</p>
                <p>Comrade Hotchkiss was the pioneer, adviser and acknowledged leader of the mineral
                    development of the Virginias, after the war, and his publications on that line
                    are of permanent value.</p>
                <p>Physically and mentally he was a man of mark among his fellows, of distinguished
                    appearance, pleasing address, broad and liberal views, <orig reg="exceptional"
                        >exceptionable</orig> cultivation, cheerful and hopeful disposition, and
                    genial hospitality.</p>
                <p>Thus esteeming our departed friend it is ordered by Stonewall Jackson Camp of
                    Confederate Veterans, <abbr expan="Number">No.</abbr> 25, of Staunton, Virginia,
                    that this memorial minute be entered upon our records, and a copy, furnished by
                    the Adjutant to the family of the deceased with the expression of our sincerest
                    sympathy.</p>
