                <p>This anti-Democratic newspaper article describes the rally of the Democratic
                    canididate for Congress, B. F. Myers.</p>
            </div1>
        </front>
        <body id="d4">
            <div1 type="article" id="d5">
                <p>In the beginning of last week posters around town set forth the fact that B. F.
                    Myers, the Democratic candidate for Congress, would meet his fellow citizens at
                    the Court House on Saturday evening, in order to define his position. At the
                    appointed hour, the Hall ordinary filled with Democrats and a sprinkling of
                    Republicans, the assembly was called to order by the election of B. Y. Hamsher,
                    President. Mr. Stenger, in his usual happy strain, introduced Mr. Myers-going
                    off in rhapsodies in denunciation of the nigger, etc., and winding up with the
                    distinguished gentleman's (Mr. M's) services on behalf of the border claimants.
                    The support of the Democracy to Mr. Myers, however, was <hi rend="underline"
                        >not</hi> in consideration of that gentleman's kindness in that
                    direction-or promises made that the Democratic portion of the committee were to
                    give him their undivided efforts at securing his nomination. The "foul slander"
                    was nailed with the customary "infernal damnable lie," an appropriate
                    interruption of one of the unterrified with "H--L!" and Mr. Stenger felt
                    relieved. Mr. Myers would define his position on all the questions of the day,
                    as well as the border claims.</p>
                <p>Mr. Myers now rose to address the meeting, and was received with great
                    applause.-He came among us to talk to us as friends-whether Democrats or
                    Republicans. In an hour's talk on dry statistics, he endeavored to prove that
                    the expenses of the government are double as much now as they were in the good
                    old days of James Buchanan. He succeeded first-rate, carefully avoiding,
                    however, the causes that brought about the necessity for standing armies,
                    internal revenues, income taxes, tax-collectors, &amp;c., all standing
                    monuments of modern Democracy, and that while taxes remain, every stamp you put
                    on a deed or mortgage is a sticking plaster to remind you of a Democratic
                    rebellion-Democratic in its origins and officers-Democratic in all the aid and
                    sympathy it received in the North-and sorrowed over when it was crushed by our
                    gallant armies, only by Democrats.</p>
                <p>The articles in the Harrisburg <hi rend="underline">Patriot</hi> on free
                    trade were not written by him, but he took that occasion to say that he endorsed
                    them.</p>
                <p>His war record was a dead issue, and he had hoped had been forgotten. It was the
                    greatest living progressive issues of the day that he came to speak of and not
                    the dead past. He here made some strong points, but it is doubtful whether many
                    present were able to see them, for several of the unterrified more filled with
                        <orig reg="benzene">benzine</orig> than an understanding of his powerful
                    arguments, yelled out "that's so" at the wrong times.</p>
                <p>Unlike Stenger, he left the negro down lightly, advising his friends to submit to
                    the new order of things and walk up to the polls with them gracefully. A
                    Democratic Congress could not even undo the 15th amendment, but the legality of
                    its passage would be passed upon by an unbridled Supreme Court.</p>
                <p>On the whole, Mr. Meyers acquitted himself right forcibly, and it is to be hoped,
                    for a further advancement of the cause of the great Republican party, will make
                    a thorough canvass of the county.</p>
                <p><abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Skinner was called upon after Mr. Myers
                    concluded, but apologized for not making a regular set speech, on account of the
                    lateness of the hour, when loud calls were made for Duncan. That gentlemen
                    appeared. He said the time had come, when, <hi rend="underline">politics
                    aside</hi>, every man interested in the payment of the border claims, should
                    vote for their friends-to do which they should vote for the Democratic ticket.
                    He wished it particularly understood that the claims was <hi rend="underline"
                        >not</hi> a political question, but was so only so far as a desire for
                    every one to vote the Democratic ticket. He now moved that the meeting adjourn,
                    with three rousing cheers for the ticket. This done, three more were proposed in
                    a delicate manner. Hats went up, umbrellas down, and the cheers were given with
                    a hearty good will, when a Baltimore juvenile arose and said that they-the
                    cheers-were for the Democratic candidate for Mayor of the City of Baltimore-a
                    rather fitting finale, and the crowd dispersed.</p>
