                <p>GENERAL HUNTER'S SUCCESSFUL MARCH AND SUBSEQUENT RETREAT - GENERAL JUBAL A. EARLY
                    THREATENS WASHINGTON - CHAMBERSBURG, <abbr expan="Pennsylvania">PA.</abbr>,
                    BURNED - SELECTED TO OPERATE AGAINST GENERAL EARLY - THE SHENANDOAH VALLEY - THE
                    CONFEDERATE ARMY.</p>
                <p>When the attempt to take Petersburg in conjunction with the mine explosion
                    resulted in such a dismal failure, all the operations contemplated in connection
                    with that project came to a standstill, and there was every prospect that the
                    intensely hot and sultry weather would prevent further activity in the Army of
                    the Potomac till a more propitious season. Just now, however, the conditions
                    existing in the Shenandoah Valley and along the upper Potomac demanded the
                    special attention of General Grant, for, notwithstanding the successful march
                    that Major-General David Hunter had made toward Lynchburg early in the summer,
                    what he had first gained was subsequently lost by <orig reg="strategic"
                        >strategical</orig> mistakes, that culminated in disaster during the retreat
                    he was obliged to make from the vicinity of Lynchburg <pb n="457"/> to the
                    Kanawha Valley. This route of march uncovered the lower portion of the Valley of
                    the Shenandoah, and with the exception of a small force of Union troops under
                    General Franz Sigel posted at Martinsburg for the purpose of covering the
                    Baltimore and Ohio railroad, there was nothing at hand to defend the lower
                    valley.</p>
                <p>The different bodies of Confederates which compelled Hunter's retreat were under
                    command of General Jubal A. Early, who had been sent to Lynchburg with Ewell's
                    corps after the defeat of the Confederate General W. C. Jones near Staunton on
                    the 5th of June, to take command of the Valley District. When Early had forced
                    Hunter into the Kanawha region far enough to feel assured that Lynchburg could
                    not again be threatened from that direction, he united to his own corps General
                    John C. Breckenridge's infantry division and the cavalry of Generals J. H.
                    Vaughn, John McCausland, B. T. Johnson, and J. D. Imboden, which heretofore had
                    been operating in southwest and western Virginia under General Robert Ransom,
                        <abbr expan="Junior">Jr.</abbr>, and with the column thus formed, was ready
                    to turn his attention to the lower Shenandoah Valley. At Early's suggestion
                    General Lee authorized him to move north at an opportune moment, cross the upper
                    Potomac into Maryland and threaten Washington. <pb n="458"/> Indeed, General Lee
                    had foreshadowed such a course when Early started toward Lynchburg for the
                    purpose of relieving the pressure in front of Petersburg, but was in some doubt
                    as to the practicability of the movement later, till persuaded to it by the
                    representations of Early after that general had driven Hunter beyond the
                    mountains and found little or nothing opposing except the small force of Sigel,
                    which he thought he could readily overcome by celerity of movement.</p>
                <p>By rapid marching Early reached Winchester on the 2d of July, and on the 4th
                    occupied Martinsburg, driving General Sigel out of that place the same day that
                    Hunter's troops, after their fatiguing retreat through the mountains, reached
                    Charlestown, West Virginia. Early was thus enabled to cross the Potomac without
                    difficulty, when, moving around Harper's Ferry, through the gaps of the South
                    Mountain, he found his path unobstructed till he reached the Monocacy, where
                    Ricketts's division of the Sixth Corps, and some raw troops that had been
                    collected by General Lew Wallace, met and held the Confederates till the other
                    reinforcements that had been ordered to the capital from Petersburg could be
                    brought up. Wallace contested the line of the Monocacy with obstinacy, but had
                    to retire finally toward Baltimore. The road was then open to Washing-<pb
                        n="459"/>ton, and Early marched to the outskirts and began against the
                    capital the demonstrations which were designed to divert the Army of the Potomac
                    from its main purpose in front of Petersburg.</p>
                <p>Early's audacity in thus threatening Washington had caused some concern to the
                    officials in the city, but as the movement was looked upon by General Grant as a
                    mere foray which could have no decisive issue, the Administration was not much
                    disturbed till the Confederates came in close proximity. Then was repeated the
                    alarm and consternation of two years before, fears for the safety of the capital
                    being magnified by the confusion and discord existing among the different
                    generals in Washington and Baltimore; and the imaginary dangers vanished only
                    with the appearance of General Wright, who, with the Sixth Corps and one
                    division of the Nineteenth Corps, pushed out to attack Early as soon as he could
                    get his arriving troops in hand, but under circumstances that precluded celerity
                    of movement; and as a consequence the Confederates escaped with little injury,
                    retiring across the Potomac to Leesburg, unharassed save by some Union cavalry
                    that had been sent out into Loudoun County by Hunter, who in the meantime had
                    arrived at Harper's Ferry by the Baltimore and Ohio railroad. From Leesburg
                    Early <pb n="460"/> retired through Winchester toward Strasburg, but when the
                    head of his column reached this place he found that he was being followed by
                    General Crook with the combined troops of Hunter and Sigel only, Wright having
                    returned to Washington under orders to rejoin Meade at Petersburg. This
                    reduction of the pursuing force tempting Early to resume the offensive, he
                    attacked Crook at Kernstown, and succeeded in administering such a check as to
                    necessitate this general's retreat to Martinsburg, and finally to Harper's
                    Ferry. Crook's withdrawal restored to Early the line of the upper Potomac, so,
                    recrossing this stream, he advanced again into Maryland, and sending McCausland
                    on to Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, laid that town in ashes, leaving three
                    thousand non-combatants without shelter or food.</p>
                <p>When Early fell back from the vicinity of Washington toward Strasburg, General
                    Grant believed that he would rejoin Lee, but later <orig reg="maneuvers"
                        >manoeuvres</orig> of the enemy indicated that Early had given up this idea,
                    if he ever entertained it, and intended to remain in the valley, since it would
                    furnish Lee and himself with subsistence, and also afford renewed opportunities
                    for threatening Washington. Indeed, the possession of the Valley of the
                    Shenandoah at this time was of vast <pb n="461"/> importance to Lee's army, and
                    on every hand there were indications that the Confederate Government wished to
                    hold it at least until after the crops could be gathered in to their depots at
                    Lynchburg and Richmond. Its retention, besides being of great advantage in the
                    matter of supplies, would also be a menace to the North difficult for General
                    Grant to explain, and thereby add an element of considerable benefit to the
                    Confederate cause; so when Early's troops again appeared at Martinsburg it was
                    necessary for General Grant to confront them with a force strong enough to put
                    an end to incursions north of the Potomac, which hitherto had always led to
                    National discomfiture at some critical juncture, by turning our army in eastern
                    Virginia from its chief purpose-the destruction of Lee and the capture of the
                    Confederate capital.</p>
                <p>This second <orig reg="eruption">irruption</orig> of Early, and his ruthless
                    destruction of Chambersburg led to many recommendations on the part of General
                    Grant looking to a speedy elimination of the confusion then existing among the
                    Union forces along the upper Potomac, but for a time the authorities at
                    Washington would approve none of his propositions. The President and Secretary
                    Stanton seemed unwilling to adopt his suggestions, and one measure which he
                    deemed very important-the consolida-<pb n="462"/>tion into a single command of
                    the four geographical districts into which, to relieve political pressure no
                    doubt, the territory had been divided-met with serious opposition. Despite
                    Grant's representations, he could not prevail on the Administration to approve
                    this measure, but finally the <orig reg="maneuvers">manoeuvres</orig> of Early
                    and the raid to Chambersburg compelled a partial compliance, though Grant had
                    somewhat circumvented the difficulty already by deciding to appoint a commander
                    for the forces in the field that were to operate against Early.</p>
                <p>On the 31st of July General Grant selected me as this commander, and in obedience
                    to his telegraphic summons I repaired to his headquarters at City Point. In the
                    interview that followed, he detailed to me the situation of affairs on the upper
                    Potomac, telling me that I was to command in the field the troops that were to
                    operate against Early, but that General Hunter, who was at the head of the
                    geographical department, would be continued in his position for the reason that
                    the Administration was reluctant to reconstruct or consolidate the different
                    districts. After informing me that one division of the Cavalry Corps would be
                    sent to my new command, he went on to say that he wanted me to push the enemy as
                    soon as this division arrived, and if Early retired <pb n="463"/> up the
                    Shenandoah Valley I was to pursue, but if he crossed the Potomac I was to put
                    myself south of him and try to compass his destruction. The interview having
                    ended, I returned to Hancock Station to prepare for my departure, and on the
                    evening of August 1 I was relieved from immediate duty with the Army of the
                    Potomac, but not from command of the cavalry as a corps organization.</p>
                <p>I arrived at Washington on the 4th of August, and the next day received
                    instructions from General Halleck to report to General Grant at Monocacy
                    Junction, whither he had gone direct from City Point, in consequence of a
                    characteristic <orig reg="dispatch">despatch</orig> from the President
                    indicating his disgust with the confusion, disorder, and helplessness prevailing
                    along the upper Potomac, and intimating that Grant's presence there was
                    necessary.</p>
                <p>In company with the Secretary of War I called on the President before leaving
                    Washington, and during a short conversation Mr. Lincoln candidly told me that
                    Mr. Stanton had objected to my assignment to General Hunter's command, because
                    he thought me too young, and that he himself had concurred with the Secretary;
                    but now, since General Grant had "ploughed round" the difficulties of the
                    situation by picking me out to command the "boys in the field," he felt
                        satis-<pb n="464"/>fied with what had been done, and "hoped for the best."
                    Mr. Stanton remained silent during these remarks, never once indicating whether
                    he, too, had become reconciled to my selection or not; and although, after we
                    left the White House, he conversed with me freely in regard to the campaign I
                    was expected to make, seeking to impress on me the necessity for success from
                    the political as well as from the military point of view, yet he utterly ignored
                    the fact that he had taken any part in disapproving the recommendation of the
                    general-in-chief.</p>
                <p>August 6 I reported to General Grant at the Monocacy, and he there turned over to
                    me the following instructions, which he had previously prepared for General
                    Hunter in the expectation that <unclear>at</unclear> general would continue to
                    command the department:</p>
                <p>"HEADQUARTERS IN THE FIELD, <lb/> "Monocacy Bridge, <abbr expan="Maryland"
                    >Md.</abbr>, <abbr expan="August">Aug</abbr>. 5, 1864. </p>
                <p>"GENERAL: Concentrate all your available force without delay in the vicinity of
                    Harper's Ferry, leaving only such railroad guards and garrisons for public
                    property as may be necessary.</p>
                <p>"Use in this concentration the railroad, if by so doing time can be saved. From
                    Harper's Ferry, if it is found that the enemy has moved north of the Potomac in
                    large force, push north, following and attacking him wherever found; following
                    him, if driven south of the Potomac, as long as it is safe to do so. If it is
                    ascertained that the enemy has but a small force north of the Potomac, then push
                    south the main force, detaching, under a competent commander, a sufficient force
                    to look <pb n="465"/> after the raiders and drive them to their homes. In
                    detaching such a force, the brigade of cavalry now <hi rend="underline">en
                        route</hi> from Washington <hi rend="underline">via</hi> Rockville may
                    be taken into account. </p>
                <p>"There are now on the way to join you three other brigades of the best of
                    cavalry, numbering at least five thousand men and horses. These will be
                    instructed, in the absence of further orders, to join you by the south side of
                    the Potomac. One brigade will probably start to-morrow.</p>
                <p>"In pushing up the Shenandoah Valley, as it is expected you will have to go first
                    or last, it is desirable that nothing should be left to invite the enemy to
                    return. Take all provisions, forage, and stock wanted for the use of your
                    command. Such as cannot be consumed, destroy. It is not desirable that the
                    buildings should be destroyed-they should, rather, be protected; but the people
                    should be informed that so long as an army can subsist among them recurrences of
                    these raids must be expected, and we are determined to stop them at all hazards.</p>
                <p>"Bear in mind, the object is to drive the enemy south; and to do this you want to
                    keep him always in sight. Be guided in your course by the course he takes.</p>
                <p>"Make your own arrangements for supplies of all kinds, giving regular vouchers
                    for such as may be taken from loyal citizens in the country through which you
                    march.</p>
                <p>"Very respectfully,<lb/> "U. S. GRANT, <abbr expan="Lieutenant"
                    >Lieut.</abbr>-General."</p>
                <p>"Major-General D. HUNTER,<lb/> "Commanding Department of West Virginia."</p>
                <p>When I had read the letter addressed to Hunter, General Grant said I would be
                    expected to report directly to him, as Hunter had asked that day to be wholly
                    relieved, not from any chagrin at my assignment to the control of the active
                    forces of his command, but because he thought that his fitness for the position
                    he was filling was dis-<pb n="466"/>trusted by General Halleck, and he had no
                    wish to cause embarrassment by remaining where he could but remove me one degree
                    from the headquarters of the army. The next day Hunter's unselfish request was
                    complied with, and an order was issued by the President, consolidating the
                    Middle Department, the Department of Washington, the Department of the
                    Susquehanna, and the Department of West Virginia.</p>
                <p>Under this order these four geographical districts constituted the Middle
                    Military Division, and I was temporarily assigned to command it. Hunter's men
                    had been bivouacking for some days past in the vicinity of Monocacy Junction and
                    Frederick, but before General Grant's instructions were written out, Hunter had
                    conformed to them by directing the concentration at Halltown, about four miles
                    in front of Harper's Ferry, of all his force available for field service.
                    Therefore the different bodies of troops, with the exception of Averell's
                    cavalry, which had followed McCausland toward Moorefield after the burning of
                    Chambersburg, were all in motion toward Halltown on August 6.</p>
                <p>Affairs at Monocacy kept me but an hour or two, and these disposed of, I
                    continued on to Harper's Ferry by the special train which had brought me from
                    Washington, that point being <pb n="467"/> intended as my headquarters while
                    making preparations to advance. The enemy was occupying Martinsburg,
                    Williamsport, and Shepherdstown at the time; sending occasional raiding parties
                    into Maryland as far as Hagerstown. The concentration of my troops at Halltown
                    being an indication to Early that we intended to renew the offensive, however,
                    he immediately began counter preparations by drawing in all his detached columns
                    from the north side of the Potomac, abandoning a contemplated raid into
                    Maryland, which his success against Crook at Kernstown had prompted him to
                    project, and otherwise disposing himself for defense.</p>
                <p>At Harper's Ferry I made my headquarters in the second story of a small and very
                    dilapidated hotel, and as soon as settled sent for Lieutenant John R. Meigs, the
                    chief engineer officer of the command, to study with him the maps of my
                    geographical division. It always came rather easy to me to learn the geography
                    of a new section, and its important topographical features as well; therefore I
                    found that, with the aid of Meigs, who was most intelligent in his profession,
                    the region in which I was to operate would soon be well fixed in my mind. Meigs
                    was familiar with every important road and stream, and with all points worthy of
                    note west of the Blue Ridge, <pb n="468"/> and was particularly well equipped
                    with knowledge regarding the Shenandoah Valley, even down to the farm-houses. He
                    imparted with great readiness what he knew of this, clearly pointing out its
                    configuration and indicating the strongest points for Confederate defense, at
                    the same time illustrating scientifically and forcibly the peculiar
                    disadvantages under which the Union army had hitherto labored.</p>
                <p>The section that received my closest attention has its northern limit along the
                    Potomac between McCoy's ferry at the eastern base of the North Mountain, and
                    Harper's Ferry at the western base of the Blue Ridge. The southern limit is
                    south of Staunton, on the divide which separates the waters flowing into the
                    Potomac from those that run to the James. The western boundary is the eastern
                    slope of the Alleghany Mountains, the eastern, the Blue Ridge; these two
                    distinct mountain ranges trending about southwest <orig reg="enclose"
                    >inclose</orig> a stretch of quite open, undulating country varying in width
                    from the northern to the southern extremity, and dotted at frequent intervals
                    with patches of heavy woods. At Martinsburg the valley is about sixty miles
                    broad, and on an east and west line drawn through Winchester about forty-five,
                    while at Strasburg it narrows down to about twenty-five. Just southeast of
                    Strasburg, <pb n="469"/> which is nearly midway between the eastern and western
                    walls of the valley, rises an abrupt range of mountains called Massanutten,
                    consisting of several ridges which extend southward between the North and South
                    Forks of the Shenandoah River until, losing their identity, they merge into
                    lower but broken ground between New Market and Harrisonburg. The Massanutten
                    ranges, with their spurs and hills, divide the Shenandoah Valley into two
                    valleys, the one next the Blue Ridge being called the Luray, while that next the
                    North Mountain retains the name of Shenandoah.</p>
                <p>A broad macadamized road, leading south from Williamsport, Maryland, to
                    Lexington, Virginia, was built at an early day to connect the interior of the
                    latter State with the Chesapeake and Ohio canal, and along this road are
                    situated the principal towns and villages of the Shenandoah Valley, with lateral
                    lines of communication extending to the mountain ranges on the east and west.
                    The roads running toward the Blue Ridge are nearly all macadamized, and the
                    principal ones lead to the railroad system of eastern Virginia through
                    Snicker's, Ashby's Manassas, Chester, Thornton's Swift Run, Brown's and
                    Rock-fish gaps, tending to an ultimate <orig reg="center">centre</orig> at
                    Richmond. These gaps are low and easy, offering little obstruction to the march
                    of an army coming from eastern Virginia, <pb n="470"/> and thus the Union troops
                    operating west of the Blue Ridge were always subjected to the perils of a flank
                    attack; for the Confederates could readily be brought by rail to Gordonsville
                    and Charlottesville, from which points they could move with such celerity
                    through the Blue Ridge that, on more than one occasion, the Shenandoah Valley
                    had been the <abbr expan="theater">theatre</abbr> of Confederate success, due
                    greatly to the advantage of possessing these interior lines.</p>
                <p>Nature had been very kind to the valley, making it rich and productive to an
                    exceptional degree, and though for three years contending armies had been
                    marching up and down it, the fertile soil still yielded ample subsistence for
                    Early's men, with a large surplus for the army of Lee. The ground had long been
                    well cleared of timber, and the rolling surface presented so few obstacles to
                    the movement of armies that they could march over the country in any direction
                    almost as well as on the roads, the creeks and rivers being everywhere fordable,
                    with little or no difficulty beyond that of leveling the approaches.</p>
                <p>I had opposing me an army largely composed of troops that had operated in this
                    region hitherto under "Stonewall" Jackson with marked success, inflicting defeat
                    on the Union forces almost every time the two armies had come in contact. <pb
                        n="471"/> These men were now commanded by a veteran officer of the
                    Confederacy-General Jubal A. Early-whose past services had so <orig
                        reg="signalled">signalized</orig> his ability that General Lee specially
                    selected him to take charge of the Valley District, and, notwithstanding the
                    misfortunes that befell him later, clung to him till the end of the war. The
                    Confederate army at this date was about twenty thousand strong, and consisted of
                    Early's own corps, with Generals Rodes, Ramseur, and Gordon commanding its
                    divisions; the infantry of Breckenridge from southwestern Virginia; three
                    battalions of artillery; and the cavalry brigades of Vaughn, Johnson,
                    McCausland, and Imboden. This cavalry was a short time afterward organized into
                    a division under the command of General Lomax.</p>
                <p>After discovering that my troops were massing in front of Harper's Ferry, Early
                    lost not a moment in concentrating his in the vicinity of Martinsburg, in
                    positions from which he could continue to obstruct the Baltimore and Ohio
                    railroad, and yet be enabled to retire up the valley under conditions of safety
                    when I should begin an offensive campaign.</p>
                <p>When I took command of the Army of the Shenandoah its infantry force comprised
                    the Sixth Corps, one division of the Nineteenth Corps, and two divisions from
                    West Virginia. The Sixth Corps <pb n="472"/> was commanded by Major-General
                    Horatio G. Wright; its three divisions by Brigadier-Generals David A. Russell,
                    Geo. W. Getty, and James B. Ricketts. The single division of the Nineteenth
                    Corps had for its immediate chief Brigadier-General William Dwight, the corps
                    being commanded by Brigadier-General Wm. H. Emory. The troops from West Virginia
                    were under Brigadier-General George Crook, with Colonels Joseph Thoburn and
                    Isaac H. Duval as division commanders, and though in all not more than one
                    fair-sized division, they had been designated, on account of the department they
                    belonged to, the Army of West Virginia. General Torbert's division, then
                    arriving from the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Potomac, represented the
                    mounted arm of the service, and in the expectation that Averell would soon join
                    me with his troopers, I assigned General Torbert as chief of cavalry, and
                    General Wesley Merritt succeeded to the command of Torbert's division.</p>
                <p>General Wright, the commander of the Sixth Corps, was an officer of high standing
                    in the Corps of Engineers, and had seen much active service during the preceding
                    three years. He commanded the Department of the Ohio throughout the very trying
                    period of the summer and fall of 1862, and while in that position he, with other
                        <pb n="473"/> prominent officers, recommended my appointment as a
                    brigadier-general. In 1863 he rendered valuable service at the battle of
                    Gettysburg, following which he was assigned to the Sixth Corps, and commanded it
                    at the capture of the Confederate works at Rappahannock Station and in the
                    operations at Mine Run. He ranked me as a major-general of volunteers by nearly
                    a year in date of commission, but my assignment by the President to the command
                    of the army in the valley met with Wright's approbation, and, so far as I have
                    ever known, he never questioned the propriety of the President's action. The
                    Sixth Corps division commanders, Getty, Russell, and Ricketts, were all educated
                    soldiers, whose records, beginning with the Mexican War, had already been
                    illustrated in the war of the rebellion by distinguished service in the Army of
                    the Potomac.</p>
                <p>General Emory was a veteran, having graduated at the Military Academy in 1831,
                    the year I was born. In early life he had seen much service in the Artillery,
                    the Topographical Engineers, and the Cavalry, and in the war of the rebellion
                    had exhibited the most soldierly characteristics at Port Hudson and on the Red
                    River campaign. At this time he had but one division of the Nineteenth Corps
                    present, which division was well commanded by General Dwight, a volunteer
                        offi-<pb n="474"/>cer who had risen to the grade of brigadier-general
                    through constant hard work. Crook was a classmate of mine-at least, we entered
                    the Military Academy the same year, though he graduated a year ahead of me. We
                    had known each other as boys before we entered the army, and later as men, and I
                    placed implicit faith in his experience and qualifications as a general.</p>
                <p>The transfer of Torbert to the position of chief of cavalry left Merritt, as I
                    have already said, in command of the First Cavalry Division. He had been tried
                    in the place before, and from the day he was selected as one of a number of
                    young men to be appointed general officers, with the object of giving life to
                    the Cavalry Corps, he filled the measure of expectation. Custer was one of these
                    young men too, and though as yet commanding a brigade under Merritt, his gallant
                    fight at Trevillian Station, as well as a dozen others during the summer,
                    indicated that he would be equal to the work that was to fall to him when in a
                    few weeks he should succeed Wilson. But to go on down the scale of rank,
                    describing the officers who commanded in the Army of the Shenandoah, would carry
                    me beyond all limit, so I refrain from the digression with regret that I cannot
                    pay to each his well-earned tribute.</p>
                <p>The force that I could take with me into the <pb n="475"/> field at this time
                    numbered about 26,000 men. Within the limits of the geographical division there
                    was a much greater number of troops than this. Baltimore, Washington, Harper's
                    Ferry, Hagerstown, Frederick, Cumberland, and a score of other points; besides
                    the strong detachments that it took to keep the Baltimore and Ohio railroad open
                    through the mountains of West Virginia, and escorts for my trains, absorbed so
                    many men that the column which could be made available for field operations was
                    small when compared with the showing on paper. Indeed, it was much less than it
                    ought to have been, but for me, in the face of the opposition made by different
                    interests involved, to detach troops from any of the points to which they had
                    been distributed before I took charge was next to impossible.</p>
                <p>In a few days after my arrival preparations were completed, and I was ready to
                    make the first move for the possession of the Shenandoah Valley. For the next
                    five weeks the operations on my part consisted almost wholly of offensive and
                    defensive <orig reg="maneuvering">manoeuvring</orig> for certain advantages, the
                    enemy confining himself meanwhile to measures intended to counteract my designs.
                    Upon the advent of Torbert, Early immediately grew suspicious, and fell back
                    twelve miles south <pb n="476"/> of Martinsburg, to Bunker Hill and vicinity,
                    where his right flank would be less exposed, but from which position he could
                    continue to maintain the break in the Baltimore and Ohio railroad, and push
                        <orig reg="reconnoitering">reconnoitring</orig> parties through Smithfield
                    to Charlestown. These <orig reg="reconnoitering">reconnoitring</orig> parties
                    exhibited considerable boldness at times, but since they had no purpose in view
                    save to discover whether or not we were moving, I did not contest any ground
                    with them except about our outposts. Indeed, I desired that Early might remain
                    at some point well to the north till I was fully prepared to throw my army on
                    his right and rear and force a battle, and hence I abstained from disturbing him
                    by premature activity, for I thought that if I could beat him at Winchester, or
                    north of it, there would be far greater chances of weighty results. I therefore
                    determined to bring my troops, if it were at all possible to do so, into such a
                    position near that town as to oblige Early to fight. The sequel proved, however,
                    that he was accurately informed of all my movements. To anticipate them,
                    therefore, he began his retreat up the valley the day that I moved out from
                    Halltown, and consequently was able to place himself south of Winchester before
                    I could get there.</p>
