<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> This brief article discusses the officers of the West Augusta Guard and features
                    a photograph of them.</p>
<p>In sending a sketch of Capt. L. H. Waters for the
                    Veteran's "Last Roll" Col. James Bumgardner, of
                    Staunton, Va., includes a group picture of the
                    West Augusta Guard, of whom he is the only survivor, and writes: "Of the
                    officers of the West Augusta Guard, which was organized just before the
                    organization of the 3d Regiment of Virginia Volunteers (afterwards the 5th
                    Regiment Virginia Infantry of the Stonewall Brigade), Capt. W. S. H. Baylor (afterwards Colonel Baylor, of the 5th
                    Infantry) was killed in the second battle of Manassas, Lieut. Henry King Cochran was killed just after the burning of
                    Chambersburg, Lieut. (afterwards Capt.) Thomas A. Burke died three years ago, and
                    Captain Waters recently."</p>
<p>Colonel Bumgardner is mentioned in "War Records," Series I., Volume XII., Part
                    I., page 393, by Colonel Harmon, who states: "It is due to my personal staff to
                    mention Adjt. James Bumgardner in the very highest terms for his gallantry and
                    intrepidity."</p>
