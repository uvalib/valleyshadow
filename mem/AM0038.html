<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> Amusing description of a battlefield encounter.</p>
<p>Comrade Carter Berkeley, of Staunton, Va., states
                    that James Bryan, an inmate of the Soldiers' Home at Richmond (who spent the
                    summer with his friend Lieut.Gov. Echols), went out with Company I, Fifth
                    Virginia Regiment, Stonewall Brigade. No finer soldier ever pulled a trigger
                    than Jim, and he was badly wounded several times. At the bloody angle, Capt. Charles S. Arnall was acting adjutant of the
                    Stonewall Brigade, and in passing the Fifth Regiment he heard a voice coming
                    from the line of battle that was fighting desperately: "Hello, Captain!" He
                    turned and saw Jim in the front rank loading his gun. He said: "Captain, you see
                    me, don't you?" The next day the Captain saw Jim, and said: "Jim, what in the
                    world did you stop me in that awful place yesterday for?" He replied: "Captain,
                    wasn't that the hottest place you ever saw?" The Captain said it was. "Well,"
                    said Jim, "I only wanted a witness that I was there."</p>
