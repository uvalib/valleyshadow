<h3 class="section-head">Augusta County: "Sheridan at Winchester," by Benjamin W.
                            Crowninshield, 1878</h3>
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> This article provides a detailed account of William Sheridan at Cedar Creek, from
                    the perspective of Crowninshield, who rode with Sheridan and who frames this
                    battle account as part of the larger campaign in the Shenandoah Valley.
                    Crowninshield praises Sheridan and disparages the opposing general, Jubal Early
                    (though the article goes out of its way to praise the marching ability of
                    Confederate troops). The article also offers generous praise to Mosby.</p>
<p>As it has been recently stated that the story of Sheridan's ride at the battle of
                    Cedar Creek is a fiction, and as many other late statements in the newspapers
                    about the Shenandoah Valley campaign of 1864 under Sheridan are incorrect, it
                    seems due to the memory of the brave dead and gallant living officers and men of
                    Sheridan's army that some one should give an
                    authoritative account of the campaign and the man, and especially of the fight
                    at Cedar Creek. I shall therefore relate in brief the facts of the campaign,
                    merely premising that I was on Sheridan's staff and present at all the battles.</p>
<p>During the whole war the Shenandoah Valley offered to the Confederates an easy
                    road north, being supplied with railroads and a macadamized turnpike, probably
                    at that time the best road in the South. The valley itself was very fertile,
                    and, notwithstanding the fighting for three years, in 1864 it has full of
                    supplies, which, on account of the open country, their troops could easily
                    gather and transport. On the west the mountains were difficult to pass, and
                    nobody wanted to go that way. To the northeast lay Washington, and northward the
                    road to Baltimore. Philadelphia was up a valley equally practicable with the
                    Shenandoah itself, and in fact a continuation of it, flanked by the same two
                    ranges of mountains, with the watershed, of course, in an opposite direction.
                    Still the decline in each valley was so slight that the terms <u>up</u> and <u>down</u> were
                    strangely mixed; generally it was called <u>down</u> the
                    Shenandoah towards Staunton (perhaps because we are apt to associate the terms
                        <u>down</u> and <u>south</u>.)
                    Across the Blue Ridge lay the counties of Loudon and Fauquier, a beautiful
                    rolling country, generally open, but well supplied with woods and a network of
                    small roads besides good turnpikes. Here was the home of Mosby's battalion, and
                    in spite of all attempts to drive him away here he remained, during the whole
                    war, master of the situation, ready to harass our lines of communication south
                    by the Orange and Alexandria Railroad and the roads towards Richmond; and by
                    crossing the Blue Ridge he was at once on the flank of our army in the
                    Shenandoah. It probably took, all through the war, in one place and another,
                    twenty thousand men to watch Mosby's command. Seldom remaining to fight, he was
                    ubiquitous, and the amount of property he destroyed and the number of prisoners
                    he captured during the war were something marvelous. No wagon train
                    could move unless strongly guarded, and even then was almost at his mercy.</p>
<p>There seemed to be for our arms something akin to fatality in the Shenandoah
                    Valley. It witnessed during this war many battles and gallant fights, but also
                    for us several sad disasters and retreats. Especially was it expensive to us in
                    the material of war. The captures by the Confederates were so considerable that
                    it could almost be said to be to them an arsenal, besides providing enormous
                    supplies of provisions for their armies.</p>
<p>What happened in 1861, 1862, and 1863 in the valley has frequently been
                    described, with the wonderful doings of Ashby, Ewell, Stonewall Jackson, and
                    others on the Confederate side, and the campaigns of Banks, Shields, Milroy,
                    which surely deserve the term remarkable.</p>
<p>Stonewall Jackson achieved great reputation for his marches, fights, and captures
                    there, and the valley gave more renown to him than to any other general of
                    either army, excepting Sheridan. The avenue to and from Antietam and Gettysburg,
                    for Lee's troops, was by the valley.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1864, General Hunter, with a rather heterogeneous command,
                    marched up to near Lynchburg, for a time having everything his own way, but he
                    met no well-organized Southern troops. Finally, in July, Lee detached Early, who
                    hustled Hunter out in quick time, crossed the Potomac, and advanced through
                    Maryland towards Washington, where he came within a hair's-breadth of taking the
                    city. His advance caused a panic at the North, and gold reached its highest
                    figure, 285, in consequence.</p>
<p>The sixth and nineteenth army corps, the one from Grant in front of Petersburg,
                    the other from the James (being then on ships just front New Orleans), were
                    dispatched in haste to defend the capital, and arrived in the very nick of time.
                    Early pushed back through Maryland, retired only across the Potomac, and from
                    there again menaced Pennsylvania and Maryland. Washington drew a long breath of
                    relief, and the chiefs there now determined to take the valley in hand in
                    earnest. The sixth corps crossed the Blue Ridge at Snicker's Gap, having a
                    lively little affair at the ford across the Shenandoah. Sheridan was summoned
                    from the front of Petersburg, and two of the three divisions of his cavalry
                    joined him in the valley. Making his head-quarters at Harper's Ferry, he quickly
                    assembled his forces, and prepared for the work allotted to him. In one week he
                    was ready, having under him three divisions of the sixth corps (under Wright),
                    two of the nineteenth (Emory), and two of the eighth (Crook); two divisions and
                    a brigade of cavalry under Torbert, and one (Averill) afterwards detached.</p>
<p>On his taking command of the army in the valley the Middle Military Division was
                    created for General Sheridan,-a large command, including generally all the
                    Middle States, and Virginia north of the James. Orders were issued from General
                    Grant to General Sheridan carefully to watch the valley and Early's army, but to
                    avoid a general engagement, unless forced into it. Consequently our army
                    advanced to Battletown (Berryville), and up the valley to Newtown and
                    Middletown; then retreated to Charlestown and Harper's Ferry, closely followed
                    by Early, who was reinforced by a large body of cavalry and Anderson's division
                    of Longstreet's corps, fighting meanwhile only skirmishes, which were almost
                    always to our advantage. Several of these were worthy of especial mention, as
                    entire infantry regiments were charged and captured by our cavalry on two
                    occasions.</p>
<p>Early now retreated via Charlestown across the Opequan, and with
                    headquarters between Winchester and Martinsburg he occupied the line of the
                    Opequan Creek. Sheridan continually engaged Early's attention by reconnoissances, and advanced up the valley to
                    near Battletown. Early was equally active, and threatened attacks frequently.
                    But Early's game was essentially one of bluff. He was attempting, with an
                    inferior force, to occupy too much ground, and September 19th found him spread
                    out from Winchester nearly to Martinsburg, with Sheridan's army well
                    concentrated at Battletown, only ten miles from Winchester, and with the Opequan
                    Creek between. General Sheridan had repeatedly and in vain requested leave to
                    attack, and General Grant finally came up from Petersburg to Charlestown, where
                    Sheridan met him, and demonstrated to him the state of affairs and the good
                    chance to fight and defeat Early. Grant at last gave the coveted permission,
                    arrangements were made, and in two days the battle of Winchester was fought.
                    Early not only did not "force the battle," as is stated in some papers, but was
                    surprised, and came very near total destruction.</p>
<p>Our army marched at two A. M., September 19th. The march to Opequan Creek was
                    soon made, and before daylight the sixth corps was across. The passage was
                    difficult, as the descent to the creek from the east towards Winchester is
                    steep; the creek had to be forded; and on the west side is a defile, heavily
                    wooded, of about two miles before ground is reached where a line of battle can
                    be formed. About noon the sixth and nineteenth corps deployed, and advanced
                    without waiting for the eighth corps, and the battle of Winchester commenced.
                    The sixth corps, on the left and centre, was carrying
                    all before it, but the second division of the nineteenth corps (the first being
                    in reserve) was taken in flank by the Confederates and very roughly handled, and
                    had to retreat, the enemy not advancing. A long lull followed until the eighth
                    corps came up. Meanwhile our cavalry, crossing several miles down the Opequan,
                    advanced against the Confederate cavalry, and driving it in pursued it towards
                    Winchester. At about one hour before sunset our three corps advanced, and the
                    cavalry came in on then enemy just outside Winchester. Our two attacks were
                    consequently at right angles. The cavalry rode over an infantry division
                    (Wheaton), while our infantry swept the enemy before them in wild confusion.
                    Nightfall alone saved Early, who took to flight, leaving in our hands three
                    thousand prisoners, five guns, and seven colors. Winchester was full of his
                    wounded, who, deserted by their surgeons, were left to our care.</p>
<p>The next day, by marching all night, Early took up his position at Fisher's Hill
                    (the strongest one in the valley, and one considered impregnable). It is a hill
                    just beyond Strasburg, running across the valley, and so steep towards the south
                    as to be almost a precipice for about a mile each side of the turnpike road.
                    Towards the west the elevation is less and the slope more gradual. Following
                    close upon Early's heels, our troops came up and posted themselves in his front.
                    Sheridan at once carefully reconnoitred his
                    position, and on the 22d, making little attacks on Early's front, he sent Crook
                    with the eighth corps round his left flank to feel of him. Early, not relying on
                    the natural strength of the position, had thrown up considerable works and dug
                    rifle-pits. His guns were placed behind breastworks, and even embrasures were
                    constructed. Our cavalry were sent up the little valley (Luray), and only the
                    infantry and artillery were opposite Early.</p>
<p>After sending Crook out on the right, General Sheridan, with a few of his staff,
                    sat on his horse, about the centre of our line,
                    eagerly watching the enemy to note the effect of Crook's attack. The opening
                    guns were fired late in the afternoon, when suddenly the enemy were seen to
                    falter and retreat. Sheridan exclaimed, "By God, Crook is driving them!" and
                    immediately ordered a general advance. Our troops rushed forward down one side,
                    up the steep hill, across the rebel works, and in a moment, as it
                    were, the position was taken, and Early's army, two days after Winchester, again
                    defeated, with a loss of twenty-one guns and some twelve hundred prisoners. The
                    general and officers of the staff with him dashed forward with the troops, and
                    entered the works with them. Captain Martin, of the staff, captured a gun with
                    his own hands; and an infantry soldier, not having his gun loaded, in the
                    excitement knocked the driver of a cannon, who was trying to get it away, off
                    his horse with a stone, and took the piece. Sheridan personally urged on the
                    troops, and kept with the advanced guard all night. In a late newspaper article
                    it is even stated that Sheridan was unequal to handling an army; that in fact he
                    blundered on his success; and one is left to believe that he was a coarse,
                    swearing trooper, fit only to command a company, or at most a regiment, of
                    cavalry. Probably during the whole war no general made a better disposition of
                    his troops in a battle, or a better plan for a battle or campaign. In one
                    respect Sheridan was especially remarkable: that was in himself watching the
                    troops in battle, seeing for himself what was done, and taking instant advantage
                    of the chances that offered. Darkness and our want of cavalry saved Early from
                    utter ruin. Our army followed Early all night, a constant skirmish going on
                    between our advance and his rear, and no halt was made until Woodstock was
                    reached. Early's army, in sadly demoralized condition, managed to get away,
                    pursued by our army as far as Staunton. Every day we captured stragglers in
                    large numbers; the whole country about was full of them, and quantities got away
                    across the mountains to the east and west, joining Early further up the valley.
                    Our main army halted at Harrisonburg, the cavalry going to Staunton. While we
                    were here came the order from Washington to destroy all the mills, forage, and
                    provisions, and to retreat, leaving behind us a country incapable of supporting
                    an army. Nobody who was one of that army will ever forget the scenes of our
                    retreat. By day the smoke obscured the sun; by night a lurid sky reflected the
                    glare of burning barns and stacks of grain and hay for twice twenty-four hours.
                    Early's army was supposed to be ruined, if not annihilated. But on the 8th of
                    October, towards evening, came the familiar sound of artillery, and again
                    appeared the Confederate cavalry (this time commanded by Rosser), sharply
                    following up our army. Next morning about four A. M., at head-quarters at
                    Strasburg, General Torbert, in command of all our cavalry, rode up on his
                    beautiful gray horse, with large staff, colors, and escort. Dismounting in front
                    of the log fire, he found Sheridan impatiently pacing up and down in front of
                    his tent. Torbert advanced with "Good morning, general." Sheridan drew himself
                    up, faced Torbert, and said, "General Torbert, get upon your horse, and don't
                    let me see you again until either you have beaten the rebel cavalry, or they
                    have beaten you!" Torbert got on his horse, and rode rapidly off without saying
                    a word. The noise of artillery soon told of the opening attack. Just outside
                    Strasburg is a hill thickly wooded. In a line running north and south the trees
                    were felled, forming a notch between the dark spruces. The rebels had made this
                    for a signal station. Our signal corps occupied it. Soon the flag waved down,
                    "three guns captured;" again, "five guns captured." The firing grew more
                    distant, and finally became inaudible. But the little flag waved down to us at
                    head-quarters the welcome news, growing successively more welcome and glorious,
                    until the captures by our cavalry grew to eleven guns, wagons, prisoners, etc.;
                    or, in the language of the report, "all the rebels had on wheels."</p>
<p>That fight was known to our men as the "Woodstock races," as our cavalry pursued
                    Rosser ("the saviour of the valley") twenty-six miles,
                    through Woodstock, capturing from him all his artillery, and his head-quarter
                    wagons among the rest. Next day General Custer, who, as always, was conspicuous
                    in the fight, and who captured Rosser's luggage, appeared at head-quarters in a
                    new suit of his, as a Confederate general. After  this it was long
                    before the Confederate cavalry was seen again.</p>
<p>The sixth corps now went towards the army of the Potomac at Petersburg, and it
                    was thought that Early's army would not again attempt to move down the valley;
                    but they had got no further than the crossing of the Shenandoah River by White
                    Post, on their way to Alexandria, before Early became demonstrative, and the
                    sixth corps rejoined Sheridan at the line of Cedar Creek, near Middletown,
                    taking position upon the right of the line. Sheridan posted his army across the
                    turnpike on the north side of Cedar Creek, in a position unassailable on the
                    front: the nineteenth corps in the center, the sixth, on the right, and, the
                    eighth on the left. The land was higher at Middletown and upon the left of the
                    turnpike to Cedar Creek than upon the right; and it was also high along the
                    creek, with a defile in front and a steep descent to the rear. On this ridge was
                    placed the artillery of the nineteenth corps, with the infantry in camp in the
                    low land to the rear. A wide plain extended from there, parallel to the creek,
                    to the road, and for about a mile to the rear. The eighth corps was in camp on
                    the heights on the left of the road, between Middletown and Cedar Creek, on
                    barren hills overlooking the wooded valley to our left and front, and also
                    looking to the right down across the plain in the rear of the nineteenth corps
                    position. The cavalry was on our right and rear, guarding the back road and all
                    the approaches from the right. Evidently, then, our left was the only assailable
                    part of our position, and here the pickets were well out in front and to the
                    left on the creek, and the position a commanding one. The army lay in this place
                    about a week, getting up supplies, and resting after the severe marches of the
                    past month. As our force outnumbered Early's, and was moreover in admirable
                    condition after its victories, it might well feel secure in its strong position.
                    The question now was how to hold on to the valley and yet send away the sixth
                    corps to the army of the Potomac. It was proposed to fortify the line of Front
                    Royal and Cedar Creek, and supply an intrenched
                    camp from Alexandria by opening the Manassas Gap Railroad through Loudon County
                    by way of Manassas Gap to Front Royal. General Augur was sent from Washington
                    with troops along the line of the railroad into the heart of what was known as
                    Mosby's Confederacy (where his command now consisted of nearly sixteen hundred
                    men and a battery of guns), to open the railroad. General Sheridan was ordered
                    to cross the mountains, meet Augur, and proceed to Washington, to arrange a plan
                    for holding the valley on the line proposed. Taking a few members of his staff,
                    he went across the Blue Ridge to Washington, and was on his way back, having got
                    as far as Winchester, on the 19th of October.</p>
<p>Early displayed considerable activity about the 16th of October, moving his men
                    about, and sending some infantry almost up to our cavalry pickets on the right.
                    On the 18th, Gordon's division moved to our left, and at night made the march
                    with great caution,-even dispensing with canteens on account of noise,-through
                    the woods, to a point across the creek near our picket line, on our extreme
                    left; Early, meantime, moving up the balance of his army close to our lines in
                    front, ready to cross the bridge over the creek at the turnpike.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 19th, an hour before dawn, Gordon attacked our pickets with
                    his main force, and immediately followed them into our positions, allowing no
                    time for an alarm. The attack was a perfect success, Crook's troops being
                    surprised in their camps and in their tents. Sleeping men were killed, and in
                    half an hour the eighth corps became a disorganized mob, fleeing wildly down the
                    valley pike through Middletown. For the rest of the 19th of October, the eighth
                    corps was <u>hors de combat</u>. Gordon captured many
                    prisoners and several guns in his attack, cleared the bridge across the creek,
                    and allowed the balance of Early's army to cross unopposed. From the position of
                    the eighth corps, and from the turnpike where Early now was, the Confederate  army could look down upon Sheridan's head-quarters across the
                    plain, in rear of the nineteenth corps artillery, and he could enfilade all our
                    position with the fire of his guns. General Crook dashed off to try to rally his
                    corps. General Wright rode to Sheridan's head-quarters, and, seeing the
                    condition of things, at once marched his corps to the left and formed a new
                    line. But Early had already captured eighteen guns, the entire camp of the
                    eighth corps, and much equipage, etc., from the nineteenth corps, who were
                    obliged to leave their camp in haste. Here Early's troops failed. So far their
                    attack had been bold, well planned, and perfectly successful. But now came a
                    disastrous halt to plunder the captured camps.</p>
<p>The nineteenth and sixth corps had not lost a man, and marched out to the fight
                    in perfect order. The sixth corps in advance commenced the fight just to the
                    right of Middletown, and held the enemy in check, the first division being
                    principally engaged. The nineteenth corps was on our right. The cavalry under
                    Torbert crossed to our extreme left, and occupied the pike. The army was not
                    well handled, though, and General Torbert for a long time received no orders,
                    marching to the pike on his own responsibility. The troops were steady, and all
                    expected orders to advance; but instead our line gradually fell back, followed
                    slowly by the enemy. At about three P. M., on General Emory's front was open,
                    descending ground for more than a mile, nearly to where the sixth corps had been
                    encamped. He marched sullenly to the rear, to the crest of a hill looking down
                    on Early's troops slowly advancing in line of battle. As they approached, the
                    artillery threw shot up the long hill. The writer of this article was at this
                    time with Emory. He looked at the advancing enemy, and at his troops, who had
                    hardly fired a shot all day. Then he said, uttering the thoughts of the entire
                    army, "What will Sheridan say! It is a d-----d shame to retreat until we are
                    beaten, and I'll be d-----d if I retreat any further!" He ordered his men to
                    make a breastwork of rails along the crest of the hill, and was giving
                    directions to defend it, when orders came from General Wright to retreat, and
                    almost immediately to the left could be seen, coming out of some woods, the head
                    of two columns with the colors of the first and second divisions of the sixth
                    corps. I rode for a while with General Wheaton at the head of the first
                    division, sixth corps, talking of the sad event of the day, until the valley
                    pike came into view across some fields. It was at once noticed that men in
                    considerable numbers were going up the pike to the front, and others were
                    galloping about in excitement. I rode across at full speed, and coming up to an
                    infantry soldier asked what was the matter. He said, "Sheridan has just ridden
                    up the pike. I guess there'll be no more retreat today." In at few minutes I met
                    Thony Forsythe, Sheridan's chief of staff, who told me to go as quick as I could
                    to Newtown, form a guard, and bring up every man I could. All along the road
                    were abundant signs of panic,-guns without caissons, abandoned wagons, and
                    stragglers by hundreds. In about two hours I brought up nearly three thousand
                    men, all disorganized, but ready to join their colors now. Sheridan, once up
                    with the troops, stopped the retreat, re-formed his line of battle, rode along
                    the lines saying at few words here and there, and about half an hour before
                    sundown made a general attack, furious and successful at all points. Early's men
                    made a fierce resistance, but were charged by infantry and cavalry, and were
                    soon in complete rout, followed by our cavalry, who pursued them as far as
                    Fisher's Hill, capturing a great quantity of prisoners and material of all
                    sorts. Three times (in the three large battles of this campaign) the critical
                    point of the battle came just at sundown, and night came to Early's aid. It is a
                    fact that on each occasion his army was demoralized, and at the mercy of
                    Sheridan had daylight lasted. At Winchester, Fisher's Hill, and Cedar Creek the
                    final attack was of so impetuous a nature, that Early's men were literally
                    "whirled up the valley." Here, too, the excellent roads, flanked com-monly by open fields, helped his retreat. Such defeats in Eastern Virginia
                    would have meant annihilation. Early's troops, admirable at all points, were
                    especially strong in marching; the same could be said of the Confederate army
                    generally. They marched habitually with no stragglers and with great rapidity;
                    and they subsisted on food which would have demoralized a Union army, and could
                    fight like heroes on an empty stomach. Fisher's Hill and darkness as usual saved
                    Early's army. Early's generals all were brave men, but one deserves especial
                    mention,-General Ramseur, of North Carolina, who commanded a division in this
                    campaign. On several occasions he was very conspicuous; but this evening, when
                    the final attack was made, and his troops became unsteady, he rode out alone a
                    distance in front of them between the lines, encouraging his men by word and
                    example. It was not the only time he had been seen to do the same thing, but
                    here it cost him his life. He fell mortally wounded, and later was brought to
                    Sheridan's head-quarters, where everything was done that was possible to render
                    him comfortable, General Custer, a classmate at West Point, being especially
                    attentive. He died during the night. General Sheridan that night slept where his
                    heads-quarters had been in the morning. The old Hite House was full of wounded
                    and dying men, friends and foes, and slippery with blood, and the dead lay thick
                    around.</p>
<p>The next few days the trophies were collected on the plain in front of
                    head-quarters: forty-nine guns, fifty-two caissons, many thousand of small-arms,
                    with a great quantity of army wagons and ambulances, and about eleven hundred
                    prisoners and five or six stand of colors. The number of prisoners was but a
                    small part of all captured, as hundreds escaped in the darkness.</p>
<p>This battle ended the campaign, and soon after, on the plan of fortification
                    being abandoned, the army withdrew to Winchester, and the sixth corps went to
                    Petersburg. Numerous engagements also took place besides those mentioned. Our
                    cavalry were almost always marching and fighting, and distinguished themselves
                    greatly. In fact, during this campaign the Confederate cavalry maybe said to
                    have received their death blow. Towards the last they were quite unable to stand
                    up before our horsemen. Even Mosby lost his artillery.</p>
<p>In the eleven weeks front the date of Sheridan's taking command to the battle of
                    Cedar Creek he fought three battles, and almost daily some smaller affair,
                    capturing during that time eighty-nine cannon and over nine thousand prisoners
                    from the Confederate army, defeating them in every engagement, except that
                    morning at Cedar Creek. Sheridan's army was numerically largely superior to
                    Early's, but the campaign would have been otherwise impossible. Mosby, with
                    sixteen hundred men and guns, was always on his flank, besides other guerrilla
                    bands. As he advanced he was obliged to garrison the larger towns, and his wagon
                    trains had to be very strongly guarded to keep up his line of communication and
                    supply, which at times extended from Harper's Ferry and Martinsburg to Staunton.</p>
<p>Until "Winchester" he kept strictly on the defensive, according to instructions,
                    merely marching up and down to keep Early's attention occupied; but when the
                    word was given to take the offensive he displayed a wonderful activity. At
                    head-quarters it was always a wonder how he could do his work; apparently he
                    never slept, and during a battle or march he never had a tent or head-quarters
                    established except where occasion called him. His staff passed a score of nights
                    in the saddle, the only opportunity to lie down being in the dust or mud of a
                    road during, a temporary halt.</p>
<p>In a battle he was everywhere, and saw everything for himself. At Fisher's Hill
                    victory would have been otherwise impossible. At Cedar Creek it was his personal presence that turned that disaster into so brilliant a
                    victory. Usually retired and reticent, he would, during a battle, become ablaze
                    with enthusiasm. He was always affable, and would hear what one had to say; but
                    woe to the officer who displeased him. Doing his own full duty, he expected the
                    same from all under him, and he got it too; and therein lay his strength. He had
                    no favorites but the men who best carried out his orders. His orders to Torbert
                    on the morning of the Woodstock races were characteristic, and what happened at
                    Five Forks in putting Griffin in command of the fifth corps was to be expected
                    of him.</p>
<p>He became as thin as a greyhound during the campaign. He always wore his
                    major-general's uniform, and with it the dignity of the position. He was the
                    beau ideal of a general. He rode two horses, a gray and a black; both very
                    large, powerful, and fleet animals. The former was said to have belonged to
                    General Breckenridge, and to have been captured in one of the Western battles.
                    Both horses had a peculiar Kentucky gait,-something between a walk and a
                    trot,-which caused no little anguish to, and frequent strong language in quiet
                    from, his staff, who to keep up were obliged to take that exasperating gait, a
                    jog-trot. When this was continued nearly all day, the effect, good perhaps for
                    the digestion, was anything but soothing to the physique and temper. On the 19th
                    of October the black was the horse ridden, and the popular chromo, Sheridan's
                    Ride, gives an excellent idea of the horse, except that the horse, in proportion
                    to his rider, was really far larger.</p>
<p>Much has been said in the newspapers about Sheridan's profanity, and one might
                    really suppose he had studied in some Falstaffian school. I can only say I did
                    not notice it. When the emergency required it (and sometimes strong language was
                    felt to be not only a relief but a necessity) he could, like many men in all
                    callings of life, rise to the occasion in language as in deed; but I never
                    observed any peculiar profanity in the man, while usually he was not only
                    moderate in the quality but particularly so in the quantity of his language.</p>
<p>It is but fair to say that some officers of the sixth corps staff state that
                    before (and it is only claimed that it was <u>just</u>
                    before) Sheridan came up General Wright had issued orders for the army to
                    advance. But it is certain that it <u>had not
                    advanced</u>, and that it was in retreat when Sheridan rode up the pike.</p>
<p>The eighth corps took no part worth mentioning in the battle of Cedar Creek after
                    the surprise of the morning. What fighting was done up to the final attack was
                    by the first and second divisions (the first especially) of the sixth corps (the
                    whole corps handled with great ability by General Getty), which had had a very
                    severe fight just to the right of Middletown early in the day. All the rest of
                    the fighting until Sheridan gave the order for the final attack was desultory,
                    our troops slowly giving ground, and obliquing towards the pike and our rear.</p>
<p>The surprise of the morning gave Early the command of the pike. Why he did not
                    force his troops down that fine road, which for two miles, being on a ridge,
                    commanded all the country round it, is a mystery. It was worse than folly. Not a
                    man in blue for over an hour was on that road; it led to our rear, and would
                    have cut us off from our base and from reinforcements, and compelled our troops
                    to retreat by the bark road.</p>
<p>Some rebel cavalry were for a time in Middletown. With a guard of thirteen of our
                    scouts in rebel uniform, about an hour after the surprise, I rode into the town,
                    and sat watching the men in gray, expecting to see the head of a column of
                    Early's men each minute. Just afterwards Wheaton's division came up, and opened
                    his fight with the enemy. Riding towards our right, away from the pike, I came
                    upon our cavalry, Torbert in command, who rode rapidly towards me, awaiting
                    orders. He said he had his men all ready, but did not know what had taken place,
                    and had revived no orders whatever all the morning from  any one. I
                    briefly gave him the news, and advised him to lose no time in gaining the pike
                    and holding it, which he at once did. In the final attack and victory our
                    cavalry held the left along the pike. The fields were open and fenced with
                    stone-wall, and Kershaw's division of Longstreet's corps defended the line. It
                    is needless to say the fighting was desperate while it lasted. Our cavalry
                    mounted, and charged the choicest infantry of the Confederate army in open
                    country across stone-walls, and did it successfully. Here fell, mortally
                    wounded, General Charles R. Lowell (then Colonel Lowell, commanding reserve
                    brigade of cavalry), who died the next morning in Middletown. No man ever
                    distinguished himself more in a short time than this brave and accomplished
                    officer.</p>
<p>All the battles in the valley were in an open country, with few fences and good
                    roads. It was a frequent remark with officers that they "never saw a battle
                    before." Here the whole field lay before them like the stage of a theatre. The scenery was wonderfully beautiful, the
                    weather perfect, and the whole campaign exciting and full of incident. I think
                    those who went through it will always recall it with pleasure (if war can ever
                    be called pleasant). Certainly, if not the most successful, it was the most
                    brilliant campaign of the war.</p>
<p>The Battle of Winchester caused gold to fall from 230 to 191.</p>
<p>In closing I wish to state that this article has been written entirely without
                    consulting General Sheridan, and without his knowledge.</p>
