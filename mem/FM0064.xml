                <p>1st. All soldiers, Provost Marshals, Deputy Provost Marshals and Enrolling

                <p>Heirs of Prisoners of War are entitled to commutation for rations at twenty-five
                    cents per pay, for the time the soldier was held prisoner. The heirs are, first

                    if neither of these are living, then the brothers and sisters.</p>
                <p>ENTITLED TO EXTRA PAY.</p>
                <p>All officers who were in commission March 8, 1865, and who were discharged after
                    April 9, 1865, are entitled to three months (extra) pay proper, where that <hi
                        rend="underline">have</hi> not received it.</p>
                <p>ENTITLED TO PAY.</p>
                <p>All who have not been paid in full.</p>
                <p>All officers who after being commissioned actually entered on duty as such
                    commissioned officers, and for reasons beyond their control, were not mustered
                    as such for the 30 days or more, are entitled to full pay for the time they were
                    so serving as such officers.</p>
                <p>Members of the 1st Iowa Cavalry are entitled to pay from date of enrollment to

                <p>ENTITLED TO LAND WARRANTS.</p>
                <p>All who served in any of the wars from 1790 to March 3, 1855, one minute in
                    battle or 14 days in camp or elsewhere are entitled to a 160 acre land warrant.
                    Where the soldier is dead, the widow, where there is no widow, those who were
                    minor children (under 21) March 3, 1855, are entitled, providing the soldier did
                    not receive it.</p>
                <p>There is no law giving bounty land to soldiers of the late war, but Congress will
                    probably pass a law for their benefit.</p>
                <p>SOLDIERS DISCHARGED FOR WOUNDS.</p>
                <p>There are soldiers all over the country who were discharged for wounds received
                    in line of duty. These soldiers are entitled to the full amount of bounty,
                    originally promised by the Government. If soldiers did not receive the full
                    amount at the time of discharge, or have not received it since, they should
                    employ a competent attorney or claim agent to procure it for them.</p>
                <p>Heirs of all such soldiers are entitled to the bounty where the soldier has died
                    since discharge.</p>
                <p>HEIRS TAKE NOTICE</p>
                <p>That where a soldier was discharged on account of disease contracted in service,
                    and afterwards died of such disease, the widow, minor children, or parents, are
                    entitled to $100 by an act of July 28, 1866, if such soldier did not receive any
                    bounty or not, more than $100 from the United States.</p>
                <p>SOLDIER'S WIDOWS.</p>
                <p>There are many who have been drawing pensions who do not know that the children
                    under 16 years of age are entitled to pension on the remarriage of the widow.
                    All such should procure the pensions due the little ones.</p>
                <p>LOST DISCHARGES.</p>
                <p>Soldiers who have lost their discharges are entitled to bounty, and it can be
                    procured for them in all cases in which they would have been entitled if the
                    discharge had not been lost.</p>
                <p>CONGRESS has enacted that the pension money withheld from widows on account of
                    their children being in Orphan Homes should be paid to them.</p>
                <p>SOLDIERS who enlisted for three months are not entitled to bounty under present
                    laws.</p>
                <p>BY LATE LAW, Pensions date back to time of discharge if claims were filed within
                    five years. Those who did not receive pension from date of discharge are
                    entitled to it now.</p>
                <p>SOLDIERS' WIDOWS who have been so unfortunate as to marry bigamists, after the
                    death of their husand who served in the army can have their pensions
                renewed.</p>
