<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> This is a brief review of the soon-to-be-published second volume of Alexander
                    Stephens' Civil War narrative. Its appearance in the newspaper shows Franklin
                    County's continuing interest in the Civil War and specifically in ex-Confederate
                    perspective.</p>
<p>We are in possession of advance sheets of the second volume of Alexander H.
                    Stephens' great work on the war and are authorized by the publishers, the <u>National Publishing</u> Company, 26 South Seventh
                    Street, Philadelphia, Pa., to state that the
                    work will soon be issued.</p>
<p>Judging from the matter before us the work will likely keep up its interest to
                    the general reader. Like all Confederates, Mr. Stephens insists on the
                    supposition that the Great Chieftain, "Stonewall" Jackson fell by a mistaken
                    shot from his own men. The narration of the visit of Francis P. Blair, Sr., when he made his appearance in the Confederate
                    Capital in 1865, and when the celebrated Hampton Roads Confederence originated,
                    is full of interest. Blair, it will be remembered, attracted great attention at
                    Richmond, at that time. The writer says:-The arrival of this distinguished
                    personage, who was, unquestionably, the master spirit-the real <u>Warwick</u>-of the Party then in power at Washington,
                    caused no little sensation. What could have brought him there? And what was his
                    business? These were the inquiries of almost every one. He was immediately in
                    close and private consultation with Mr. Davis." The interview, says Mr.
                    Stephens, excited great curiosity and comment at the time, and he proceeds to
                    give a detailed and interesting account of it. But it is out of the question for
                    us to do justice to the work by giving extracts here and there of what occurred.</p>
<p>We understand that the work is sold only by subscription, and an agent is wanted
                    in every county.</p>
