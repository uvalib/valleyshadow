                            Prepared by an Officer, and Sold for the Benefit of the Franklin County
                            Soldiers' Monumental Association," by Unknown, 1869</h3>
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> This regimental history follows the 126th Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers
                    (composed mostly of Franklin County men) from its formation in summer 1862,
                    through its heavy losses on the heights of Fredericksburg and at
                    Chancellorsville, to the end of its term of service in May 1863. The author also
                    relates the story of Frances Day, a woman who joined the regiment disguised as a
                    man in order to follow a soldier she loved, and describes the great rancor
                    aroused in the regiment by a dispute over the required purchase of costly
                    dress-coats. Numerous other persons and incidents are mentioned as well.</p>
<p>On the 8th of July, 1862, the Peninsular Campaign came to a disastrous close.
                    McClellan was at Harrison's Landing. The siege of Richmond was raised. Fifteen
                    thousand men had been lost to the army in the fruitless struggle. That grand
                    army, which was the pride and hope of the country and which had fought its way
                    to the gates of the Rebel Capital, had staggered back in a seven days' combat to
                    the banks of the James river. The North was stunned with grief and despair.</p>
<p>Halleck was made General-in-Chief. On the 14th of July, Pope took command of the
                    Army of Virginia. On the 17th, the President was authorized to accept the
                    services of one hundred thousand volunteers for nine months to serve as
                    infantry, for whom the same provision was made as for volunteers for three
                    years, except as to bounty. At the same time arrangements were made to set in
                    motion the terrible machinery of the draft. The President approved the
                    Confiscation and Emancipation Act. The Nation was beginning to adopt stringent
                    and energetic measures. On the 31st of July, all leaves of absence were revoked
                    and annulled, and all officers and privates capable of service were required to
                    join their commands. During the  first week of August, the
                    Confederate Generals were assembling their forces for the purpose of crushing
                    the army commanded by General Pope and advancing to the capture of the Capital.
                    On the 9th of August, Jackson fought Banks at Cedar Mountain.</p>
<p>Such was the aspect of military affairs in the East whilst the One Hundred and
                    Twenty-Sixth regiment was recruiting. About three weeks were occupied in this
                    labor. Juniata county furnished two companies, namely: F and I. Captain John P.
                    Wharton, of Perryville, led the men of Company F, and those of I came in charge
                    of Captain Amos H. Martin, of Mifflintown. Both these officers were men of
                    mature years and sterling character, and the young men who followed them from
                    the banks of the Blue Juniata were the flower and promise of the county.</p>
<p>The remaining eight companies were from Franklin county, except part of one
                    company, which was furnished by Fulton. Doebler gathered around him, in Company
                    A, the young men of Chambersburg; and here also Miles and John H. Reel assembled
                    companies G and D. Brownson led down C from Mercersburg. The mountaineers of
                    Fulton, under Pott and Hoke, uniting with the men of Antrim collected by Wm. H.
                    Davison, formed Company B, under Austin. Waynesboro' sent out E, under the
                    Walkers. From the highlands of Path Valley, John H. Walker was followed by the
                    bulk of Company H, Elder filling out the complement with St. Thomas'
                    contribution. The quota of Greencastle marched out as Company K, under Rowe and
                    A. R. Davison. The materiel of these companies was also excellent. The very pick
                    and pride of Franklin county responded to the call of the President at this
                    great crisis of the struggle. The towns and the hill-sides of the Conococheague
                    sent of their best youth. A fair proportion of the officers had seen service and
                    learned the rudiments of drill and discipline in the school of actual
                    hostilities.  This regiment, made up so largely of the citizens of
                    Franklin county, was always regarded with pride by her people as her peculiar
                    contribution to the war.</p>
<p>The several companies of which the regiment was composed assembled at Camp Curtin
                    between the 6th and 10th of August, 1862. These having been duly mustered into
                    service, an election for field officers was held in camp on the 13th of August -
                    the electors being the company officers. This election was without legal force,
                    and merely served to indicate to the Governor the wishes of the regiment in this
                    regard. James G. Elder, of St. Thomas, Franklin county, who had been captain of
                    company C, Second regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers, (three months service) was
                    elected Colonel. Captain John Dick, of the One Hundred and Seventh Pennsylvania
                    Volunteers, then serving with his regiment in the field, was elected Lieutenant
                    Colonel, and D. Watson Rowe, late First Lieutenant of Company C, Second P.V.,
                    was chosen Major. The selection of Captain Dick was due to the desire of the
                    regiment to have the aid of an experienced soldier, but the regulations of the
                    War Department, at the time, prohibited officers of three-years regiments from
                    being transferred to nine-months organizations, (as was said,) and the Governor
                    accordingly commissioned James G. Elder as Colonel, D. Watson Rowe as Lieutenant
                    Colonel, and James C. Austin, who had been voted for as Lieutenant Colonel, to
                    be Major. At the same time, John Stewart was commissioned as Adjutant, and T.
                    Jefferson Nill as Quartermaster.</p>
<p>On the next day, the men having been supplied with arms and clothing, and the
                    companies furnished with camp and garrison equipage, the order to proceed to the
                    front was received by Colonel Elder, and at 4 A.M. of Friday, the 15th of
                    August, tents were struck, and the commissions of the Field and Staff Officers
                    being now handed to them, the regiment was conveyed by car to Baltimore and
                    thence to  Washington, where it arrived at 4 A.M. of the succeeding
                    day. Remaining at the Soldiers' Rest until noon, the march was then taken up for
                    the south side of the Potomac, and at 6 P.M., tents were pitched near Fort
                    Albany, about five miles from the city, a beautiful location, which was named
                    Camp Stanton. General Casey was here in command of the provisional brigades, and
                    to him reports were made. At this time the Surgeons joined the regiment and the
                    Non-Commissioned Staff were appointed. From this camp, on the 22nd of August,
                    the command was moved to Alexandria, and thence four miles out to Mrs. Scott's
                    house, near Clouds' Mills. The regiment was now brigaded with the Ninety-First,
                    One Hundred and Twenty-Ninth, and One Hundred and Thirty-Fourth Pennsylvania
                    Volunteers, commanded respectively by Colonels Gregory, Frick and O'Brien.
                    Brigadier-General Erastus B. Tyler was assigned to the command of the brigade.
                    No change took place in the brigade organization whilst the One Hundred and
                    Twenty-Sixth was in service, and General Tyler remained in command until the
                    term of service of the regiments had expired. Here the regiment was fully
                    supplied with ammunition and transportation, and began regular drill. It was
                    ready for work. Major Hershberger, of Chambersburg, went down to the front and
                    instituted a school for officers, which was kept up until the result of the
                    second Bull Run necessitated active movements of the command.</p>
<p>On the 23d of August, orders were received by Colonel Elder to be in readiness to
                    proceed to Warrenton; but, for some reason, the regiment was not moved. On the
                    26th, indeed, the baggage was loaded and sent off, but the men remained in camp,
                    and in the afternoon again pitched tents. On Sunday, the 31st of August, orders
                    came at 8 P.M., directing Lieutenant Colonel Rowe to prepare to proceed with six
                    companies of the One Hundred and Twenty-Sixth and a section of artillery to Bull
                    Run bridge and hold it.  The companies were called out, a train of
                    cars with the artillery aboard stood ready near by. At 11 P.M. Colonel Rowe was
                    ordered to Alexandria for final directions, but the order to move did not come,
                    for the tide of battle had already passed the point designated, and the bridge
                    was destroyed. On this day, companies A and B were sent seventeen miles to the
                    front in charge of an ammunition train, and Company K was also sent to Fairfax
                    Station to guard and care for the wounded there collected. The deep booming of
                    cannon had now, for several days, warned the regiment of the fearful struggle
                    daily drawing nearer, and at length the streams of wounded and stragglers
                    revealed only too clearly that a second time, on the field of Bull Run, the
                    banners of the Union had trailed before the foe.</p>
<p>On the 2nd of September, the whole army was drawn back within the lines around
                    Washington, and the One Hundred and Twenty-Sixth was moved to a position one
                    mile from Alexandria, named Camp Wade, between two Forts. Here, on Saturday, the
                    6th of September, Reverend Samuel J. Niccolls, appointed Chaplain to the
                    regiment, joined it, and the Commissioned Staff was thus made full.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the 7th, a long and tiresome march was made from this camp to Fort
                    Corcoran, up the river, and back again to Camp Whipple beside Fort Richardson,
                    where tents were pitched in a peach-orchard. At 6 1/2 in the evening divine
                    service was held by Reverend Mr. Niccolls, the chaplain, before head-quarters.
                    At that hour, unknown to the men, the whole rebel army had crossed the Potomac
                    and were settling around Frederick.</p>
<p>At this place the regiment learned of the dismissal from the service of Major
                    Austin, on the 5th of September, for visiting Washington without leave, contrary
                    to General Orders, No. 114. Major Austin had been very sick of a severe chronic
                    disease, and ignorant, like the rest, of the order referred to, went to the city
                    and placed himself in charge  of a physician there from August 28th
                    till September 3d, when he rejoined the regiment. This summary dismissal was
                    subsequently, upon a better understanding of the matter, revoked and Major
                    Austin restored, but he then resigned. He accompanied the regiment, however, to
                    Antietam.</p>
<p>It was whilst lying in this camp, a portion of the regiment in the rifle-pits,
                    and the remainder on picket at Bailey's Cross-Roads, near Munson's Hill, every
                    one supposing the enemy to be in full force in front of Washington, and an
                    assault upon the fortifications daily expected, that a flood of letters from
                    Franklin county first informed the men of Lee's invasion of Maryland, and that
                    their hearths and altars were threatened. A very deep feeling pervaded the
                    entire regiment. Every one pondered the situation, and endeavored to divine the
                    near future. While thus the letters came in from the 8th until the 11th, showing
                    with each day an increase of excitement at home; while Lee was issuing his
                    proclamations to Maryland, and McClellan was marching in five parallel columns
                    on Frederick; the men of the One Hundred and Twenty-Sixth picketed and drilled,
                    and lounged and smoked in the works around Washington, the monotony broken only
                    by a review on the 9th by Gene- Fitz John Porter and
                    General Whipple. But the afternoon of Friday, the 12th, found the brigade of
                    Tyler marching through Georgetown and Washington to Meridian Hill, at the foot
                    of 14th street in the latter city, whence began, on Sunday, the 14th of
                    September, the march for the battle field of Antietam.</p>
<p>Before we follow the regiment from Washington a bit of romance connected with its
                    history is to be chronicled. William Fitzpatrick, of Western Virginia, loved or
                    was loved by Frances Day. Fitzpatrick enlisted in company F, from Juniata
                    county, and went to the war with the One Hundred and Twenty-Sixth regiment. In a
                    short time he fell ill,  and on the 24th of August, 1862, whilst the
                    regiment lay at Cloud's Mills, he died in the hospital at Alexandria. On the day
                    he died, Frank Maine, a Sergeant of company F, unaccountably deserted. When he
                    enlisted he was a stranger to all the men of that company, but in a few days he
                    had so ingratiated himself with his comrades and officers as to be promoted to
                    Sergeant. He was not heard of any more while the regiment remained in service.
                    But long after, in the far West, a soldier, wounded badly in a great battle,
                    could not conceal her sex, and Frances Day then told how she had followed
                    Fitzpatrick into the army and become herself a soldier and a Sergeant in the One
                    Hundred and Twenty-Sixth Pennsylvania Volunteers; of her desertion upon her
                    lover's death, and the abandon and despair which led her to seek again the ranks
                    of the army. To verify her story, letters were written to the officers of
                    Company F, at Mifflintown, and thus the mystery of the Sergeant's desertion was
                    dispelled.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Sept. 14th, the regiment marched with the brigade from the Camp at
                    Meridian Hill for the Monocacy, by way of Rockville, encamping by that stream on
                    the afternoon of the 16th, about the time Hooker's corps was first put in motion
                    on the field of Antietam, and the great battle began. On the first day's march,
                    General Humphreys with his staff was observed on the roadside, snatching a
                    marching review of the brigade as it passed by en route, and it was then learned
                    that a day or two before he had been assigned to the division composed of the
                    brigades of Tyler and Allabach. He remained at the head of this division until
                    the muster out of the regiments composing it. Of these two officers, Tyler and
                    Humphreys, who together had sole charge of the fortunes of this regiment,
                    General Humphreys was a Regular officer, past middle life, educated at West
                    Point, deeply learned in engneering, long attached to the Topographical
                    Department, and so far, during the  war, on the staff of General
                    McClellan. He entered the service on the lst of July, 1831, as Brevet Second
                    Lieutenant, in the Second Artillery. Served in Florida: resigned 30th September,
                    1836: was appointed First Lieutenant of Topographical Engineers, July 7th, 1838.
                    He knew little of human nature in civilians, and when he first assumed command
                    of this division he was not well fitted to handle citizen volunteers.
                    Nevertheless, he was greatly relied upon. General Tyler, on the other hand, was
                    not an educated soldier, but full of military spirit and aptitude, and admirably
                    suited to have charge of a brigade of men fresh from the people. He was heartily
                    liked by all under him, and was as much respected as liked. He was a large,
                    soldierly-looking man, in the prime of life. He entered the army at the outbreak
                    of the war as Colonel of the Seventh Ohio, and served under Rosecrans in West
                    Virginia. He subsequently fought by the side of Shields in the Valley, when
                    Stonewall Jackson was there. The regiment was fortunate in both its general
                    officers.</p>
<p>Tyler's brigade lay on the Monocacy, by the Frederick road, from the evening of
                    the 16th till the middle of the afternoon of the 17th of September, during which
                    time a large body of paroled Union prisoners, surrendered by Miles at Harper's
                    Ferry, passed southward. About 3 o'clock the march was taken up for Antietam, by
                    way of Frederick, Middletown and Boonsboro, and the command was forced forward
                    all night, halting but one hour on the top of South Mountain for rest, and at 8
                    A.M. of the 18th arrived on the battle field, received twenty additional rounds
                    of ammunition, and took position in reserve with the rest of Porter's corps. The
                    men were much fatigued with the twenty-six miles forced marching, but were in
                    good heart at the prospect of making their first fight near home. The
                    reinforcement which Humphreys thus brought to M'Clellan numbered six thousand
                    men. The fight was not resumed. Lee  crossed the Potomac. Tyler's
                    brigade was moved down to the river bank and watched the enemy on the other side
                    all day, while an Ohio battery amused them with an occasional shell. The brigade
                    went into camp one mile from Sharpsburg, where it lay without a movement worthy
                    of note until the 16th of October. The One Hundred and Twenty-Sixth regiment,
                    raised on the border, was over-overflowed all the while it lay here with friends
                    and relatives, who came in great numbers, bearing loads of provisions and
                    delicacies. The State Colors were presented here, and the division was honored
                    with a review by the President of the United States.</p>
<p>On the 16th of October, General Humphreys, with his division and some artillery
                    and cavalry, made a reconnoisance into
                    Virginia, crossing the Potomac below Shepherdstown and proceeding as far as
                    Leetown. The enemy's cavalry hovered in the Federal front all the way, and his
                    horse-artillery were kept pretty busily at work. He fell back, however, without
                    showing much resistance, and the casualties were few. The reconnoitering force
                    encamped over night near Leetown, and next day retraced its steps and recrossed
                    the river, the movement having been very finely conducted by General Humphreys.
                    After this, for two weeks, the time passed as before - in guard, drill, parade
                    and review. The ladies of Waynesboro' relieved the monotony somewhat by the
                    presentation of a beautiful banner to Company E, many of the fair donors being
                    present.</p>
<p>At length, on the 30th of October, 1863, (M'Clellan having begun his movement on
                    Warrenton,) the regiment broke camp at 3 P.M., and moved about six miles into
                    Pleasant Valley. At day-break next day the march was resumed, the river at
                    Harpers' Ferry was crossed on pontoons, and the brigade halted four miles beyond
                    the Ferry, in Loudon county. On Sunday, 2nd of November, Snickersville was
                    reached and the regiment went into camp, but having only  had time
                    for supper, the march was continued after dark to the top of the mountain -
                    Snicker's Gap. Here, on the top of the Blue Ridge, the brigade lay until
                    Wednesday, the 5th. The weather was growing cold. The west winds whistled on the
                    mountain peaks and pierced to the marrow of the men's bones. But there were
                    compensations. The soldiers, living off the enemy, reveled in mutton and veal.
                    The enraptured vision of the pickets drank in the beauties of the Shenandoah
                    Valley, spread out like a great quilt beneath them - Berryville plainly in view,
                    and the distant spires of Winchester dimly visible.</p>
<p>From Snicker's Gap the command was moved towards Aldie, but when about four miles
                    from that place changed direction and passed through White Plains to New
                    Baltimore, and thence to the vicinity of Warrenton, where it lay encamped until
                    the 17th of November. Here M'Clellan, attended by Burnside, his successor in
                    command of the army, bade farewell to all the corps in a grand and brilliant
                    review. A day or two later, Fitz John Porter also reviewed the 5th Corps upon
                    taking leave of it - Hooker succeeding him. While here, the six corps of the
                    army were consolidated into three Grand Divisions of two corps each, and the
                    Fifth Corps, now under Butterfield, was assigned to the Center Grand Division,
                    which Hooker commanded. On Sunday, the 16th, Hooker reviewed Humphreys'
                    division, and the men began to know "Fighting Joe," and to take pride in him as
                    their commander. In the evening, Reverend Mr. Niccolls preached his farewell
                    sermon to the brigade, at General Tyler's headquarters. The leave of absence
                    granted him by the Presbyterian Congregation of Chambersburg had expired, and he
                    now resigned the chaplaincy and returned home.</p>
<p>On Monday, the 17th, the division began its march by way of Warrenton Junction
                    and Richland Creek to the vicinity of Falmouth. The weather was rainy, the
                    country  traversed poor and deserted, the rations short, and the
                    march, though the stages were not long, was altogether disagreeable. On the 19th
                    tents were pitched six miles from Fredericksburg, and on the 22d camp was
                    shifted to a point two miles nearer Falmouth. The coldness of the weather now
                    admonished the soldiers to build chimneys and otherwise promote physical comfort
                    in their tents, and the camp soon became a temporary village. Upon the arrival
                    of the regiment here, it was greeted with the return of Captain Reed and
                    Lieutenants Cook and Hornbaker and a number of enlisted men left sick at
                    Antietam.</p>
<p>At 4 A.M. of the 11th December, the reveille was beaten and the regiment moved
                    out to the field of its first great battle. It halted in a level plat about two
                    miles out. The next day it was moved forward a mile or two and bivouacked in a
                    pine woods near the Philips House, and close by the river. During both days the
                    men were inspired by the music of bands and the deep booming of Burnside's
                    cannon on the river bank. On Saturday, the 13th of December, the brigade crossed
                    the Rappahannock on the upper pontoon bridge, entered Fredericksburg at the
                    northern end, then turning to the left moved down to the centre of the town. At
                    3 1/2 P.M. General Tyler moved his command to the front, and filing to the right
                    from the Telegraph road, entered a low meadow, at the far end of which stood a
                    large brick tannery. Above this meadow, overshadowing it, frowned the rebel
                    redoubts and batteries. The command was massed in this enclosure - the Union and
                    Confederate batteries playing over the heads of the men. Very soon a rebel
                    officer was observed to advance a section, and immediately he opened on the
                    crowded mass beneath. The shell dropped down into the throng and threw the earth
                    and mangled bodies into the air. The men were not in line of battle - could not
                    form in line - were simply awaiting orders. They could only watch the battery on
                    the height above; watch  the flight of the shell into their midst,
                    and shudder at its destruction. It was awful to stand thus and be slaughtered.
                    But at length the order came to move to the left of the Telegraph road and form
                    in two lines under cover of a hill, preparatory to a last charge upon the rebel
                    works on Marye's Heights. The road was swept by the enemy's shell and the
                    bullets of his sharp-shooters. The right of the regiment was hurried across; the
                    left waited a moment at the edge of the road, then it also hastily passed over,
                    but not scathless. Lieutenant Fortescue, of G, had scarcely put foot into the
                    road before a ball from a sharp-shooter's rifle pierced his head and he fell a
                    corpse.</p>
<p>As rapidly as possible, for it was growing late, the column of assault was formed
                    in two lines. The first line was composed of the One Hundred and Thirty-Fourth
                    Pennsylvania, under Colonel O'Brien, on the right, and the One Hundred and
                    Twenty-Ninth Pennsylvania, Colonel Frick, on the left; the second line, six or
                    eight paces in the rear, was made up of the One Hundred and Twenty-Sixth
                    Pennsylvania, Colonel Elder, on the right, and the Ninety-First Pennsylvania,
                    Colonel Gregory, on the left.</p>
<p>While the brigade was thus forming, at the base of the hill, a battery above was
                    engaged in a fearful and desperate duel with the rebel artillery - their many
                    guns concentrating on it a converging fire. It was an unequal fight. The
                    artillery-men, black with powder and smoke, worked like fiends. Volunteers were
                    sent from the regiments below. In a short time the men were scattered about the
                    ground dead, and the guns were rendered useless or hauled off. At this moment
                    General Hooker and General Butterfield came out of town, and from an eminence a
                    short distance to the rear, prepared to watch the effect of Humphreys' charge.</p>
<p>The men were ordered to rely solely upon the bayonet and cautioned not to fire;
                    the command: "Officers, twelve paces to the front!" was given; the bugles
                    sounded the charge,  and then, with cheer upon cheer, the hill which
                    covered the formation was ascended and the charge began. The ranks were well
                    kept; the men ran steadily and in line. The brick house on Marye's Hill was
                    already reached. The evening was fine; it was just beginning to grow dark. This
                    was the fourth charge made that day over this same ground. Hancock had followed
                    French, and then Howard had gone up the hill. Each charge was repulsed after
                    fifteen immortal minutes. When the third charge failed, Burnside, riding down to
                    the Rappahannock, (the men of the One Hundred and Twenty-Sixth saw him pass,)
                    gazing over at those heights, exclaimed, "That crest must be carried tonight!"
                    Humphreys had been at once ordered across. So far he had done his work well. "No
                    prettier sight was ever seen," said Hooker, as he turned to leave the field
                    after the failure of the assault, "than the charge of that Division." General
                    Humphreys himself, a stern judge, who, brave to a fault, exacted much of the
                    soldiers under him and was little given to compliment, spoke highly of the
                    conduct of his command. General Tyler in his report extols their gallantry.
                    Harpers' Pictorial, a week after the charge, contained a large wood-cut
                    illustration of it. But it was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>In front of the brick house at the foot of the crest, and along the raised ground
                    to its right and left, lay a body of men in line prone on the earth. They were
                    the men of the last preceding charge. Whether they did not wish to be run over
                    by the men and the officers on horseback, or from whatever cause, they raised
                    partly up, cried halt, remonstrated with violent gesticulations as the charging
                    line came upon them, and thereby very greatly disarranged the ranks and broke
                    the force of the charge. But the column passed over them like a storm. Colonel
                    Elder led the right wing of the One Hundred and Twenty-Sixth to the right of the
                    brick house. Lieutenant Colonel Rowe sent part of the left wing, placed in his
                    charge, also to the right, and led  the two left companies, H and K,
                    around on the other side. These latter companies having a clear field pressed
                    rapidly beyond the house and quite near the stone wall, blazing now in the
                    evening with the enemy's fire. Colonel Elder, with those who went to the right
                    of the house, was greatly obstructed by fences in the way, which had to be
                    broken down. Nevertheless he pushed vigorously beyond the house and approached
                    the stone wall. As the house was passed on either side, the fire of musketry,
                    which was severe before, grew terrific. The long line of stone wall was a sheet
                    of flame. From every eminence, in front, to right, to left, the rebel cannon
                    were turned on the charging column. Whatever was to be done must be done
                    quickly. In one moment more the wall could be gained. How it came about is not
                    known, but certain it is that the men lying in front of the house, who had been
                    passed over, began to fire at the enemy through our advancing lines. Immediately
                    there was a stop. The fire in the front, the fire in the rear, every flash
                    visible in the twilight, astounded the soldiers. Bewildered, they stood for a
                    moment irresolute; then in their excitement began to fire at the rebel line.
                    This was fatal. The charge was over. All its momentum was lost. It was folly to
                    thick of leading men leisurely up to that blazing fence; it was more hopeless
                    still to expect them to stand still and remain enduring that fire. The officers
                    urged. Colonel Elder, gallantly pushing forward, fell badly wounded. General
                    Tyler was struck on the breast with a piece of shell. General Humphreys already
                    had two horses killed under him, and was raving in front of the lines - urging
                    the men on whilst pulling his holsters from under his dead horse. Among the line
                    officers of the One Hundred and Twenty-Sixth, Doebler, Pott, Wharton, Walker,
                    Fletcher, and Mackey, had been carried from the field. Men were falling rapidly.
                    Their feeble fire against the stone wall was futile. It was growing dark.
                    Lieutenant Colonel Rowe  was on the left of the regiment, on the
                    other aide of the house, ignorant that Colonel Elder had fallen. The regiment
                    was without a Major. It fell back with the rest of the brigade to the protection
                    of the house, and descending the acclivity up which the charge had been made,
                    re-formed under the cover of the hill whence the charge began.</p>
<p>Of the character of the work which this division was put to do, and of the
                    behavior of the men who followed Humphreys up those heights on that December
                    evening, General Hooker speaks thus, under oath a week afterward, before the
                    Committee on the Conduct of the War; and he who won on many a bloody field the
                    sobriquet of "Fighting Joe," must be supposed no mean judge of a brilliant
                    charge:</p>
<p>Major General JOSEPH HOOKER, sworn and examined.*</p>
<p>"About 2 o'clock, on that day, [December 13th,] I received orders to send another
                    of my divisions to support General Sturgis, and about the same time I received
                    an order from General Burnside to cross over my other two divisions and attack
                    the enemy on the Telegraph road - the same position we had been butting against
                    all day long. As soon as I received the order my divisions commenced crossing.</p>
<p>"I rode forward to see what I could learn from the officers - French, Wilcox,
                    Couch, and Hancock - who had been engaged in the attack. Their opinion, with one
                    exception, was that the attack should not be made on that point. After
                    conferring with them I went to examine the position to see whether or not it
                    could be turned. Discovering no weak point, and seeing that many of the troops
                    that had already been engaged in the attack were considerably demoralized, and
                    fearing that should the enemy make an advance, even of but a small column,
                    nothing but disaster would follow, I sent my Aid-de-camp to General Burnside to
                    say that I advised him not to attack at that place. He returned, saying that the
                    attack must be made. I had the matter so much at heart that I put spurs to my
                    horse and rode over here, [the Lacy House, where the committee were sitting,]
                    and tried to dissuade General Burnside from making the attack. He insisted on
                    its being made.</p>
<p>"I then returned and brought up every available battery in the city, with a view
                    to break away their barriers by the use of artillery. I proceeded against the
                    barriers as I would against a fortification and  endeavored to
                    breach a hole sufficiently large for a "forlorn hope" to enter. Before that, the
                    attack along the line, it seemed to me, had been too general - not suffciently
                    concentrated. I had two batteries posted on the left of the road, within four
                    hundred yards of the position upon which the attack was to be made, and I had
                    other parts of batteries posted on the right of the road at the distance of five
                    or six hundred yards. I had all these batteries playing with great vigor until
                    sunset upon that point, but with no apparent effect upon the rebels or upon
                    their works.</p>
<p>During the last part of the cannonading I had given directions to General
                    Humphreys' division to form, under the shelter which a small hill afforded, in
                    column for assault. When the fire of the artillery ceased I gave directions for
                    the enemy's works to be assaulted. General Humphreys' men took off their
                    knapsacks, overcoats and haversacks. They were directed to make the assault with
                    empty muskets, for there was no time there to load and fire. When the word was
                    given the men moved forward with great impetuosity. They ran and hurrahed, and I
                    was encouraged by the great good feeling that pervaded them. The head of General
                    Humphreys' column advanced to within, perhaps, fifteen or twenty yards of the
                    stone wall, which was the advanced position which the rebels held - and then
                    they were thrown back as quickly as they had advanced. Probably the whole of the
                    advance and the retiring did not occupy fifteen minutes. They left behind, as
                    was reported, seventeen hundred and sixty of their number, out of about four
                    thousand.</p>
<p>"I may as well state here that Sykes' division was drawn up to support Humphreys,
                    so that in case he should succeed, I could throw forward all the force that I
                    had left - Sykes' division, about four thousand men - to hold the position in
                    face of thirty thousand who were massed behind that wall. That was why I did not
                    like to make the attack, because even if successful, I could not hold the
                    position. It was now just dark. Finding that I had lost as many men as my orders
                    required me to lose, I suspended the attack, and directed that the men should
                    hold, for the advance line between Fredericksburg and the enemy, a ditch that
                    runs along about midway between the enemy's lines and the city, which would
                    afford a shelter for the men.</p>
<p>"I will say that, in addition to the musketry fire that my men were exposed to,
                    the crests of the hills surrounding Fredericksburg form almost a semi-circle,
                    and these were filled with artillery, and the focus was the column that moved up
                    to this assault. That focus was within good canister range, though I do not
                    think any canister was thrown on my men that day. All those difficulties were
                    apparent and perfectly well known to me before I went into this assault.  They were known also to other officers. General French said to me
                    that the whole army could not take that point." * * *</p>
<p>Question. - Had you made any impression upon their works?</p>
<p>Answer. - Not the slightest; no more than you could make upon the side of a
                    mountain of rock. * * * * * *</p>
<p>Question. - How did the men behave during the attack?</p>
<p>Answer. - They behaved well. There never was anything more glorious than the
                    behavior of the men. NO CAMPAIGN IN THE WORLD EVER SAW A MORE GALLANT ADVANCE
                    THAN HUMPHREYS' MEN MADE THERE. But they were put to do a work that no men could
                    do."</p>
<p>Colonel Elder was carried from the spot where he fell to the brick house, and
                    after a while into Fredericksburg to the hospital, where he was placed in charge
                    of Doctor Nugent. His left leg near the thigh was fearfully shattered, and his
                    life for a time was despaired of. He was subsequently conveyed to Washington,
                    where he remained until the regiment was mustered out, the command of it
                    devolving, thenceforth, on the Lieutenant Colonel. The wounds of Captain Doebler
                    also prevented his return, and Lieutenant Welsh was in charge of Company A from
                    this time. During the charge the color-bearer of the One Hundred and
                    Thirty-Fourth regiment was shot; and the colors of that regiment were rescued
                    and safely brought off by George E. Jones, of Company H, One Hundred and
                    Twenty-Sixth, and returned by Lieutenant Colonel Rowe to the regiment. The
                    brigade went into action two thousand strong, and lost in the few minutes of the
                    charge, thirty-three officers and four hundred and twenty-three men.</p>
<p>About 9 o'clock at night the brigade was withdrawn from the field and rested in
                    the streets of the town. At 3 A.M., however, it was again taken under Colonel
                    Gregory to the scene of the evening's charge. Everything now was perfectly
                    quiet, not a gun broke the stillness of the night. The groans of the wounded
                    rang out clear in the night air. The ground was strewed with the dead and dying,
                    and the ambulances and stretcher-bearers flitted quickly and quietly over  the field. A deep mist obscured everything. Lieutenant Walker was
                    out with a party detailed for the purpose, seeking all night long the wounded
                    and dead of the One Hundred and Twenty-Sixth. Until daylight the regiment lay on
                    the ascent below the brick house. In the morning the brigade was relieved and
                    taken by General Tyler into Fredericksburg, the One Hundred and Twenty-Sixth
                    being quartered in a graveyard opposite the office of G.H.C. Rowe, Esq., which
                    was used as regimental headquarters. The 14th was Sunday. On the evening of the
                    15th, the One Hundred and Twenty-Sixth was posted as a strong picket along one
                    of the streets in the suburbs. From this duty it was subsequently taken, toward
                    midnight, and hurriedly conducted across the city and out to the left beyond the
                    limits of the town, across a stream and up a road to a small brick house. Here
                    four companies were held in reserve, and the remainder were posted on the edge
                    of a precipitous hill running in a semi-circle round to the railroad. The
                    enemy's pickets could be heard talking. The men crawled quietly to their places
                    and lay flat down, their guns pointing through the fence. Arrived at the
                    block-house, Lieutenant Colonel Rowe placed therein Captain Brownson, with a
                    dozen of his men, and sent Captain Walker with six of company E's men across to
                    the railroad. Just at this time the moon shone out brightly for a little while,
                    throwing long shadows down the hill, rendering what was doing observable to the
                    enemy. But fortunately the changing of the pickets was now accomplished. Soon,
                    however, it grew dark again and towards morning rained very hard. All night long
                    the army of Burnside had been busy seeking the North bank of the Rappahannock,
                    yet so quietly that not the rebels only but this regiment (except one or two
                    officers) knew nothing of it.</p>
<p>Toward daylight an order came to withdraw the command as speedily and cautiously
                    as possible. Colonel Rowe had  hardly begun to put this order in
                    execution before it was countermanded; and the men had to be put back. Then part
                    of a company of the Ninety-First under Captain Lentz, and also a body of
                    Berdan's sharpshooters were sent to him. Again the order came to withdraw, and
                    again it was countermanded by fast-riding aids-de-camp. The army was not yet
                    quite over the river. The Lieutenant Colonel was exceedingly fearful these
                    movements among the pickets would draw the attention of the enemy. It was a long
                    time growing light, but now at length it was broad-day, when, not too soon, the
                    order came to hasten to the bridges. The regiment was hastily collected
                    together. Lentz, with his men and the sharp-shooters, were to remain until the
                    One Hundred and Twenty-Sixth should begin to move down the road to town and then
                    fall in as skirmishers on the flank and rear. All this was happily executed
                    (with one oversight), and the regiment, double-quicking, entered the town, found
                    the lower bridge taken away, hastened to the upper bridge, without stopping for
                    the knapsacks which had been stored when about to proceed to the charge. This
                    bridge had also been swung out into the river, but was now put back, and the
                    regiment crossed over to the other side. Then the bridge was again cut loose and
                    Fredericksburg was abandoned by the Union. army. The One Hundred and
                    Twenty-Sixth was the last regiment to cross.</p>
<p>But Captain Lentz with six of his men was in the blockhouse. Lieutenant Bonsall,
                    of F, the officer sent to withdraw the pickets and convey the orders to Lentz,
                    had mistaken his lieutenant for him, and he was in utter ignorance of what was
                    doing. Here he remained some time alone (he and his six men) of all the army, in
                    front of the enemy. A rebel soldier, approaching cautiously, found six guns
                    suddenly thrust out at him, and surrendered. Brought into the block-house he
                    surprised Lentz with the news of the evacuation of Fredericksburg. Look-ing out he saw the Union line deserted and the rebels gathering
                    towards the block-house. He left suddenly with his prisoner, down the steep
                    hill, across the canal, through the edge of the town, the other end of which was
                    swarming with rebels, hid behind the abutment of the destroyed bridge, until a
                    gallant little fellow, a drummer, swam across for a skiff, which, brought back,
                    saved most of Lentz's party. The morning of the 16th the regiment breakfasted in
                    the pine woods where it had bivouacked the night of the 12th, and after noon
                    settled down in the former camp. It left camp with twenty-six officers and six
                    hundred and six men, but company I, having been detached as hospital guard, did
                    not participate in the action.</p>
<p>A few days after the battle of Fredericksburg, the Rev. John Ault joined the
                    regiment as Chaplain. He remained with it, however, only until the 18th of
                    January, when the mud-march was begun, at which time, being sick, he went home
                    on leave, and did not rejoin the command again until it arrived at Harrisburg
                    for muster-out. Until the mud-march the life in camp was monotonous and devoid
                    of excitement. The courts-martial of Lieutenants Cook and Hornbaker, of the One
                    Hundred and Twenty-Sixth, and afterwards of Colonels Frick and Armstrong, of the
                    One Hundred and Twenty-Ninth, which grew out of the dress-coat difficulty, alone
                    gave any zest to it. Lieutenants Cook and Hornbaker left the regiment at
                    Antietam after the battle, when the regiment was under orders to move, and went
                    home, sick, with the Surgeon's leave - but there was want of formality in
                    procuring the leaves of absence. Though both undoubtedly sick and wholly unfit
                    for duty in the field, they failed to send to the headquarters of the regiment
                    the certificates required by regulations and orders. They were accordingly found
                    guilty and dismissed, and left as the command started on the mud-march. The
                    dismissal of Lieutenant Cook, upon a full presentation of his case, was
                        after-wards, and after the muster out of the regiment, justly
                    revoked by order of the President. It is to his credit, that being under arrest
                    at the time of the battle of Fredericksburg, he asked permission to have his
                    sword and command restored in order to his taking part in the battle, which was
                    refused. Lieutenant Hornbaker made no effort to have his sentence reversed, but
                    subsequently entered the army as a private and effaced whatever stain there was
                    upon his record, if any, by his death on the field of battle.</p>
<p>The difficulty about the dress-coats, which was quite an episode in the life of
                    the regiment, was succinctly this: About the 10th of January, 1863, General
                    Humphreys issued an order that all the men should draw dress-coats. Now,
                    whatever clothing the men drew above a prescribed quantity, they were charged
                    with, and they were already amply provided with blouses and warm under-clothing.
                    Dress-coats were superfluous for comfort. This was represented to the Division
                    General, but he clung to his caprice, and the men refused to take the coats. The
                    regimental and company commanders were placed in an awkward position. The order
                    was arbitrary, but it was imperative. They finally refused to compel their men,
                    and were placed in arrest. They were, in the end, forced to yield and made the
                    necessary requisitions, and the men took the coats off their hands, but threw
                    them away, and the only effect of the order was to subtract several dollars from
                    each man's pay. The Colonel and Lieutenant Colonel of the One Hundred and
                    Twenty-Ninth remained contumacious, were placed in arrest, tried and dismissed
                    the service, but were restored again by the President, and wrote in their
                    vindication a book called "Red Tape and Pigeon Hole Generals."</p>
<p>But now the time had come for Burnside to move again. At 2 1/2 o'clock, P.M., of
                    Tuesday, the 20th of January, the brigade to which the One Hundred and
                    Twenty-Sixth was attached (Tyler's) marched out of camp and journeyed two  miles on the famous mud-march. Towards evening it began to rain and
                    continued to rain all night, sometimes with much violence. The men were
                    drenched; the roads were made dreadful. It rained the next day, during which the
                    command made some four miles. On the 22nd, the brigade lay in a woods where it
                    had encamped the night before. This day there was no forward movement. The
                    afternoon was employed in making corduroy road. There was no thought of going
                    ahead; how to get back was the question. Pontoon trains, wagons, guns,
                    ammunition trains, encumbered the roads. Horses and mules were everywhere
                    floundering in the mud. The soil, though tenacious, was without bottom. The
                    supply trains could not be brought up. The whole army, therefore, was put to
                    corduroying. Regiments could be seen coming across the country like moving
                    groves, every man carrying a tree top. So Birnam Wood once came to Dunsinane.</p>
<p>"Let every soldier hew him down a bough,<br>And bear 't before him."</p>
<p>Behind came others bearing the rails of rifled fences. The branches thrown into
                    the mud made a bed for the rails. Whole woods were cut down and thrown into the
                    road. On Friday, whiskey rations were issued to the command, and the same work
                    was continued. At length, on Saturday, the 24th, the brigade marched back over
                    the road it had helped to make to the former camp, and so the mud-march ended.
                    Burnside after this resigned, and Hooker became commander of the Army of the
                    Potomac. General Meade was assigned to the command of the Fifth Corps.</p>
<p>For three months all grand military operations ceased. In this interval, however,
                    the troops were constantly and energetically drilled and disciplined. The ranks
                    were filled up. Clothing was furnished, and excellent food in abundance. A
                    system of furloughs was instituted. From the 1st of February till the 1st of
                    May, the regiment daily grew better in physique and morale. </p>
<p>On Monday, the 2d of February, Tyler's brigade was transferred from the camp it
                    had hitherto occupied, near Falmouth, to another a mile or two further West,
                    where were greater conveniences of wood and water. The new location was a very
                    beautiful as well as advantageous one. The regiments were in the woods, on the
                    sides of gently eloping hills, at the foot of which ran a stream of clear water.
                    The One Hundred and Twenty-Sixth and One Hundred and Twenty-Ninth were placed
                    side by side and over against the Ninety-First and One Hundred and
                    Thirty-Fourth, on the other side of the stream. Brigade head-quarters were near
                    by, on a bluff, amidst cedars. This camp was the home of the regiment during the
                    remainder of its term of service. Three quiet months were passed here in picket
                    and drill, and inspection and parade; in eating, sleeping, smoking; in going to
                    camps, and hurdle-races and home (as to some); in drawing rations and washing,
                    and writing love-letters; in rollcalls and reviews; in camp and hospital guard,
                    and burials of the dead with muffled drum.</p>
<p>Among the occurrences of this time which excited a lively interest in the men of
                    the One Hundred and Twenty-Sixth regiment, was the presentation to General
                    Tyler, by the men and officers of his brigade, of a magnificent young horse,
                    named "Young Salem," of "Grey Eagle" stock, pure white, and superbly beautiful,
                    - bought in Ohio for a large sum, - together with the necessary trappings and
                    housings, and a splendidly mounted sword and spurs. The visit, also, of Governor
                    Andrew G. Curtin, in March, and the subsequent review by General Polardi, a
                    Swiss officer of rank, served to relieve the tedium of the days.</p>
<p>About the 25th of February, Stuart pressed back our cavalry out-posts, which
                    created some excitement in camp. The regiment was hastily forwarded to the
                    picket line, and kept under arms all night - a night which will remain long in
                    the memories of the men on duty. "It snowed and  blowed," said they
                    upon their return, "and we marched in a circle all night long through the snow
                    and mud to keep warm."</p>
<p>The 22d of February was duly observed by the firing of cannon in the morning,
                    which, naturally enough, was mistaken at first for a fierce attack by the enemy.
                    But the repose at head-quarters, and the absence of gay Aids hurrying with sharp
                    messages, quieted all such apprehensions. On this anniversary of the birth of
                    Washington, celebrated by the Army of the Potomac, in the midst of a great war
                    for the Union which he founded, an echo in every soldier's breast responded to
                    the loud acclaims of the deep-mouthed cannon.</p>
<p>At Head-Quarters of the Regiment: On the 25th of February, Lieutenant Colonel
                    Rowe was made President of a court-martial and military commission which sat at
                    the head-quarters of Allabach's brigade, and remained on this special duty until
                    the 17th of March, when he took command of the brigade for ten days. During this
                    period, Captain Andrew R. Davison, the senior captain present, commanded the
                    regiment. On the 31st of March, Captain Robert S. Brownson, of Company C, was
                    mustered in as Major, and assumed command as such. Adjutant John Stewart was
                    appointed by General Humphreys, on the 11th of April, Commissary of Musters for
                    the Third Division, Fifth Corps, and Lieutenant George F. Platt acted as
                    Adjutant thereafter. In April, Assistant Surgeon Grube was transferred to the
                    Sixth Corps. B.B. Henshey, the Hospital Steward, having been discharged on
                    account of disability, on the 1st of the same month, Lewis Keyser was appointed
                    to fill his place. Nugent, resting from the amputations and dressings of
                    Fredericksburg, and the Assistant Surgeon, Swift, dealt out, at the hour of the
                    Surgeon's call, the daily portions of quinine and calomel; while Nill, the
                    Quartermaster, and his aids, Allison and Kinsler, (what time the 
                    reveille had summoned the men from their downless couches to the labors of the
                    day,) devoted themselves assiduously to the diurnal duty of issuing hard-tack
                    and pork. The Sergeant Major, Ziegler, was busy in the Adjutant's quarters with
                    the morning reports, or flitting about the camp with unwelcome details for
                    picket or guard. Miller and Donovan, and their comrade musicians, were ever and
                    anon, throughout the day, sounding their too-accustomed calls; and Tommy Daily
                    and Kauffman, the color-sergeants, at the hour of dress-parade, brought out the
                    colors which they carried so gallantly up the heights of Fredericksburg, and
                    which they were destined to wave so lightly in the face of the enemy in the dark
                    woods about Chancellorsville.</p>
<p>In the Companies: In February, Captain William H. Davison was appointed Assistant
                    Inspector General on the Staff of General Tyler, and detached thenceforth until
                    the muster out of the regiment. The command of the company devolved on
                    Lieutenant James Pott; the First Lieutenant, Henry M. Hoke, having been made
                    Division Ordnance Officer in October, 1862, and detached on the staff of General
                    Humphreys. On the promotion of Brownson, James P. M'Cullough was advanced to
                    Captain from First Lieutenant, to which he had been promoted on the discharge of
                    Hornbaker. The First-Lieutenancy remained vacant. Lieutenant Trout, in command
                    of a detachment of thirty men, was on duty at the General Hospital, Stoneman's
                    Switch, from the 16th of January till the 16th of March. John H. Reed resigned
                    the captaincy of company D in January, and Josiah C. Hollinger was its commander
                    subsequently, with Platt as First Lieutenant and McCauley as Second. All the
                    officers of company H were absent on account of wounds for two months succeeding
                    the battle of Fredericksburg, and in the interval of their absence, Lieutenant
                    Walker, of E, first, and afterwards Lieutenant McWilliams, of F, was assigned to
                    the command of that company. Benjamin F.  Zook was made Second
                    Lieutenant of company G in the place of Harry Fortescue, mourned by his company.
                    Lieutenant Rowe commanded A.R. Davison's company while the latter had charge of
                    the regiment, and John W.P. Reid was for a while Ambulance Officer. Company A
                    was kept small by details from it, and Doebler was much missed by his men, but
                    his absence was not regretted more by them than by Welsh and McLenegan, his
                    Lieutenants. Captain William W. Walker, enjoying a better fortune than most
                    others, obtained from General Hooker a leave of absence for twenty days for the
                    benefit of his health, and hied him off to Waynesboro', leaving George Walker
                    and Brenneman to look after company E. This was before the epoch of "leaves" and
                    furloughs. George L. Miles and McCurdy were accustomed, in these peaceful times,
                    to take a quiet delight in exercising their men in the manual of arms; and while
                    Martin of I watched with fatherly care over his men, and Davis amused himself
                    with the drill, the honest Lieutenant Degan enjoyed himself often on extra and
                    special duty.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Bonsall, of Captain Wharton's company, was in arrest from the time of
                    the battle of Fredericksburg until the 29th of January, on the following charge
                    and specification:</p>
<p>Charge: Failure to deliver orders entrusted to him by his commanding officer for
                    delivery.</p>
<p>Specification: In this, that he, the said Lieutenant James C. Bonsall, of company
                    F, One Hundred and Twenty-Sixth Pennsylvania Volunteers, whilst his company and
                    regiment were on picket duty to the front and left of Fredericksburg, having
                    been ordered by Lieutenant Colonel D. Watson Rowe, the officer commanding his
                    regiment, to communicate an order of Brigadier General Humphreys' to the
                    commanding officer of the Berdan Sharp-shooters, and to the commanding officer
                    of a company of the Ninety-First Pennsylvania Infantry, on the picket line held
                    by the said One Hundred and Twenty-Sixth regiment, in relation to the withdrawal
                    of the said sharp-shooters and the said company of the Ninety-First, did fail to
                    deliver said order to the commanding officer of the said company. This at or
                    about 6 o'clock A.M., of the 16th day of December, 1862. </p>
<p>This charge was tried by a court-martial, and Lieutenant Bonsall was not found
                    wholly blameless, but was restored to duty. His duties during the entire night
                    of the 15th were of an arduous and dangerous character, being constantly, sent
                    with orders along the picket line, withdrawing and replacing the men; yet he
                    performed them with fidelity and alacrity. The blame principally attached, in
                    the opinion of the Court-Martial, to the officer of Lentz's party to whom
                    Bonsall communicated the order, after asking for the officer commanding the
                    party, and being referred to him as such, and who failed to notify his captain
                    of its reception; and they found him guilty and inflicted upon him a sentence of
                    extraordinary severity. This, however, General Humphreys did not approve. In
                    consequence of the failure to receive Colonel Rowe's order, Lentz and his men
                    were in great danger, and some of them were captured, as before narrated.</p>
<p>Many other things occurred in this interval between the battles of Fredericksburg
                    and Chancellorsville, which it would be pleasant to relate, but the limits of a
                    brief Sketch forbid.</p>
<p>The Changes in the Rank and File of the Companies: Who, among the thousand men,
                    was killed; who was wounded; who nobly died; who meanly deserted; who was
                    discharged or taken prisoner; who was promoted and who reduced, will be found in
                    the following pages in a compact shape. In the List of Casualties are gathered
                    the heroes of the battles. But not all of them; for many brave men escaped
                    unharmed - too many to be mentioned by name. Many gallant deeds of officers and
                    men must remain unwritten, to be told and talked of by the cheerful fire of a
                    winter's night; and many interesting stories and laughable incidents and,
                    perhaps, some pitiful tales, like that of Susan S. Edrington, - the sweet young
                    lady of seventeen summers, who died on the picket line - must be reserved for
                    those private recitals.</p>
<p>In this Sketch a simple chain of occurrences has been  forged, each
                    link of which, like a morning drum-beat to a spectral army, will call up before
                    the minds of the participants in the scenes described, a thousand departed and
                    long-forgotten associations connected with bivouac and battle.</p>
<p>On Monday, the 27th of April, Lieutenant Colonel Rowe received orders to be ready
                    to move the regiment at 12 M., and at that hour the march was taken up for
                    Chancellorsville. The effective of the regiment was twenty-nine officers and
                    five hundred and seventy-seven men; but Captain W.W. Walker's company having
                    been detailed for guard duty, was temporarily detached from the regiment,
                    decreasing its strength by three officers and fifty-six men. Proceeding up the
                    river on Monday and Tuesday, the Rappahannock was crossed on Wednesday, at
                    Kelly's Ford, by means of pontoons. Crossing Mountain creek the same evening and
                    halting long in the darkness of the night, on Thursday, the 30th, the Rapidan
                    was passed at Ely's Ford. It was an inspiring sight - the crossing of the
                    Rapidan. The long column moving down into the swift river, stretching across and
                    far up the long and gentle ascent on the southern side; the men wading arm-pit
                    deep, clothes and cartridge boxes swinging on the bayonets of the guns held well
                    up in the air. Having encamped over night in a wood of thick-standing pines, on
                    the 1st of May, (Friday,) the direct road to Chancellorsville was taken, and
                    shortly before noon the regiment, with the brigade, was massed by the side of
                    the Chancellor House, a solitary large brick dwelling, on an open clearing of
                    some three hundred yards in extent each way, in the margin of the Wilderness,
                    which constitutes Chancellorsville. Precisely at 12 M., the first gun of the
                    great fight opened. Three roads run east from Chancellorsville towards
                    Fredericksburg: on the right, the plank road; to its left, the turnpike, uniting
                    with the former at Tabernacle Church; still to the left, and not far from the
                         river, a road leading to Bank's Ford. Slocum's corps took the
                    plank road, Sykes' division the turnpike, and Meade, with Griffin's and
                    Humphreys' divisions, advanced on the river road for five miles and came within
                    sight of Bank's Ford. Thus this ford was uncovered and a position obtained out
                    of the Wilderness on a commanding ridge. As suddenly as unaccountably the three
                    columns were ordered back. Tyler's brigade hastened back at the double-quick the
                    whole distance to Chancellorsville, and came in just as Sykes was arriving,
                    skirmishing hotly with the enemy who had followed him closely. Tyler was just
                    able to get in without becoming engaged. On Friday evening, the One Hundred and
                    Twenty-Sixth, with the brigade, lay quite near the Chancellor House, being on
                    the left of the line of battle, which stretched along the Orange plank road,
                    westward about four miles. On Saturday, Humphreys was moved back near to the
                    Rappahannock, to the vicinity of Scott's Dam, and held a formidable position
                    there on high and steep bluffs, which he lined with artillery. Here the One
                    Hundred and Twenty-Sixth lay during Saturday and Saturday night, whilst Jackson
                    made his famous onslaught on the Eleventh and Twelfth Corps. The enemy
                    occasionally showed himself on this part of the line, but made no attack or
                    advance. Early on Sunday morning, however, Tyler's brigade was moved down from
                    the heights which it held, and hurried to the right. Along the road lay the
                    Eleventh Corps greatly shattered, ready to occupy the position evacuated.</p>
<p>About eight o'clock Tyler reached the open ground and the road running from
                    Chancellorsville to Ely's Ford, and prepared at once for action. In the hasty
                    march to the right, about thirty men of the regiment had seized the opportunity
                    to drop out among the men of the Eleventh Corps, and the Lieutenant Colonel
                    commanding having ordered the rolls to be called, four hundred and ninety men
                    only  responded to their names; but they were to be relied upon, and
                    the regiment was still comparatively large. Shortly the order came to move into
                    position in the line of battle, and Lieutenant Colonel Webb, of General Meade's
                    staff - across the open space swept by the batteries, down into the dense woods
                    a good distance - led the brigade and placed it on the right of General French,
                    whom it was to support, and under his orders. Captain W.W. Walker's company
                    having been detached as before-mentioned, did not participate in the action, but
                    a few of its men went in with Wm. H. Davison's company.</p>
<p>The brigade was just getting into position on the right of French, (in the order
                    from right to left of Ninety-First, One Hundred and Thirty-Fourth, One Hundred
                    and Twenty-Sixth, and One Hundred and Twenty-Ninth,) when a scout brought word
                    to Colonel Rowe, which was at once communicated to General Tyler, that the enemy
                    was hurrying masses to the right and would advance to the attack at once. At the
                    same moment, almost, the brigade opened fire on the right, and in a few minutes
                    the entire line was engaged. During the whole of this action the right of
                    Tyler's brigade was "in the air." No troops whatever were in position on its
                    right flank, and there was nothing to protect that flank or prevent its being
                    turned. The First Corps was not yet in place so as to join it. French,
                    therefore, was on the left; nothing was on the right of this brigade. Stuart,
                    now in command - in place of Jackson, shot the night before - was pushing his
                    forces to Tyler's unprotected right, and beyond it.</p>
<p>From the first the firing of the brigade was very rapid. The enemy, in the dense
                    woods and thicket, were not very clearly seen by the One Hundred and
                    Twenty-Sixth, nor did they for some time reply actively at this part of the
                    line. Colonel Rowe, therefore, sent first the Sergeant Major, Ziegler, then
                    Major Brownson, and at last went himself to  General Tyler to inform
                    him that the fire did not seem to be effective, and that the enemy appeared to
                    await the time when the ammunition should be exhausted, for their charge -
                    stating that it was already very low and requesting that the firing should cease
                    or at least slacken. But General Tyler, having the whole line and all its
                    exigencies in view, ordered the firing to be kept up, saying "Your men are doing
                    excellently, Colonel." At length, after more than an hour's hard work, the
                    ammunition was spent, and the men were beginning to rifle the cartridge-boxes of
                    the dead and wounded to supply themselves. The enemy now evidently began to
                    press forward more earnestly; their banners advanced through the woods; their
                    fire began to tell fearfully on the ranks of the regiment. The gaps, however,
                    were speedily closed, and the line was firm. The company officers were very
                    diligent and active. Major Brownson, in the Lieutenant Colonel's place on the
                    right, and Captain A.R. Davison, acting Major, on the left, increased their
                    exertions. Adjutant Stewart (now Division Commissary of Musters and detached,
                    but participating in the action with the regiment), and Acting Adjutant George
                    F. Platt, aided Brownson and Davison, respectively, with coolness and effect.
                    Colonel Rowe was everywhere along the line with words of encouragement. But
                    every moment it became more evident that unless ammunition arrived soon, the
                    line could not long be held. Colonel Rowe was cut in the cheek with a rifleball.
                    Major Brownson's clothes were pierced with bullets. Lieutenant J. Gilmore Rowe,
                    commanding company K, was borne from the field badly wounded in the head.
                    Captain Walker of H was struck. Men were falling all along the line. On the
                    right, company C had lost full one-fourth of the men McCullough took in. Company
                    I, on the left, had suffered nearly as much, and company H even more severely.
                    General Tyler now sent word that ammunition was not to be had after repeated
                    endeavors; that General French's orders were  to retire in as good
                    order as possible when the ammunition should be entirely exhausted. Still the
                    enemy pressed harder and harder in front.</p>
<p>Such was the state of affairs in the One Hundred and Twenty-Sixth, when Stuart,
                    having turned the right of the brigade and taken it in reverse, was pouring down
                    his troops on the right and rear, filling all the woods. The Ninety-First
                    regiment was first struck, and to avoid capture fell back. Then in turn the One
                    Hundred and Thirty-Fourth, next in line to the right, gave way. This left the
                    right flank of the One Hundred and Twenty-Sixth exposed. To change front in that
                    dense thicket was impossible, even if the impetuous charge which the regiment
                    was now sustaining in front would have permitted. The line was held, however,
                    till the last minute - till the rebels on the flank were within forty yards;
                    then, from right to left, the line melted away in the thick woods, and emerging
                    upon the cleared space beyond, re-formed behind the battery. Lieutenants
                    Fletcher and McCauley, and Sergeant Lesher, with a number of men, became mixed
                    with the enemy and were captured. The rebels pressed closely after to the edge
                    of the clearing and showed themselves on the open ground, but the guns opened
                    upon them with grape and canister, they speedily disappeared in the shadow of
                    the forest.</p>
<p>The same fate with the other regiments befell the One Hundred and Twenty-Ninth,
                    which stood on the left of the line next to French's men. In its turn it was
                    swept back, but so mingled did its men become with the enemy that there was a
                    hand to hand tussle for the colors, which, however, were safely borne off at
                    last. Having re-formed behind the battery, which stood near the small white
                    house along the road to Ely's Ford, the regiment remained there in support of
                    it, until the First Corps got well into their position on the right of the line,
                    when it was withdrawn with the rest of the brigade back from the road, a short
                        dis-tance into the woods, where it remained until the return
                    movement began.</p>
<p>The night of May the 5th, (Tuesday,) was a hard and gloomy one. It rained
                    violently. The commissary stores were burnt. The army was falling back across
                    the river. Again all sacrifices had been in vain. the men lay or sat about all
                    night long awaiting momentarily the order to move to the rear. It came at
                    daylight. In the forenoon of the 6th, the swollen stream was crossed on pontoons
                    at United States Ford, and after a fatiguing march of twelve miles, through deep
                    mud, the site of the old camp, whence the regiment started on the
                    Chancellorsville campaign, was reached, and it was done with marching and
                    fighting.</p>
<p>A quiet week in camp succeeded the battle of Chancellorsville. The term of
                    service of the regiment was about to expire. General Tyler assembled it, and
                    publicly extolled the conduct of the men in both the great actions in which they
                    participated. Tuesday, the 12th of May, was a day of leave-taking in camp. There
                    was a great visiting among the regiments, and the General's quarters were
                    crowded all day. At six o'clock in the morning of Wednesday, May 13, 1863, the
                    regiment took cars to Stoneman's Station for Aquia Landing, and ceased to belong
                    to the Army of the Potomac. At Aquia, the boat Warner lay ready to convey the
                    men to Washington, where, after a beautiful ride up the Potomac, they arrived,
                    and went to the Soldiers' Retreat, blessing, all the way, James Watt and those
                    who helped him, bring about, for purposes of locomotion, the substitution of
                    steam and iron for human will and muscle. The next forenoon the cars carried
                    them to Baltimore. At dark they continued their homeward journey to Harrisburg.
                    At 7 o'clock in the morning of Friday, the 15th, the regiment marched, with
                    drums beating and flags flying, through Harrisburg to Camp Curtin. The comrades,
                    free from restraint, gay and happy, enjoyed themselves about the town or in the
                    camp,  for several days, while the officers were busy with the
                    preparation of the muster-out rolls. At length, on Wednesday, the 20th of May,
                    the companies were mustered out of service, the men received their pay and
                    discharges, and, with cordial hand-shakings, separated and started home. The
                    companies from Juniata were welcomed at Mifflntown, and those from Franklin county received a great ovation at
                    Chambersburg. Each town and township beside gave a separate reception to its own
                    peculiar company.</p>
