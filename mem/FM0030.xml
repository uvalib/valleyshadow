                    near here, while asleep last night.</p>
                <p>The veteran of the gray legions, whose pride was that he had never surrendered at

                    several important conflicts of the Civil War, his share in the defense of
                    Lynchburg <abbr expan="Virginia">Va.</abbr>, and his command of the raid which
                    culminated n the burning of Chambersburg, <abbr expan="Pennsylvania">Pa.</abbr>,
                    probably are the most widely known of the activities of the man who was called
                    from a professorship in the University of Virginia to command troops of the
                    State to which he gave allegiance.</p>
                <p>General McCausland was a conspicuous <orig reg="figure">figule</orig> in the raid
                    through Maryland in July, 1864. He levied tribute of $25,000 from, Hagerstown,
                    won a cavalry fight at Frederick City and made the first attack at the ford of
                    the Monocacy, across which he drove the Federal forces. Joining in the
                    demonstration against Washington, D. C., the daring commander actually
                    penetrated into the town of Georgetown, but was compelled to retire before
                    Federal reinforcements.</p>
                <p>Virtual Exile For Years</p>
                <p>In his later years General McCausland insisted that his military service was not
                    given to the Confederate Army but to the Army of Virginia. After the war so
                    bitter was the feeling over the burning of Chambersburg that McCausland left the
                    country a virtual exile and for several years wandered about Europe and Mexico
                    before returning to settle on the rich river bottom lands which he developed
                    into some of the finest farms in this region.</p>
                <p>He was born in St. Louis in September, 1836, the son of a native of County
                    Tyrone, Ireland.</p>
