                <p>John Bennett remembers Jack Trimble, a descendant of the Augusta Trimbles and a
                    cousin of John Marshall McCue, who served as a courier for John Imboden during
                    the Civil War.</p>

            <div1 type="article" id="d5">
                <p>In the Charleston News and Courier of September, 1868, this paragraph appeared:
                    "The death of Little Jack Trimbnle, the 'boy soldier.' On the 8th of August,
                    1868, John A. Trimble died of consumption, aged about twenty-four years, at the
                    home of his father, in HIllsboro, Ohio."</p>
                <p>Many a soldier who served in the Valley of Virginia during the eventful campaigns
                    of 1862, 1863, and 1864 read with grief this announcement. Everybody in the
                    valley knew Little Jack Trimble, and everybody loved him. Being extremely
                    delicate from early childhood, he had the appearance of a fragile boy <pb
                        n="474"/> of twelve or fourteen years. He was descended from the Trimbles of
                    Augusta County, <abbr expan="Virginia">Va.</abbr>, some of whom emigrated to
                    Ohio when it was a territory and a wilderness, and, growing up with the State,
                    filled the high offices of Governor, United States Senator, Representative in
                    Congress, general in the army, and other conspicuous positions.</p>
                <p>He had numerous relatives in Augusta, and had spent several years before the war
                    with his cousin, <abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> J. Marshall McCue, of that
                    county. Like most invalid youths, he possessed a mind of extraordinary quickness
                    and strength, which he improved so as to be a most interesting and entertaining
                    companion for men of the highest intelligence. He was an enthusiastic
                    Confederate; and, delicate and feeble lad though he was, he resolved in 1862 to
                    enter the army. He volunteered his services to Colonel (afterwards General)
                    Imboden, who was then engaged beyond our lines in organizing the hardy
                    mountaineers of the border and northwest counties for service in the Confederate
                    army. He was accepted as a courier and a scout, and right nobly did he perform
                    his duties; for, being an admirable rider and well mounted, he moved over great
                    distances with wonderful celerity.</p>
                <p>Collected, shrewd, observing, intelligent, and brave, he was often <orig
                        reg="entrusted">intrusted</orig> with important information to be conveyed
                    when writing would have been unsafe and through a region of country where a man
                    could not have passed, but where a boy attracted little attention. He made many
                    narrow escapes. Sometimes he outwitted those who sought to find out who and what
                    he was, and only once was he actually captured. This was in the mountains of
                    Hardy, where the enemy held Moorfield. Jack was taken to headquarters and
                    closely questioned; but he appeared to be only an ordinary mountain lad of no
                    consequence, and was ordered by the general commanding to be put upstairs to
                    sleep. After all was silent, Jack disappeared, found his horse, flanked the
                    pickets, and at daybreak was many amile across the Virginia mountains on his way
                    to his own people. He was trusted, respected, and honored by his officers, and
                    was a universal <orig reg="favorite">favorate</orig> and pet with the men.</p>
                <p>I shall be greatly pleased to hear from any comrade who remembers John Alexander
                    Trimble, the well-loved "Little Jack," whose services are thus briefly
                    generalized. I feel sure that there is left some relative, friend, or comrade in
                    Imboden's command who remembers the boy courier and can give some particulars of
                    his service. James Blythe Anderson, 657 Elsmere Park, Lexington, <abbr
                        expan="Kentucky">Ky.</abbr>, is writing the genealogy of the Anderson family
                    for publication, and he is as anxious as I am for facts in regard to "Little
                    Jack," as he wishes to give his service faithful record in his book.</p>
