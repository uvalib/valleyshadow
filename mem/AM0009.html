<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> This chapter discusses in some detail the military history of the Confederacy
                    prior to the 1863 raid on present-day West Virginia led by Gen. Imboden. It then
                    describes the raid itself and its effects, the most notable of which was a great
                    push to form the state of West Virginia.</p>

<p>What is known in war parlance as the "Imboden Raid" occured in the spring of 1863, beginning the latter part of April and
                    winding up before the month of May had expired.</p>
<p>This was in some respects the most important military expedition that was planned
                    and executed by the Confederate authorities within the scope of the Virginia
                    campaign; still little is known by the Virginia people of the "Imboden Raid."</p>
<p>The Confederate soldiers who were on this expedition were almost entirely Western
                    Virginia men, and, when the authorities had determined on the raid, these men
                    were sought, far and near, because of their knowledge of the country, the people
                    and the army posts kept up by the Federals in Western Virginia. Another thing:
                    Many of these men had been absent from their homes and friends two long years,
                    and the authorities knew their great anxiety to return to their homes, for which
                    they still cherished the dearest memories.</p>
<p>The Twenty-fifth and Thirty-first Regiments of Virginia Infantry were withdrawn
                    from General Lee's army a few days before the battle of Chancellorsville and
                    allowed to accompany this expedition. These two regiments belonged to General
                    Early's old brigade, and this was the first time they had been separated from
                    General Jackson since they had been made a part of his division.</p>
<p>The man who planned and did more to execute the "Imboden Raid" than any other one
                    person was William L. Jackson, who became a brigadier of the Confederate Army
                    before the close of the Civil War. After the "Phillipi Retreat" William L.
                    Jackson was made colonel of the Thirty-first Virginia  Regiment, an
                    office that he held up to the reorganization of the army in the spring of 1862,
                    at which time he became a member of Stonewall Jackson's staff, a position that
                    he retained up to the spring of 1863. William L. Jackson was born and reared in
                    Lewis county, Va., (now West Virginia), and was a
                    first cousin of Thomas Jonathan Jackson, better known as "Stonewall." He was a
                    lawyer by profession, and in the year 1859 was elected circuit judge of the
                    Twenty-first Judicial District of Virginia, that was composed of the counties
                    of. Taylor, Preston, Upshur, Harrison, Barbour, Tucker, Randolph and Marion, and
                    was known at the beginning of the war of 1861 as Judge Jackson, and at this time
                    was the most widely known, as well as the most popular man in all that part of
                    Virginia.</p>
<p>Before beginning the story of the "Imboden Raid," in order to have a proper
                    understanding of the whole affair, it is necessary to give an epitomized history
                    of military events that had preceded the year of 1863. A great part of the hard
                    fighting of the Civil War was done in the campaign of 1862, and although the way
                    matters looked at the beginning of that year, as being very unfavorable to the
                    Confederates, yet before the close of that year some of the most brilliant
                    victories of the war had been gained by the Confederates.</p>
<p>WHAT HAD BEEN DONE.</p>
<p>In the year 1862 a dry summer and fall had prevailed and dry weather is an
                    indispensable requisite for active military operations. To recount, before the
                    close of that year, Stonewall Jackson had made his splendid Valley Campaign
                    including the battle of McDowell, the Seven Days' battles around Richmond had
                    been fought and won; not long thereafter the battle of Cedar Run, and very soon
                    thereafter the battles of Thoroughfare Gap and the Second Manassas where and
                    when General John Pope hurriedly left his headquarters, that had been in the
                    saddle. Later, north of the Potomac; the battle of Sharpsburg was fought when
                    General McClellan went down in defeat the last time. This was more than the
                    "flesh and blood" of which Mr. Lincoln and his Cabinet were made, could stand;
                         and poor McClellan, although a man of fine war talent, and
                    having exerted that talent with every power of his nature in behalf of his
                    government, was bound to go, and not long thereafter was relieved of his command
                    and retired in disgrace to private life. Just one year before the Northern
                    people, with tongue and pen, had compared him to the great Napoleon. Then it was
                    Ambrose Burnside was put in command of the Army of the Potomac.</p>
<p>A man whose zeal and ambition were consuming him, and in his rash efforts to do
                    what neither of his predecessors had been able to do, General Halleck, his chief
                    at Washington, telegraphs him on the 10th day of December, 1862 (see War of
                    Rebellion, Series I., Vol. LI., Part I, supplement
                    page 955), "I beg of you not to telegraph details of your plans, nor the times
                    of your intended movements. No secret can be kept which passes through so many
                    hands." Nevertheless, three days after the date of this dispatch, General
                    Burnside did fight the great battle of Fredericksburg, where he was
                    overwhelmingly defeated. The United States Congress that was in session when
                    this battle was fought, held a long investigation to find out the causes of
                    General Burnside's failure, and the readers of this paper, who desire to know
                    the causes that conspired to defeat General Ambrose Burnside at Fredericksburg
                    on the 13th day of December, 1862, should get the Congressional Record of that
                    year, suffice it to say here, that the special committee to whom the case had
                    been referred did find a scapegoat on the 6th day of April, 1863, in the person
                    of Major-General William B. Franklin, who bore away, to the wilderness the sin
                    of the defeat, (see same Vol., page 1019).</p>
<p>Then "all was quiet along the Potomac"-in fact, the signal defeat of General
                    Burnside greatly enhanced the significance of the oft-repeated war-song, "All is
                    Quiet Along the Potomac," and such was the status of events with General Lee's
                    army until April, 1863.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1862 the Confederates abandoned all Virginia territory west of
                    the Alleghanies, which was immediately occupied by the advancing Federals, and
                    the war records of the early part of that year bristle with the dispatches of
                        Gen-erals Robert Houston Milroy, George Crook and Colonel
                    Rutherford B. Hayes, telling of their wonderful adventures, all of which were
                    successful from their standpoint. General Milroy advanced over the Staunton and
                    Parkersburg Turnpike and succeeded in penetrating the State as far east as
                    McDowell, in Highland county. General Crook got as far east as Lewisburg, in
                    Greenbrier county, and Colonel Hayes reached Pearisburg, in Giles county.
                    Colonel Hayes was in command of the famous Twenty-third Ohio Regiment, and the
                    dozen or more dispatches sent back by him on that expedition are to this day a
                    remarkable revelation, and the greatest mystery is, that Rutherford B. Hayes, as
                    President of the United States, should put his name, on the 16th day of June,
                    1880, to an act of Congress, making appropriations for the publication of what
                    is so prejudicial to his own character as an honest and upright man. There were
                    no rebels in sight on this expedition, and the colonel was happy.</p>
<p>The only thing that troubled him was the "Captured Stuff," as he styles it, this
                    he continually refers to in his dispatches as the only trouble. There was no
                    trouble to whip the enemy, but the "Captured Stuff," he really did not have a
                    sufficient number of men to care for. From the dispatches, this "Captured Stuff"
                    consisted of horses, mules, oxen and milk cows, and what little hay and grain
                    the already impoverished farmers had on hand in the spring of the year of 1862.
                    As late as the 8th day of May, 1862, from Pearisburg he sends a dispatch (see
                    same Vol. 609) to Colonel E. P. Scammon, commanding
                    brigade in which he says, "This is a lovely spot, a fine, clean village, most
                    beautiful and romantic surrounding country, polite and educated 'secesh' people.
                    It is the spot to organize our brigade." The writer would love to give this
                    whole dispatch to his readers. It is a gushing affair. The Colonel was evidently
                    under the influence of balmy spring when he wrote this dispatch, but it is too
                    long to be inserted here.</p>
<p>PROSPERITY SHORT LIVED.</p>
<p>Colonel Hayes' prosperity, however, was short lived, as the very next day he
                    informs his brigade commander by dispatch of the 9th (see same volume, page 611)
                    of May, "Sir, you will  have to hurry forward reinforcements
                    rapidly - as rapidly as possible to prevent trouble here," and with a postscript
                    adds "A party on the other side of the river is firing on our men, collecting
                    forage and provisions."</p>
<p>This is the very last of Colonel Hayes' dispatches on that expedition, and the
                    light of his pen flickers and goes out, and no doubt the Colonel and his men for
                    the next few days were engaged in business that forbade much writing. What
                    happened to General Milroy at the village of McDowell on the 8th day of May, of
                    the same year, has long been a matter of public history-an event the old,
                    grizzled Confederate soldiers yet love to commemorate. The jolt Stonewall
                    Jackson gave him on that memorable day so completely knocked the wind out of him
                    that he never had any luck afterwards as a military man. From this man's own
                    pen, his character, too, is a remarkable revelation. Somebody in the village of
                    McDowell, where he had his headquarters, a few days before the battle, had cut
                    his saddle to pieces, and he, thereupon, had arrested some twenty or more of the
                    most prominent old men of the country and brought to his headquarters upon the
                    charge of being rebel sympathizers, but the real offense was the mutilation of
                    his saddle, and at the trial the fact was developed that he believed Jefferson
                    Davis had connived at the destruction of his saddle.</p>
<p>General Milroy was a foreigner by birth, and when relieved of his command, and
                    under military arrest for allowing his whole brigade being gobbled up, he wrote
                    Mr. Lincoln on the 13th of September, 1863 (see same Vol., page 1087), a long and most pitiful letter, in which he says: "If
                    this cannot be granted, I would for many reasons desire a command in Texas. I
                    have traveled through and resided there for a time, and became a naturalized
                    citizen there before the annexation. I would be greatly pleased to help avenge
                    the terrible wrongs of the Union citizens on the monsters there, and desire to
                    be down there when the rebellion ends, to be ready to pitch into the French in
                    Mexico;" and from this letter we see, altho' his
                    wind and luck were gone, his zeal for war was still consuming him. Gen. Geo. Crook met with better fortune at Lewisburg,
                    when on the 23d day of May, 1862, he partially defeated the Confederate General
                    Heth, but that country became too hot for him,  and he, too,
                    retreated towards the Ohio River, and finally wound up his West Virginia
                    campaign the winter of 1864-'5 at Cumberland City,
                    Maryland, by accepting unconditionally and jointly with General Benjamin
                    Franklin Kelly an invitation on the part of Jessie McNeil to accompany him to
                    Richmond, Virginia.</p>
<p>What Confederate soldier is now living who was permitted to see the sight of two
                    major-generals of the Federal army dressed out in full uniform, covered with
                    medals of honor, mounted on two old poor, lanky Confederate mules, each
                    caparisoned with a blind-bridle and the little duck-tailed Confederate saddle,
                    coming into camp? Such was the appearance of Generals Crook and Kelly when they
                    appeared in the Confederate camp, and from their own account, the half-clad,
                    starving Confederate soldiers treated them with the utmost respect, and divided
                    their scant rations with their two distinguished prisoners. Such is the fate of
                    war. "This is the state of man: Today he puts forth the tender leaves of hopes;
                    to-morrow blossoms and bears his blushing honors thick upon him; the third day
                    comes a frost, a killing frost, and when he thinks, good easy man, full surely
                    his greatness is a-ripening, nips his root, and then he falls." By the first day
                    of June, 1863, the Federals had abandoned all the territory of Western Virginia
                    that they had acquired by their forward movement in the early spring, and even
                    contracted their lines further back towards the Ohio River than they were at the
                    close of the year of 1861, and by the 1st of September, 1862, General Loring
                    occupied the Kanawha Valley, and General Jenkins passed through Western Virginia
                    into the State of Ohio, and when winter closed in on the mountains of Virginia
                    that year the outermost posts of the Federals were in Beverley, in Randolph
                    county; Bulltown, in Braxton county; Summerville, in Nicholas county, and
                    Fayetteville, in Fayette county; all of these places were fortified with ditches
                    and parapets, and were well supplied with artillery, and the troops lived in
                    block houses with portholes The Confederates occupied the entire Greenbrier
                    Valley and the counties of Highland, Pendleton and Hardy, and scouted well down
                    towards the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.</p>
<p>The writer spent the winter of 1862-'63 in Pocahontas
                    county,  and as he now remembers it, the coldest winter and the
                    deepest snow that he ever saw in the mountains of Virginia. At the beginning of
                    this winter a Colonel Winston Fontaine, who was born and reared near Richmond,
                    came to Pocahontas county, commissioned by the Confederate government to raise a
                    regiment of mounted men. This gentleman was a grandson of Patrick Henry, and
                    married Miss Mary Burrows, the daughter of Dr. Burrows, the famous Baptist
                    preacher of Richmond, who made such a reputation as chaplain among the
                    Confederate soldiers. A Major Morgan accompanied Colonel Fontaine as his
                    adjutant. Mrs. Fontaine also accompanied her husband to Western Virginia and
                    spent the entire winter in the home of the late Colonel Paul McNeil, of the
                    Little Levels of Pocahontas county. This gentleman had represented Pocahontas
                    county in the Constitutional Convention of 1861, and the writer is his youngest
                    son. At this time I was not an enlisted soldier, but was necessarily thrown a
                    great deal of the time with Colonel Fontaine. I was seventeen years old, and
                    Colonel Fontaine was just the man a boy would admire. He was a brave, generous
                    Christian gentleman, a fine shot and a classic scholar. My father required me to
                    help feed and care for his live stock that winter. Colonel Fontaine succeeded
                    beyond his expectations in recruiting his regiment, and before the opening of
                    spring he had a very respectable nucleus of a regiment of mounted men.</p>
<p>SPATS IN COLD WEATHER.</p>
<p>As the long, cold winter wore away, despite the snow and cold there were
                    occasional spats between the outposts, in which the Confederates fully held
                    their own, and notably on one occasion, when a large raiding party came from
                    Beverley to capture General Fontaine's force, the result of which was to leave
                    fully one-third of their number.</p>
<p>One dark, rainy night, at my father's, about the 1st of April, 1863, from the
                    noise we were apprised that some mounted men were approaching the house. On
                    listening I heard the click of a saber. The first thought was that it was the
                    Yankee cavalry, We fixed to defend ourselves as quickly as possible, but instead
                    of shooting the strangers began to halloo, and then we knew  that
                    they were not Yankees, and when they dismounted and came into the house it
                    proved to be Colonel William L. Jackson, Major William P. Thompson and their
                    colored servant man. This was a great surprise to us, as these gentlemen had
                    been connected with the Eastern army for more than a year, and we then thought
                    of them as a part of General Lee's army, and coming this way in the dead hours
                    of the night was very significant. It was my first meeting with Colonel William
                    L. Jackson, and I will now try to describe him as he appeared to me then-a
                    seven-teen-year-old boy - and to this day I still retain a perfect mental
                    photograph of his appearance. I was introduced to Colonel Jackson in my father's
                    family room. He had on a beautiful uniform of new Confederate gray cloth, with
                    three stars on the collar, that told he held the rank of colonel. General
                    Jackson would have weighed fully two hundred pounds and was at least six feet in
                    height. He had unusually fine shoulders, head and face, and the most animated
                    man that I had ever seen in conversation.</p>
<p>His hair and whiskers were the deepest red that I had ever seen on the head and
                    face of any man. In reply to a question from my father, he stated that he was
                    forty-two years old. I gathered from the conversation that he had known my
                    father very well indeed before the war began. He seemed to be perfectly informed
                    of all matters, both civil and military, relating to the Confederacy. A good
                    dead of the time that night, during the conversation, he walked the floor,
                    although he had made a long horseback ride the day he reached my father's.
                    Colonel Jackson's mission to my father's house was to see Colonel Fontaine
                    brought to the parlor, where they were introduced to each other.</p>
<p>Colonel Jackson told Colonel Fontaine, in the presence of Major Thompson, my
                    father and myself, that he (Jackson) was just from Richmond, where he had seen
                    Mr. Davis and had come by General Lee's headquarters on the Rappahannock River,
                    and that General Lee's army was hard up for "meat rations," and the plan had
                    been made up to raid Northwest Virginia and capture and drive South every kind
                    of cattle in that part of the country that would make beef then and the next
                    summer. This, Colonel Jackson said had been determined  on by the
                    authorities as the only way to provide meat rations for the Confederate
                    soldiers. Colonel Jackson informed Colonel Fontaine that night that he (Jackson)
                    had been authorized by the authorities of Richmond to take part of the regiment
                    which Colonel Fontaine had already recruited, and in conjunction with some other
                    detached companies to form what was afterwards known as the Nineteenth Virginia
                    Cavalry Regiment. Colonel Jackson had letters from the department to Colonel
                    Fontaine, which he produced, and the latter turned over the troops to the
                    former. As a boy, my sympathies were at once aroused in behalf of Colonel
                    Fontaine, but it was explained to me, that the Confederate government had taken
                    this step because of Colonel Jackson's known popularity in the Northwest part of
                    Virginia, and if the contemplated raid succeeded, that Colonel Jackson would
                    recruit sufficiently to organize a brigade, which he did in the summer of 1863,
                    and commanded throughout the war, and he was familiarly known as "Mudwall
                    Jackson."</p>
<p>The writer desires just here to explain the acquisition of the character of
                    William L. Jackson, as a Confederate soldier; the fact is, he was as brave a man
                    as lived, and never refused to fight, when the attendant circumstances were
                    anything like equal; and now for the explanation of the title "Mudwall." In
                    August, 1863, General Jackson was confronted and pressed by the Federal force,
                    which was more than equal his own at Beverley, under the command of Colonel
                    Thom. Harris, of the Tenth West Virginia Infantry. At the same time, General
                    William Woods Averill assembled a large force of cavalry, fully 6,000 men at
                    Keyser, (which during the war was called New Creek Station), on the 'Baltimore
                    and Ohio Railroad, in the month of August, 1863. made a dash to capture Jackson
                    and his entire force; he went through Pendleton, Highland and Bath counties, and
                    only lacked five hours of getting in the rear of Jackson, ten miles west of the
                    Warm Springs, but Jackson went through without the loss of a man or a horse, and
                    while Averill went on and fought the battle of "Dry Creek" or "White Sulphur,"
                    where he was defeated on the 26th of August. The disappointed force that had
                    come from Beverley remained two or three days at Huntersville, the county seat
                    of Pocahontas,  waiting for General Averill to return, while 2,500
                    men were loitering there.</p>
<p>Some wag of a fellow wrote a doggerel verse on the inside walls of the old
                    Courthouse, entitled "Mudwall Jackson," the principal feature of which was a
                    complaint that "Mudwall Jackson" would not fight. The writer saw this writing a
                    few days after the retreat of the Federals, and it was understood by the
                    Confederate soldiers as having been put there by a Yankee soldier, and as we
                    Confederates understood it at the time, the animus of the verse was because the
                    then dead "Stonewall" had been so hard on the Yankee, and the live "Mudwall" had
                    escaped their net.</p>
<p>THREW THE SCOUTS OFF.</p>
<p>So much for the explanation of the title "Mudwall." When the Confederate troops
                    in the Greenbrier Valley were put in motion for the raid into Northwestern
                    Virginia, the marching orders were to go east, and the common opinion among the
                    soldiers was that they were to be sent to the Valley of Virginia. This false
                    movement on the part of the Confederates was made in order to throw the Federal
                    scouts off the track, which it did most completely. Beginning at Lewisburg, the
                    22nd Virginia Infantry Regiment, under the command of Colonel George Patton,
                    marched east to the White Sulphur, and there turned north and passed through the
                    Eastern part of Greenbrier and Pocahontas counties into Highland county. The
                    troops in Pocahontas county, consisting of the Nineteenth Virginia Cavalry and
                    Dunn's battalion of mounted infantry, were ordered towards the Warm Springs, and
                    after one day's march turned north. The soldiers of this command had no idea of
                    their destination when they received the marching orders. At this time the
                    writer, as been told, was not an enlisted soldier, but the fact that within the
                    last year the Federal raiding parties had seized and carried away more than two
                    hundred head of my father's cattle, and a number of fine horses, there would be
                    an opportunity now of recovering this stock; this fact more than anything else,
                    led me to accompany the expedition.</p>
<p>Another thing, my father the fall before had given me the most beautiful saddle
                    horse that I have ever owned in my life. The horse was five years old, a blood
                    bay, 15 1-2 hands tall,  with a star in his forehead, the swiftest
                    animal I have ever mounted, and despite his strength and speed, as docile as a
                    lamb. The horse had an exceedingly sore back, when he came into my possession,
                    and up to this time I knew nothing of the former history of the horse, and how
                    fond I was of riding him no pen now can tell. An older brother of mine, who held
                    a commission as captain under Colonel Jackson, and I, started alone on this
                    expedition. The evening of the first day we crossed the Alleghany Mountain into
                    Highland county, and just at the foot of the mountain we overtook the
                    Twenty-second regiment, resting in the roadside, and so soon as I began to ride
                    by the regiment, I heard one soldier call: "Colonel Barbee yonder is your
                    horse." Whereupon the whole regiment began to clamor, "Yonder is Billie," (the
                    name of the horse). Colonel Barbee, who was the lieutenant-colonel of the
                    regiment, rode to my side, and seeing that I was much perturbed, introduced
                    himself to me, and in a very pleasant way gave me a short history of the horse.</p>
<p>He had been bred in Kentucky, and the Colonel had ridden him a year, but, on
                    account of his weight, he had ruined his back and rendered the horse unfit for
                    service. Colonel Barbee had sold him to Captain Bob Moorman, of Greenbrier
                    county, and the latter had sold him to my father. In the meantime, the soldiers
                    had gathered around him until he was completely hemmed in on all sides, and
                    there I sat, a bashful seventeen-year-old boy, not enjoying in the least
                    notoriety that Billie had given me. The Twenty-second Regiment that day had
                    fully nine hundred men, and Virginia had no troops in the field that made a
                    better record than that splendid regiment of men, and the writer can still
                    recall distinctly the faces of many of those noble young men, as they looked to
                    him on that April evening, now more than forty-two years ago.</p>
<p>MET AT HIGHTOWN.</p>
<p>The morning of the second day after this occurrence the troops all met at
                    Hightown, a point on the old Staunton and Parkersburg Road six miles west of
                    Monterey, and from the turnpike road at Hightown, two large and beautiful
                    limestone springs can be seen one North, the other south of the road; one the
                         extreme head of the South Branch of the Potomac River, the
                    other the extreme head of Jackson's River, the longest branch of the James. At
                    this point is the junction of the public roads leading up and down the South
                    branch and the Jackson Rivers.</p>
<p>The morning was an ideal spring morning, and the writer had often thought the
                    most inspiring sight ever brought before him he saw there that moring. The soldiers were still bewildered as to their
                    movements, but when the command began to move west over the Staunton and
                    Parkersburg Turnpike you could see joy in their faces. First came General John
                    Imboden, at the head of his brigade, composed of the Sixty-second Virginia
                    Infantry, the Eighteenth Virginia Calvary, some independent companies and one
                    good battery of four pieces of artillery. The Sixty-second Regiment, a large
                    regiment then, was immediatly behind General
                    Imboden's staff, and with fife and drum they moved out. Next came Colonel
                    Patton, as true a knight as ever put lance to rest, at the head of the
                    Twenty-second Regiment. Next came Colonel William L. Jackson, whose face was
                    beaming with joy, at the head of the Ninteenth Regiment of Cavalry. Next Colonel
                    Dunn, at the head of his batalion; next Colonel
                    John Higginbothan, at the head of the Twenty-fifth Virginia Infantry-and what a
                    soldier this man was! Next came that war-worn veteran, Colonel John S. Huffman,
                    at the head of "the old Thirty-first," as the members of that regiment delighted
                    to call it. The scene was too much for my young rebel heart, and for the sake of
                    Billie, I am glad that no one saw me just then.</p>
<p>I was visibly affected. There were the first Confederate soldiers that I had seen
                    marching with colors flying and to the step of martial music, since General Lee
                    had fallen back from Valley Mountain in September, 1861. A great many men who
                    were refugees from Northwest Virginia had found out the secret of the raid and
                    accompanied the raiders. General Imboden, when he got into Randolph county, had
                    fully five thousand fighting men. I marched the first day with the Twenty-fifth
                    and Thirty-first Regiments, for the reason I wanted to see my cousins and
                    acquaintances that I had not now seen for two years. The ranks of these two
                    regiments had been fearfully depleted at that time; and what a change had come
                    over the living. Their faces had grown old and careworn and while they looked
                    strong  and healthy, still their limbs were so stiff that not one
                    of them I tried could mount "Billie" from the ground. I managed to get two of my
                    first cousins on the horse at different times from a high bank, but it affected
                    the hip and leg so they took cramp and had to get off immediately. No wonder!
                    These were the legs that made up Stonewall Jackson's foot cavalry, and when you
                    reflect what they had already done, how could they be anything else but stiff?
                    The first night we camped on the battlefield of "Camp Bartow," twenty miles west
                    of Hightown. Here it was Colonel Ed. Johnson defeated the Federals on the 3d day
                    of October, 1861.</p>
<p>The next morning it was raining, and began to snow as we began to ascend that
                    mighty barrier, Cheat Mountain. The snow fell fully six inches on the top of
                    Cheat Mountain that day, and many of the men who were scantly dressed suffered
                    fearfully from the cold. But we pushed on through the storm and reached
                    Huttonsville, a distance of twenty miles from where we had camped the night
                    before.</p>
<p>By this time it was fully known among the soldiers that General William E. Jones,
                    with his brigade of cavalry, was to operate in conjunction with us and was to
                    strike the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad near Martinsburg, and to go west,
                    doing all the damage he could to the railroad, and we were to meet him somewhere
                    near Clarksburg. The fact that General Jones was on this raid gave General
                    Imboden and his men greater courage and confidence in their own undertaking.
                    General Jones was known to be a dashing cavalry officer, and a splendid fighter,
                    and everybody felt that sure he would do his part. At Huttonsville we were
                    within eleven miles of Beverley, and we knew the Federals had a strong force at
                    this place, and that the town was strongly fortified and supplied with
                    artillery. We also knew that we were ahead of all news and that the enemy had no
                    idea of an approach. The night at Huttonsville was a fearful one on men exposed
                    as we were. It rained all night, and did not cease until late in the afternoon
                    on the next day.</p>
<p>WORK AHEAD OF THEM.</p>
<p>As soon after daylight as possible General Imboden had his  army in
                    motion and every man believed that there was work ahead of us that day.</p>
<p>The infantry could not cross the Tygart's Valley River, as the turnpike does, but
                    had to keep on the east side of the river all the way down to Beverley's. One
                    company of cavalry went in advance of the infantry. This was Captain McNeil's,
                    and was selected because they were the best mounted men. After going a short
                    distance, General Imboden told Captain McNeil to pick out five or six of the
                    swiftest horses and put them far enough in front to apprise him of any approach.
                    Billie was one of the horses chosen, and I rode him, Billie was in all his glory
                    that day. The first party we struck was a foraging party, after corn and hay,
                    with thirty-two good mules in the wagons. We rode right into them before they
                    knew of our presence, and the guard of a dozen or so mounted men surrendered
                    without a shot. Not a man or mule escaped. A little farther on our party of five
                    met a quartermaster, with the rank of major. He was a big, fat Dutchman, and was
                    mounted on one of the most beautiful sorrel mares I ever saw. The major thought
                    that we were his men, coming back empty, and began to abuse us. We told him to
                    see the fellows behind, and he passed on without stopping, and I don't think
                    looked at us.</p>
<p>This is the last, and first, time that I ever saw that major, but, as I saw one
                    of General Imboden's aids riding the major's mare the next day, I knew what had
                    become of the major. Thus far not a shot had been fired, and our orders were not
                    to shoot. Within a few minutes of passing the major we met quite a squad of
                    cavalry, and as soon as they saw us they turned and ran, and we gave chase for
                    mile or two, but did not overtake them. At the close of this race we had our
                    first skirmish, which might have proved a serious affair had not a courier
                    reached us just then with orders to press them, for the reason that, when the
                    final dash was to be made for the breastworks, General Imboden wanted the
                    infantry as close as possible. There were fully fifteen hundred Federal soldiers
                    in the earthworks around Beverley, and if they had been determined men could
                    have stood off a force three times their number. At first they put up a show of
                    a strong fight, but became demoralized and abandoned their positions, and fled
                    towards Philippi. The  Philippi road was the nearest way to the
                    Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and this road had been used by the Federals at
                    Beverley for the purpose of hauling supplies. Another thing in our efforts to
                    capture the fort at Beverley. We had taken the Staunton and Parkersburg pike
                    beyond Beverley that leads to Buchanan. The Federals left Beverley just before
                    sundown, and as we afterwards learned, fled all the way through the mud to
                    Philippi (a distance of thirty-one miles) that night.</p>
<p>NEITHER KILLED NOR WOUNDED.</p>
<p>There was not a single Confederate killed or seriously wounded in the capture of
                    Beverley, in April, 1863. The Confederates were pretty well worn out when we
                    reached Beverley, and especially was this true of the infantry, that had come
                    from Lewisburg, Staunton and Harrisonburg, all of them having tramped over one
                    hundred miles, but they were greatly rejoiced at the thought of capturing so
                    easily the old town of Beverley, that had then been in the hands of the Federals
                    since the 11th day of July, 1861.</p>
<p>It was the capture of this town on that day that made the great military
                    reputation of General George B. McClellan, and the earthworks that we had just
                    chased the Yankees out of were probably the product of his brain. General
                    McClellan was at Beverley reposing on his Rich Mountain laurels, where he and
                    Rosecrans had more thousands than Colonel Heck had hundreds, when the
                    administration at Washington in their dire discomfiture after the 21st of July,
                    sent for him to come, and that with all possible speed to take the command of
                    General McDowell's defeated and disorganized army, and on his arrival at
                    Washington, he was hailed as the "Young Napoleon." In approaching Northwestern
                    Virginia from the east, Beverley is the key to all that country, and none knew
                    this fact better than the Federals, and the boast was often made by even the
                    private Federal soldiers that "Beverley would never be taken," and this had been
                    the fear of our leaders that we would have to go around Beverley, and if
                    Beverley had not been captured, as the writer now views it, the Imboden raid
                    would have been a failure. The purpose of the raid was not to fight, but to
                    capture all the horses, mules and especially all cattle that could be gotten
                    within the  Federal lines, and after the evacuation of Beverley the
                    Confederate soldiers knew that there was no fortified town east of there, and
                    they also knew that all those rich counties in the Northwest, teeming with fine
                    horses and cattle, were completely at their mercy.</p>
<p>So on they went, and on the 30th day of April, General Roberts, commandant of the
                    Federal forces in that part of Virginia, with his chief, from Clarksburg, that
                    "the advance of Jones was at Shinnstown, seven miles north of him, and the
                    advance of Imboden and Jackson was eleven miles south of him on the Philippi
                    Road" (see page 1019, same Vol.), which dispatch
                    shows that things were getting very interesting around Federal headquarters at
                    that place. General Jones did his part well. He broke the Baltimore and Ohio
                    Railroad up so effectually, as the records show, as to strike terror to the
                    hearts of the enemy from Baltimore city to Wheeling. At the latter place the
                    militia was called out to defend the city, and the Constitutional Convention
                    that was in session at that time in Wheeling, that formed the State of West
                    Virginia, adjourned "sine die," and fled in disorder to the States of Ohio and
                    Pennsylvania. When near Clarksburg, General Jones rode with fully fifteen
                    hundred of his men towards Parkersburg, and came so near that place as to
                    produce great consternation, and the presence of a Yankee gunboat on the Ohio
                    River was what prohibited him from taking the place. The next day, forty miles
                    above Parkersburg, on the little Kanawha River, General Jones burnt the oil
                    works in Wirt county. Here was the biggest oil works in Virginia, and there was
                    immense quantities of barreled oil on hand. Some thousand men or more were
                    living here in shacks, engaged in the oil business.</p>
<p>The whole thing was completely wiped out with fire, and the soldiers who were
                    with General Jones, at this day, get excited when that fire is mentioned, so
                    terrific was it in appearance. In the meantime, General Imboden's command spread
                    all over the counties of Randolph, Barbour, Taylor, Monongahela, Upshur, Lewis,
                    Harrison and Doddridge, and from there gathered fully eight thousand fine cattle
                    and two thousand horses and mules. The writer was in a position to see most all
                    of this stock, nearly all of which was in splendid condition. When 
                    we met General Jones he had selected five hundred head of as fine cattle as ever
                    were in West Virginia, and the drovers and guards were directed to take them as
                    quickly as possible to General Lee's army. No country could have been more
                    abundantly supplied with live stock than all that fine grazing country of
                    Northwestern Virginia was at that time, and all of this stock, independently of
                    the sympathies of the owners, was brought back safely within the Confederate
                    lines. Many and pitiable were the scenes of women, girls and old men, pleading
                    for their horses and cattle, but the Confederate soldiers that had been sent
                    there to execute the orders of their government, did it faithfully. General
                    Jones completely remounted his entire brigade of cavalry with fresh horses, the
                    pick of the country, and ever since the Civil War, in that part of West Virginia
                    the Imboden raid has been regarded the greatest calamity that ever befell their
                    country.</p>
<p>RESULTS OF THE RAID.</p>
<p>The results of the Imboden raid, from a military standpoint were, to supply the
                    meat rations of General Lee's Army, and on the strength supplied by some of
                    those cattle the raid was made into Pennsylvania one month later, when the great
                    battle of Gettysburg was fought the first week of July, 1863. The war records
                    show another result was, General Benjamin S. Roberts was relieved of his command
                    in Western Virginia, and General William Woods Averill was appointed in his
                    place. The government at Washington was greatly displeased with General Roberts,
                    principally because he had allowed all that valuable property to be captured and
                    taken within the Confederate lines. Another result of the Imboden raid was the
                    assembling in West Virginia of what was known as the Eighth Army Corps, under
                    General Averill, for the purpose of destroying all the western part of Virginia
                    inside the Confederate lines, and the three successive raids made by him in
                    August, November and December of that year, the last raid ending up at Salem,
                        Va., where General Averill did so much damage
                    to the railroad and Confederate stores at that place. The political effect of
                    the "Imboden Raid" inside the Federal lines in that part  of the
                    State was very great. The people of those counties had long had their
                    grievances, real or imaginary, against the people of the Eastern counties, and
                    as has been said, there was a convention at that time then in session at the
                    city of Wheeling for the purpose of dividing the State. General Jones' near
                    approach to Wheeling was announced to the convention by a breathless messenger
                    while the convention, in a dignified way, was discusing some matter of great importance. The convention immediately
                    became a bedlam, and the members stampeded over each other in their scramble for
                    the street, and fled in great disorder in every direction.</p>
<p>And now, after the raid was over, and the members came back and looked each other
                    in the face, they felt greatly humiliated, and to aggravate this feeling the
                    news that all of the fine horses and cattle had been seized and taken back into
                    the Confederacy was brought from every part of the country. So upon the
                    reassembling of that convention it was an easy matter for it to publish to the
                    world on the 20th day of June, 1863, that "West Virginia shall be and remain one
                    of the United States of America." The formation and admission into the Union of
                    a new and loyal State, as well as the dismemberment of a disloyal one, had now
                    for two years been a pet measure with Mr. Lincoln, and so anxious was he to
                    encourage the people of Virginia west of the Alleghanies to form this new State,
                    that when he issued his famous emancipation proclamation on the 22d day of
                    September, 1862, to take effect one hundred days thereafter, was careful to
                    announce that his emancipation proclamation did not apply to the forty-eight
                    counties that constituted West Virginia, and that these counties "were left
                    precisely as if the proclamation had not been issued."</p>
<p>So the negroes of West Virginia were not freed by Abraham Lincoln's emancipation
                    proclamation.</p>
<p>The first and only time that we have any record of Mr. Lincoln being questioned
                    about the legality of the formation of West Virginia, was at Hampton Roads
                    conference, in February, 1865, when the Confederate State Senator R. M. T.
                    Hunter (see Stephen's History of the War Between the States, Vol. II., page 616) put the question personally and
                    directly to Mr. Lincoln to know what would be the result of a restoration of the
                    Union, according to his idea, as to Western Virginia: "Would the Old Dominion be
                    restored to her ancient boundaries, or would Western Virginia be recognized as a
                    separate State in the Union?" Mr. Lincoln replied "that he could only give an
                    individual opinion, which was that Western Virginia would be continued to be
                    recognized as a separate State in the Union," and he might have added, with all
                    truth, that the "Imboden Raid" had done more to crytallize local public sentiment in favor of the separate State of
                    West Virginia than all other agencies combined.</p>
