<h3 class="section-head">Augusta: "The Army Under Lincoln in West Virginia.," by S. T. Shank,
                            1913</h3>
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> In a brief article, S. T. Shank explains the organization of a regiment in the
                    Valley of Virginia by John D. Imboden.</p>
<p>It became apparent to the authorities at Richmond by the end of the first year of
                    the war that it was impracticable to keep an army in Western Virginia; but as
                    there were many men in that portion of the State who were Southern sympathizers,
                    and as something had to be done to prevent marauding parties from passing
                    through into the great Valley of Virginia, it was arranged to organize a
                    regiment of partisans to operate in those mountains and thus prevent these
                    raids. It was also known that many of those people would be willing to enlist in
                    a service of this kind who would never serve in the regular army. So Capt. John D. Imboden, who commanded the Stanton Artillery, and who had distinguished himself
                    in the first battle of Manassas, was appointed colonel and authorized to raise
                    such a command, having power to enlist any men not already in regular service.
                    Mountain howitzers to be carried on mules were furnished. In a short time the
                    regiment was raised; and uet the men came from the mountains until a brigade of
                    three regiments, one battalion, and a battery of six guns of mounted artillery
                    was enlisted. Imboden then was made a brigadier general, and his command did
                    efficient service until the close of the war, and it did what a much larger army
                    could not have done.</p>
<p>This brigade went with Lee to Gettysburg, being on the extreme left, crossing the
                    Potomac at Hancock, Md. It was also with Early
                    near Washington in 1864 that one of the regiments served General Lee's army and
                    took a prominent part in the battles of New Market, Piedmont, Lynchburg, and
                    many other engagements. The command was composed of the 62d Virginia Infantry,
                    the 18th and 23d Virginia Cavalry, White's Battalion, and McClanahan's
                Battery.</p>
