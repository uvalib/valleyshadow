                <p>Confederate Veteran Magazine prints a letter from 1863 that describes a
                    Confederate soldier's experiences around the time of Gettysburg, including the
                    battle itself as well as the relationship between Confederate soldiers and Union

                <p>The following letter was recently found in possession of a lady near Winchester,
                        <abbr expan="Virginia">Va.</abbr>, and the supposition is that it was picked
                    up near that town during the war. The letter was addressed to Miss Fannie
                    Coiner, Waynesboro, Augusta, <abbr expan="Virginia">Va.</abbr>, and was written
                    by <abbr expan="Doctor">Dr.</abbr> Casper Henkel.</p>
                <p>Miss Coiner married <abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Ben Patterson, of the 23rd
                    Regiment Virginia Cavalry; and, her husband being dead, she resides with her
                    children and grandchildren, all of whom have recently seen the letter that
                    remained undelivered for nearly forty-five years.</p>
                <p><abbr expan="Doctor">Dr.</abbr> Henkel has been one of the most prominent
                    physicians in the Valley of Virginia since the war, and is now seventy-three
                    years of age. Many old soldiers suffering from wounds received during the war
                    have gone to his home in later years and received surgical treatment as freely
                    and with as little thought of compensation as when he tenderly and untiringly
                    ministered to their needs on the field.</p>
                <p>LETTER TO MISS COINER.</p>
                <p>ON THE "FIELD," NEAR HAGERSTOWN, <abbr expan="MARYLAND">MD.</abbr>,<lb/> July 12,
                    1863.</p>
                <p><hi rend="underline">Dear Cousin</hi>: We were drawn up in line of battle
                    yesterday near Hagerstown and still lie in wait for the enemy to attack us-had
                    some picket firing last evening, and this morning the enemy's cavalry made an
                    attack upon our cavalry and on the left and drove in our pickets from Hagerstown
                    and now hold the town; captured some of our sharpshooters. <abbr expan="General"
                        >Gen.</abbr> A. P. Hill captured a large number of Yankee cavalry on the
                    right. Our men have thrown up breastworks on a good position, and feel confident
                    of giving the Yankees a whipping if they come up to them. It is now two o'clock
                    and no indications of an advance. The river has been past crossing for some
                    days, so that the most of our wagons still remain on this side; so should we be
                    repulsed, what a scatteration there will be! We must lose all. The pontoon
                    bridge will be completed <orig reg="today">to-day</orig>, and by morning the
                    river can be forded. If we had the Yankees in the fix they have had us in for
                    several days, I do not think many of them would escape. Our men and officers
                    seem very confident of saving all. Cattle and extra horses have been driven
                    across the river in large numbers. We crossed over the river on the 19th and
                    camped on the old battlefield near Sharpsburg. Since that time we have been
                    almost constantly on the march in battle line or fighting. We passed through
                    Hagerstown on to Greencastle and Mercersburg; there we (3d Brigade) took the
                        <orig reg="Pittsburgh">Pittsburg</orig> road and crossed over the North
                    Mountain to the town of McConnellsburg, Fulton County, <abbr
                        expan="Pennsylvania">Pa.</abbr>, where we frightened a body of "malich" and
                    heard of General Milroy at Bedford <abbr expan="Court House">C. H.</abbr></p>
                <p>We remained at McConnellsburg one day and took the road leading to Chambersburg,
                    where we rejoined our division, and marched on to Shippensburg and camped near
                    Carlisle. Here we remained a day, then made for Gettysburg, attacked the enemy
                    on the 1st, repulsed them in fine style, they admitting a loss of ten thousand
                    in killed, wounded, and prisoners. On the 2d they took a strong position east of
                    Gettysburg on a little mountain with very rugged sides, with a creek and marshes
                    around its base. Our troops attacked them furiously in this stronghold,
                    repulsing them at times, then being repulsed again. Our men fought desperately,
                    and overcame many almost incredible difficulties, but did not succeed in
                    dislodging the Yanks from their last stronghold.</p>
                <p>On the night of the 3d and 4th our army withdrew in their own time. The enemy
                    made a very feeble effort at pursuing us, only in sufficient force to pick up
                    stragglers and to watch our movements. Our losses are about ten or twelve
                    thousand killed or wounded. Our division (Johnston's) lost 1,142 men killed and
                    wounded; our brigade (Stuart's) lost 360 wounded, 84 killed; 37th Virginia had
                    44 wounded, 10 killed on the field, 1 lieutenant killed. The Northern papers
                    admit tremendous losses, some as many as forty thousand. We certainly failed in
                    our undertaking. General Lee was too confident in his men, expecting them to
                    overcome difficulties too great. Troops never fought better or more obstinately,
                    and succeed in driving the enemy whenever they could get to them. The enemy's
                    success was owing to their advantage in position, not in valor. My opinion is
                    that if General Lee had taken a position and allowed himself to be attacked he
                    would have been victorious. Our men were very much mortified at the result, but
                    say they can whip the Yanks-have done so and can whip them still.</p>
                <p>At no time during the engagement were our men panic-stricken or routed. Every one
                    seemed to turn his back on the enemy with regret. The roads were in wretched
                    condition from the heavy rains of the 4th, 5th, and 6th, which added much to the
                    depression which already weighed so heavily on us. Our wagon trains were
                    attacked on their way to Williamsport by Yankee cavalry and some wagons taken.
                    Our wagon train must have been twenty-five miles in length, and could not be
                    protected at all points. I have just seen Lieutenant Stephens, an ordinance
                    officer with Jenkins's Cavalry, and he states that he saw Major Eakle two hours
                    ago quite well. He is on our right two miles distant, and will be past here
                    today, provided the enemy attack us in passing to our left. I have seen very
                    little of the cavalry on this trip. They have always been in advance or on the
                    right or left.</p>
                <p>Very few bright faces or "God bless you!" have greeted us since we crossed the
                    river. The few sympathizers we meet are very cautious. A party called
                    "Copperhead" Democrats seem more free to meet us than any other party. They
                    profess to denounce Lincoln and cry for peace upon any terms. The citizens seem
                    to be much relieved that we do not give them their dues. We treat them civilly,
                    and not as they have treated us. Our officers do everything they can to protect
                    citizens and their property. As far as I am concerned, I do not care how much
                    property they destroy just so they respect the old and women and children.</p>
                <p>I have found it a very difficult matter to procure anything in the way of goods
                    that is desirable. Persons owning them are very loath to sell, and it requires a
                    permit from a major general to visit a town or to stop on the way. Jenkins has
                    been less lenient than any of the commanders. He has procured thousands of
                    horses and cattle. We have fared bountifully most of the time on butter, milk,
                    apple butter, and the nicest light bread I have ever seen. We have had a colored
                    man foraging for our mess, who has kept us very well supplied. He disappeared a
                    few days ago, however, with Colonel Williams's horse. Colonel Williams joined us
                    yesterday. He has been home since Chancellorsville fight; has almost recovered
                    from his wound. <abbr expan="Doctor">Dr.</abbr> Shultz Miller is with me now at
                    the hospital.</p>
                <p>As to the country through which we passed, it is beautiful and all the highest
                    state of cultivation. Most splendid barns and farm buildings I have seen. The
                    people are very much such people as we have in Shenandoah and Rockingham
                    Counties-the German portion.</p>
                <p>Mercersburg, Shippensburg, and Chambersburg are beautiful towns, and everything
                    unmolested by the war. I did not see <pb n="408"/> any of the Coiners about
                    Shippensburg and Carlisle. I learned they were quite numerous, some of them
                    Copperheads, others Lincolnites. I thought best not to visit them, as I could
                    not expect to be kindly received. Mr. John Alexander (of the 25th Virginia),
                    living near you, has just been to me to have a tooth extracted. He is quite
                    well, and says he saw a Mr. Gilkison, of the cavalry, who states that all the
                    Coiner boys are safe.</p>
                <p>The Winchester girls were all in fine glee when I saw them; but all look
                    careworn, having been under Yankee rule so long. The 13th Virginia Regiment has
                    been on duty since we took Winchester, which has given the boys a chance of
                    visiting their homes and being with friends.</p>
                <p>Four o'clock P.M. The pickets along the line are firing fiercely at this time;
                    otherwise all seems quiet. I have just received a lot of bandages, dressings,
                    candles, chloroform, morphia, sponges, etc., for field use, and have everything
                    in readiness for action. Eight o'clock P.M. I have just returned from the 14th
                    Regiment; saw Major Eakle. He has had much hard work. Your pet "Charlie," Major
                    Eakle's horse, was killed whilst the Major was leading a charge at Gettysburg.</p>
                <p>Thank your father for his kindness in visiting mother.</p>
                <p>Good-by. Your cousin,<lb/> Caspar C. Henkel.</p>
