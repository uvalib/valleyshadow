<h3 class="section-head">Augusta: "The Confederate Retreat from Gettysburg," by John D.
                            Imboden, Brigadier-General, C.S.A., 1887</h3>
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> In this lengthy article, General John D. Imboden provides his account of the
                    Confederate march from Gettysburg across the Potomac River. In the piece
                    published by The Century Company in Volume III of Battles and Leaders of the
                    Civil War, Imboden remembers the gruesome number of dying and wounded men,
                    marching through Franklin County, a skirmish in Williamsport, and personal
                    encounters with General Lee.</p>
<p>DURING the Gettysburg campaign, my command -- an independent brigade of cavalry
                    -- was engaged, by General Lee's confidential orders, in raids on the left flank
                    of his advancing army, destroying railroad bridges and cutting the canal below
                    Cumberland wherever I could -- so that I did not reach the field till noon of
                    the last day's battle. I reported direct to General Lee for orders, and was
                    assigned a position to aid in repelling any cavalry demonstration on his rear.
                    None of a serious character being made, my little force took no part in the
                    battle, but were merely spectators of the scene, which transcended in grandeur
                    any that I beheld in any other battle of the war.</p>
<p>When night closed the struggle, Lee's army was repulsed. We all knew that the day
                    had gone against us, but the full extent of the disaster was only known in high
                    quarters. The carnage of the day was generally understood to have been
                    frightful, yet our army was not in retreat, and it was surmised in camp that
                    with tomorrow's dawn would come a renewal of the struggle. All felt and
                    appreciated the momentous consequences to the cause of Southern independence of
                    final defeat or victory on that great field.</p>
<p>It was a warm summer's night; there were few camp-fires, and the weary soldiers
                    were lying in groups on the luxuriant grass of the beautiful meadows, discussing
                    the events of the day, speculating on the morrow, or watching that our horses
                    did not straggle off while browsing. About 11 o'clock a horseman came to summon
                    me to General Lee. I promptly mounted and, accompanied by Lieutenant George W.
                    McPhail, an aide on my staff, and guided by the courier who brought the message,
                    rode about two miles toward Gettysburg to where half a dozen small tents were
                    pointed out, a little way from the roadside to our left, as General Lee's
                    headquarters for the night. On inquiry I found that he was not there, but had
                    gone to the headquarters of General A. P. Hill, about half a mile nearer to
                    Gettysburg. When we reached the place indicated, a single flickering candle,
                    visible from the road through the open front of a common wall-tent, exposed to
                    view Generals Lee and Hill seated on camp stools with a map spread upon their
                    knees. Dismounting, I approached on foot. After exchanging the ordinary
                    salutations General Lee directed me to go back to his headquarters and wait for
                    him. I did so, but he did not make his appearance until about 1 o'clock, when he
                    came riding alone, at a slow walk, and evidently wrapped in profound thought.</p>
<p>When he arrived there was not even a sentinel on duty at his tent, and no one of
                    his staff was awake. The moon was high in the clear sky and the silent scene was
                    unusually vivid. As he approached and saw us lying on the  grass
                    under a tree, he spoke, reined in his jaded horse, and essayed to dismount. The
                    effort to do so betrayed so much physical exhaustion that I hurriedly rose and
                    stepped forward to assist him, but before I reached his side he had succeeded in
                    alighting, and threw his arm across the saddle to rest, and fixing his eyes upon
                    the ground leaned in silence and almost motionless upon his equally weary horse,
                    -- the two forming a striking and never-to-be-forgotten group. The moon shone
                    full upon his massive features and revealed an expression of sadness that I had
                    never before seen upon his face. Awed by his appearance I waited for him to
                    speak until the silence became embarrassing, when, to break it and change the
                    silent current of his thoughts, I ventured to remark, in a sympathetic tone, and
                    in allusion to his great fatigue:</p>
<p>"General, this has been a hard day on you."</p>
<p>He looked up, and replied mournfully:</p>
<p>"Yes, it has been a sad, sad day to us," and immediately relapsed into his
                    thoughtful mood and attitude. Being unwilling again to intrude upon his
                    reflections, I said no more. After perhaps a minute or two, he suddenly
                    straightened up to his full height, and turning to me with more animation and
                    excitement of manner than I had ever seen in him before, for he was a man of
                    wonderful equanimity, he said in a voice tremulous with emotion:</p>
<p>"I never saw troops behave more magnificently than Pickett's division of
                    Virginians did to-day in that grand charge upon the
                    enemy. And if they had been supported as they were to have been, -- but, for
                    some reason not yet fully explained to me, were not, -- we would have held the
                    position and the day would have been ours." After a moment's pause he added in
                    aloud voice, in a tone almost of agony, "Too bad! Too bad! OH! Too BAD!"</p>
<p>I shall never forget his language, his manner, and his appearance of mental
                    suffering. In a few moments all emotion was suppressed, and he spoke feelingly
                    of several of his fallen and trusted officers; among others of
                    Brigadier-Generals Armistead, Garnett, and Kemper of Pickett's division. He
                    invited me into his tent, and as soon as we were seated he remarked: </p>
<p>"We must now return to Virginia. As many of our poor wounded as possible must be
                    taken home. I have sent for you, because your men and horses are fresh and in
                    good condition, to guard and conduct our train back to Virginia. The duty will
                    be arduous, responsible, and dangerous, for I am afraid you will be harassed by
                    the enemy's cavalry. How many men have you?"</p>
<p>"About 2100 effective present, and all well mounted, including McClanahan's
                    six-gun battery of horse artillery."</p>
<p>"I can spare you as much artillery as you require," he said, "but no other
                    troops, as I shall need all I have to return safely by a different and shorter
                    route than yours. The batteries are generally short of ammunition, but you will
                    probably meet a supply I have ordered from Winchester to Williamsport. Nearly
                    all the transportation and the care of all the wounded will be intrusted to you.
                    You will recross the mountain by the Chambersburg
                    road, and then proceed to Williamsport by any route you deem best, and without a
                    halt till you reach the river. Rest there long enough to feed your animals; then
                    ford the river, and do not halt again till you reach Winchester, where I will
                    again communicate with you."</p>
<p>After a good deal of conversation about roads, and the best disposition of my
                    forces to cover and protect the vast train, he directed that the chiefs of his
                    staff departments should be waked up to receive, in my presence, his orders to
                    collect as early next day as possible all the wagons and ambulances which I was
                    to convoy, and have them in readiness for me to take command of them. His
                    medical director [Dr. Lafayette Guild] was charged to see that all the wounded
                    who could bear the rough journey should be placed in the empty wagons and
                    ambulances. He then remarked to me that his general instructions would be sent
                    to me in writing the following morning. As I was about leaving to return to my
                    camp, as late, I think, as 2 A. M., he came out of his tent to where I was about
                    to mount, and said in an undertone: "I will place in your hands by a
                    staff-officer, to-morrow morning, a sealed package
                    for President Davis, which you will retain in your possession till you are
                    across the Potomac, when you will detail a reliable commissioned officer to take
                    it to Richmond with all possible dispatch and deliver it into the President's
                    own hands. And I impress it on you that, whatever happens, this package must not
                    fall into the hands of the enemy. If unfortunately you should be captured,
                    destroy it at the first opportunity."</p>
<p>On the morning of July 4th my written instructions, and a large official envelope
                    addressed to President Davis, were handed to me by a staff-officer. It was
                    apparent by 9 o'clock that the wagons, ambulances, and wounded could not be
                    collected and made ready to move till late in the afternoon. General Lee sent to
                    me eight Napoleon guns of the famous Washington Artillery of New Orleans, under
                    the immediate command of Major Eshleman, one of the best artillery officers in
                    the army, a four-gun battery under Captain Tanner, and a Whitworth under
                    Lieutenant Pegram. Hampton's cavalry brigade, then under command of Colonel P.
                    M. B. Young, with Captain James F. Hart's four-gun battery of horse artillery,
                    was ordered to cover the rear of all trains  moving under my convoy
                    on the Chambersburg road. These 17 guns and McClanahan's 6 guns gave us 23
                    pieces in all for the defense of the trains.</p>
<p>Shortly after noon of the 4th the very windows of heaven seemed to have opened.
                    The rain fell in blinding sheets; the meadows were soon overflowed and fences
                    gave way before the raging streams. During the storm, wagons, ambulances, and
                    artillery carriages by hundreds -- nay, by thousands -- were assembling in the
                    fields along the road from Gettysburg to Cashtown, in one confused and
                    apparently inextricable mass. As the afternoon wore on there was no abatement in
                    the storm. Canvas was no protection against its fury, and the wounded men lying
                    upon the naked boards of the wagon-bodies were drenched. Horses and mules were
                    blinded and maddened by the wind and water, and became almost unmanageable. The
                    deafening roar of the mingled sounds of heaven and earth all around us made it
                    almost impossible to communicate orders, and equally difficult to execute them.</p>
<p>About 4 P. M. the head of the column was put in motion near Cashtown, and began
                    the ascent of the mountain in the direction of Chambersburg. I remained at
                    Cashtown giving directions and putting in detachments of guns and troops at what
                    I estimated to be intervals of a quarter or a third of a mile. It was found from
                    the position of the head of the column west of the mountain at dawn of the 5th
                    -- the hour at which Young's cavalry and Hart's battery began the ascent of the
                    mountain near Cashtown -- that the entire column was seventeen miles long when
                    drawn out on the road and put in motion. As an advance-guard I had placed the
                    18th Virginia Cavalry, Colonel George W. Imboden, in front with a section of
                    McClanahan's battery.  Next to them, by request, was placed an
                    ambulance carrying, stretched side by side, two of North Carolina's most
                    distinguished soldiers, Generals Pender and Scales, both badly wounded, but
                    resolved to bear the tortures of the journey rather than become prisoners. I
                    shared a little bread and meat with them at noon, and they waited patiently for
                    hours for the head of the column to move. The trip cost poor Pender his life.
                    General Scales appeared to be worse hurt, but stopped at Winchester, recovered,
                    and fought through the war.</p>
<p>After dark I set out from Cashtown to gain the head of the column during the
                    night. My orders had been peremptory that there should be no halt for any cause
                    whatever. If an accident should happen to any vehicle, it was immediately to be
                    put out of the road and abandoned. The column moved rapidly, considering the
                    rough roads and the darkness, and from almost every wagon for many miles issued
                    heart-rending wails of agony. For four hours I hurried forward on my way to the
                    front, and in all that time I was never out of hearing of the groans and cries
                    of the wounded and dying. Scarcely one in a hundred had received adequate
                    surgical aid, owing to the demands on the hard-working surgeons from still worse
                    cases that had to be left behind. Many of the wounded in the wagons had been
                    without food for thirty-six hours. Their torn and bloody clothing, matted and
                    hardened, was rasping the tender, inflamed, and still oozing wounds. Very few of
                    the wagons had even a layer of straw in them, and all were without springs. The
                    road was rough and rocky from the heavy washings of the preceding day. The
                    jolting was enough to have killed strong men, if long exposed to it. From nearly
                    every wagon as the teams trotted on, urged by whip and shout, came such cries
                    and shrieks as these:</p>
<p>"O God! why can't I die?"</p>
<p>"My God! will no one have mercy and kill me?"</p>
<p>"Stop! Oh! for God's sake, stop just for one minute; take me out and leave me to
                    die on the roadside."</p>
<p>"I am dying! I am dying! My poor wife, my dear children, what will become of
                    you?"</p>
<p>Some were simply moaning; some were praying, and others uttering the most fearful
                    oaths and execrations that despair and agony could wring from them; while a
                    majority, with a stoicism sustained by sublime devotion to the, cause they
                    fought for, endured without complaint unspeakable tortures, and even spoke words
                    of cheer and comfort to their unhappy comrades of less will or more acute
                    nerves. Occasionally a wagon would be passed from which only, low, deep moans
                    could be heard. No help could be rendered to any of the sufferers. No heed could
                    be given to any of their appeals. Mercy and duty to the many forbade the loss of
                    a moment in the vain effort then and there to comply with the prayers of the
                    few. On! On! we must move on. The storm continued, and the darkness was
                    appalling. There was no time even to fill a canteen with water for a dying man;
                    for, except the drivers and the guards, all were wounded and utterly helpless in
                    that vast procession of misery. During this one night I realized more of the
                    horrors of war than I had in all the two preceding years.  And yet
                    in the darkness was our safety, for no enemy would dare attack where he could
                    not distinguish friend from foe. We knew that hen day broke upon us we should be
                    harassed by bands of cavalry hanging on our flanks. Therefore our aim was to go
                    as far as possible under cover of the night. Instead of going through
                    Chambersburg, I decided to leave he main road near Fairfield after crossing the
                    mountains, and take "a near cut" across the country to Greencastle, where
                    daybreak on the morning of the 5th of July found the head of our column. We were
                    now twelve or fifteen miles from the Potomac at Williamsport, our point of
                    crossing into Virginia.</p>
<p>Here our apprehended troubles began. After the advance -- the 18th Virginia
                    Cavalry -- had passed perhaps a mile beyond the town, the citizens to the number
                    of thirty or forty attacked the train with axes, cutting the spokes out of ten
                    or a dozen wheels and dropping the wagons in the streets. The moment I heard of
                    it I sent back a detachment of cavalry to capture every citizen who had been
                    engaged in this work, and treat them as prisoners of war. This stopped the
                    trouble there, but the Union cavalry began to swarm down upon us from the fields
                    and cross-roads, making their attacks in small bodies, and striking the column
                    where there were few or no guards, and thus creating great confusion. I had a
                    narrow escape from capture by one of these parties -- of perhaps fifty men that
                    I tried to drive off with canister from two of McClanahan's guns that were close
                    at hand. They would perhaps have been too much for me, had not Colonel Imboden,
                    hearing the firing turned back with his regiment at a gallop, and by the
                    suddenness of his movement surrounded and caught the entire party.</p>
<p>To add to our perplexities still further, a report reached me a little after
                    sunrise, that the Federals in large force held Williamsport. I did not fully
                    credit this, and decided to push on. Fortunately the report was untrue. After a
                    great deal of desultory fighting and harassments along the road during the day,
                    nearly the whole of the immense train reached Williamsport on the afternoon of
                    the 5th. A part of it, with Hart's battery, came in next day, General Young
                    having halted and turned his attention to guarding the road from the west with
                    his cavalry. We took possession of the town to convert it into a great hospital
                    for the thousands of wounded we had brought from Gettysburg. I required all the
                    families in the place to go to cooking for the sick and wounded, on pain of
                    having their kitchens occupied for that purpose by my men. They readily
                    complied. A large number of surgeons had accompanied the train, and these at
                    once pulled off their coats and went to work, and soon a vast amount of
                    suffering was mitigated. The bodies of a few who had died on the march were
                    buried. All this became necessary because the tremendous rains had raised the
                    river more than ten feet above the fording stage of water, and we could not
                    possibly cross then. There were two small ferry-boats or "flats" there, which I
                    immediately put into requisition to carry across those of the wounded, who,
                    after being fed and having their wounds dressed, thought they could walk to
                    Winchester. Quite a large number were able to do this, so that the "flats" were
                    kept running all the time. </p>
<p>Our situation was frightful. We had probably ten thousand animals and nearly all
                    the wagons of General Lee's army under our charge, and all the wounded, to the
                    number of several thousand, that could be brought from Gettysburg. Our supply of
                    provisions consisted of a few wagon-loads of flour in my own brigade train, a
                    small lot of fine fat cattle which I had collected in Pennsylvania on my way to
                    Gettysburg, and some sugar and coffee procured in the same way at Mercersburg.</p>
<p>The town of Williamsport is located in the lower angle formed by the Potomac with
                    Conococheague Creek. These streams inclose [sic] the town on two sides, and back
                    of it about one mile there is a low range of hills that is crossed by four roads
                    converging at the town. The first is the Greencastle road leading down the creek
                    valley; next the Hagerstown road; then the Boonsboro' road; and lastly the River
                    road.</p>
<p>Early on the morning of the 6th I received intelligence of the approach from
                    Frederick of a large body of cavalry with three full batteries of six rifled
                    guns. These were the divisions of Generals Buford and Kilpatrick, and Huey's
                    brigade of Gregg's division, consisting, as I afterward learned, of 23 regiments
                    of cavalry, and 18 guns, a total force of about 7000 men.</p>
<p>I immediately posted my guns on the hills that concealed the town, and dismounted
                    my own command to support them -- and ordered as many of the wagoners to be
                    formed as could be armed with the guns of the wounded that we had brought from
                    Gettysburg. In this I was greatly aided by Colonel J. L. Black of South
                    Carolina, Captain J. F. Hart commanding a battery from  the same
                    State, Colonel William R. Aylett of Virginia, and other wounded officers. By
                    noon about 700 wagoners were organized into companies of 100 each and officered
                    by wounded line-officers and commissaries and quartermasters, -- about 250 of
                    these were given to Colonel Aylett on the right next the river, -- about as many
                    under Colonel Black on the left, and the residue were used as skirmishers. My
                    own command proper was held well in hand in the center.</p>
<p>The enemy appeared in our front about half-past one o'clock on both the
                    Hagerstown and Boonsboro' roads, and the fight began. Every man under my command
                    understood that if we did not repulse the enemy we should all be captured and
                    General Lee's army be ruined by the loss of its transportation, which at that
                    period could not have been replaced in the Confederacy. The fight began with
                    artillery on both sides. The firing from our side was very rapid, and seemed to
                    make the enemy hesitate about advancing. In a half hour J. D. Moore's battery
                    ran out of ammunition, but as an ordnance train had arrived from Winchester, two
                    wagon-loads of ammunition were ferried across the river and run upon the field
                    behind the guns, and the boxes tumbled out, to be broken open with axes. With
                    this fresh supply our guns were all soon in full play again. As the enemy could
                    not see the supports of our batteries from the hill-tops, I moved the whole line
                    forward to his full view, in single ranks, to show a long front on the
                    Hagerstown approach. My line passed our guns fifty or one hundred yards, where
                    they were halted awhile, and then were withdrawn behind the hill-top again,
                    slowly and steadily.</p>
<p>Leaving Black's wagoners and the Marylanders on the left to support Hart's and
                    Moore's batteries, Captain Hart having been put in command by Colonel Black when
                    he was obliged to be elsewhere, I moved the 18th Virginia Cavalry and 62d
                    Virginia Mounted Infantry rapidly to the right, to meet and repel five advancing
                    regiments (dismounted) of the enemy. My three regiments, with Captain John H.
                    McNeill's Partisan Rangers and Aylett's wagoners, had to sustain a very severe
                    contest. Hart, seeing how hard we were pressed on the right, charged the enemy's
                    right with his little command, and at the same time Eshleman with his eight
                    Napoleons advanced four hundred yards to the front, and got an enfilading
                    position, from which, with the aid of McClanahan's battery, he poured a furious
                    fire into the enemy's line. The 62d and Aylett, supported by the 18th Cavalry,
                    and McNeill, charged the enemy who fell back sullenly to their horses.</p>
<p>Night was now rapidly approaching, when a messenger from Fitzhugh Lee arrived to
                    urge me to "hold my own," as he would be up in a half hour with three thousand
                    fresh men. The news was sent along our whole line, and was received with a wild
                    and exultant yell. We knew then that the field was won, and slowly pressed
                    forward. Almost at the same moment we heard distant guns on the enemy's rear and
                    right on the Hagerstown road. They were Stuart's, who was approaching on that
                    road, while Fitzhugh Lee was coming on the Greencastle road. That settled the
                    contest. The enemy broke to the left and fled by the Boonsboro' road. It was too
                    dark to follow. When General Fitzhugh Lee joined me with his staff on the field,
                    one of  the enemy's shells came near striking him. General Lee
                    thought it came from Eshleman's battery, till, a moment later, he saw a blaze
                    from its gun streaming away from us.</p>
<p>We captured about 125 of the enemy who failed to reach their horses. I could
                    never ascertain the loss on either side. I estimated ours at about 125. The
                    wagoners fought so well that this came to be known as "the wagoners' fight."
                    Quite a number of them were killed in storming a farm from which sharp-shooters
                    were rapidly picking off Eshleman's men and horses.</p>
<p>My whole force engaged, wagoners included, did not exceed three thousand men. The
                    ruse practiced by showing a formidable line on the left, the withdrawing it to
                    fight on the right, together with our numerous artillery, 23 guns, led to the
                    belief that our force was much greater.</p>
<p>By extraordinary good fortune we had thus saved all of General Lee's trains. A
                    bold charge at any time before sunset would have broken our feeble lines, and
                    then we should all have fallen an easy prey to the Federals. The next day our
                    army arrived from Gettysburg, and the country is familiar with the way it
                    escaped across the Potomac on the night of the 13th of July.</p>
<p>It may be interesting to repeat one or two facts to show the peril in which the
                    army was till the river could be bridged. Over four thousand prisoners taken at
                    Gettysburg were ferried across the river by the morning of the 9th, and I was
                    ordered with a single regiment, the 62d Virginia, to guard them to Staunton and
                    send them on to Richmond. When the general assigned me to this duty he expressed
                    an apprehension that before I could reach Winchester the Federal cavalry would
                    cross at Harper's Ferry, intercept and capture my guard and release the
                    prisoners. Before we had left the river I had an interview with him at his
                    headquarters near Hagerstown, in which he expressed great impatience at the
                    tardiness in building rude pontoons at the river, and calling in Colonel James
                    L. Corley, his chief quartermaster, told him to put Major John A. Harman in
                    charge of the work; remarking that without Harman's extraordinary energy to
                    conduct the work, the pontoons would not be done for several days. Harman took
                    charge that day, and by tearing down warehouses on the canal got joists to build
                    boats with, and in twenty-four hours had enough of them ready to float down to
                    Falling Waters and construct a bridge. As we were talking General Longstreet
                    came into the tent, wet and muddy, and was cordially greeted by General Lee in
                    this wise: "Well, my old warhorse, what news do you bring us from the front?"
                    That cordial greeting between chief and lieutenant is a sufficient answer, in my
                    mind, to the statements of alleged ill feeling between the two men growing out
                    of affairs at Gettysburg. It has been said that if "Stonewall" Jackson had been
                    in command at Gettysburg, Longstreet would have been shot. This is a monstrous
                    imputation upon General Lee, no less than upon Longstreet, and utterly without
                    foundation, in my opinion. They were surely cordial on the 9th of July,1863.</p>
<p>Before I had gone two miles on my anxious march toward Winchester a courier
                    overtook me with a note from General Lee directing me to return immediately to
                    his headquarters. I halted my column, hurried back, was ferried over the river,
                    and galloped out on the Hagerstown road to where I had  parted from
                    the general that morning. He had left with his staff to ride toward Hagerstown,
                    where a heavy artillery fire indicated an attack by the enemy in considerable
                    force. When I overtook him he said that he understood I was familiar with the
                    fords of the Potomac from Williamsport to Cumberland, and with the roads to
                    them. I replied that I was. He then called up one of his staff, either General
                    Long or General Alexander, I think, and directed him to write down my answers to
                    his questions, and required me to name and describe ford after ford all the way
                    up to Cumberland, and to describe minutely their character, and the roads and
                    surrounding country on both sides of the river, and directed me, after I had
                    given him all the information I could, to send to him my brother and his
                    regiment, the 18th Virginia Cavalry, to act as an advance and guide if he should
                    require it. He did not say so, but I felt that his situation was precarious in,
                    the extreme. When about to dismiss me, referring to the freshet in the river he
                    laughingly said: "You know this country well enough to tell me whether it ever
                    quits raining about here? If so, I should like to see a clear day soon." I did
                    not see him again till he left the Shenandoah Valley for the east side of the
                    Blue Ridge.</p>
